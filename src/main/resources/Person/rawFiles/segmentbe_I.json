He took his baccalaureate at the University of Copenhagen in 1648. Leganger first worked during 1656 as personnel chaplain for his father in Leikanger. Leganger was priest in Vik from 1657 and dean in Sogn from 1668. He became the owner of several farms in Vik and elsewhere in Sogn. Leganger was also a historical and topographical author. Leganger had traveled in his youth extensively in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. Many of his cadastre surveys and maps are deposited at the library of the University of Trondheim. He is particularly known for his historical and topographical descriptions of Sogn written largely in Latin, Circa brevissimam Sogniæ chorographiam. Leganger also compiled a theological dissertation in Latin, Simplicissima Textus Prophetici expositio, Esaiæ LV. 6–7 (1692), regarding the writings of the prophet Isaiah. At the Hopperstad Stave Church there is a plaque (with text in Latin) memorializing Leganger on a church wall."

  "text" : "Isabel Egenton Ostrander (1883–1924) was a mystery writer of the early twentieth century who used, besides her own name, the pseudonyms Robert Orr Chipperfield, David Fox, and Douglas Grant. Christopher B. Booth is sometimes (falsely) credited as a pseudonym of hers. She was born in New York City to Thomas E Ostrander and Harriet Elizabeth Bradbrook. Her Ostrander pedigree goes back to seventeenth century Kingston, New York. In the discussions of which writer invented the blind detective, Ostrander is one of the candidates. The first book publication of her Damon Gaunt is a 1915 novel At One-Thirty, but there might be a misplaced earlier short story: periodical publication of many mystery short story writers is often lost or partial. For example, blind detective Thornley Colton appeared in some short stories in People's Ideal Fiction Magazine in early 1913 that weren't collected in book form until 1915, while Max Carrados by Ernest Bramah reached the periodicals in 1913, but anthologization in 1914. In no case is bibliography complete for periodicals, and either might be the first, though Max Carrados was the first in book publication. In the 1920s, Ostrander was notable enough that Agatha Christie parodied her in her Tommy and Tuppence anthology, Partners in Crime. We find Tommy and Tuppence modeling their detective skills after Ostrander's characters, McCarty and Riordan."

  "text" : "Isabel Scott Rorick (1900–1967) was an American author known for her comedic book Mr. and Mrs. Cugat, which was one of the top ten best selling books in the United States in 1941. Rorick was born in Toledo, Ohio in 1900. Her involvement in the local Junior League newsletter in the mid-1930s eventually led to her contributing fictional sketches to the national Junior League publication. Her stories about the married Cugat couple, a young bank executive and his wife, led to interest by Houghton Mifflin, and ten sketches complete with illustrations were published in October 1940 as Mr. and Mrs. Cugat, the Record of a Happy Marriage. It became one of the best selling books of 1941. It was also made into a movie in 1942, Are Husbands Necessary? starring Ray Milland and Betty Field as the Cugats. Rorick published a follow-up collection of Cugat stories, Outside Eden, in November 1945. In 1948, the radio show My Favorite Husband based on the Cugat stories debuted on CBS Radio. Lucille Ball and Richard Denning played the Cugats, though their last name was soon changed to Cooper to avoid confusion with bandleader Xavier Cugat. When CBS asked Ball to do a television version of the show, she insisted that her husband Desi Arnaz play her husband on the show. Since Arnaz could not pull off the role of a midwestern banker, the show was reworked into what became I Love Lucy. Rorick's husband, Ceilan H. Rorick, a banker in the Spitzer-Rorick Trust and Savings Bank of Toledo, died in June 1958. Rorick died in 1967. They are buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Toledo. The couple had two children, Horton and Elizabeth (Mimi)."

He is the author of the famous book 'Ad-Dayl wa Takmila', a substantial collection of biographies of notable people from Morocco and al-Andalus. The book is composed of 9 volumes with approximately 700 pages each of which only 4 volumes reached us entirely (Volumes 1, 5, 6, 8 and parts of 2 and 4). It contains many intricate details, such as the exact pronunciation of names which isn't always accurately rendered in the Arabic writing system. In 1300, Ibn abd al-Malik left Marrakech following the court of the Marinid King Abu Yaqub Yusuf an-Nasr and settled in Mansourah, where the Marinids were besieging Tlemcen in an attempt to oust the Abd al-Wadid dynasty. He seems to have died there three years later in September 1303, though there were reports of him being at Aghmat only three months earlier. Ibn abd al-Malik spent his life writing his biographical dictionary \"ad-Dayl wa Takmila\" which was completed only a few months before his death. The book was originally designed to complete the works of Ibn Bashkuwal and Ibn al-Faradi, but eventually surpassed them. He had a son who settled in Málaga where he became a close friend of Ibn al-Khatib. The latter based much of his biographical book Al-Ihata on the works of Ibn abd al-Malik."

Kalynets was the wife of another leading Soviet dissident, Ihor Kalynets. Kalynets graduated from Lviv University with a degree in philology. She taught courses in Ukrainian literature and language before joining a human rights group called \"shistdesyatnyky.\" Kalynets was the publisher of a banned human rights journal, \"Український Вісник.\" She also publicly protested the detention of other dissidents, including Nina Strokata and Valentyn Moroz. Kalynets and two other activists, Nadiya Svitlychna and Stefania Shabatura, were arrested for a writing on Soviet propaganda. She was sentenced to six years in prison and three years of internal exile within the Soviet Union. Kalynets was able to return to Lviv in 1981 following the completion of her sentence. A proponent of the Ukrainian independence movement, she soon joined Memorial and Rukh, a pair of civil rights organizations. Ukraine broke away from the Soviet Union in 1991. Kalynets was elected to the Verkhovna Rada as a deputy in Ukraine's first post independence parliament. She continued to publish writings until her health deteriorated. Iryna Kalynets died from a long illness on July 31, 2012, at the age of 71."

  "text" : "Ira Bowman Thompson (April 9, 1889 – August 10, 1973) was a politician, Ku Klux Klan leader, and attorney from the U.S. state of Alabama. Thompson was born to Albert and Laura (née Crabtree) Thompson at Bay Minette, Alabama in 1889. After attending school in Bay Minette, Thompson attended the University of Alabama and Meridian College in Mississippi, graduating from the latter in 1910. Thompson then entered into military service, eventually becoming Captain of Company B of the 1st Alabama Infantry in 1915. He also served a brief term in the Alabama House of Representatives as a representative for Baldwin County in that same year. He was admitted to the bar in 1916 but he was quickly called into federal military service in 1917 when he was sent to France in 1918 to command a Prisoner of War camp until the prisoners were repatriated back to Germany in 1919. After his return to the United States, Thompson opened a law practice in Luverne, Alabama and arranged Battery A of the 141st Field Artillery in the National Guard, which he would later resign from in 1932. Thompson was an active member of the local Ku Klux Klan organization in Crenshaw County and Luverne in the late 1920s, serving as the exalted cyclops of the Crenshaw KKK around 1927 and 1928. In October 1927, Thompson, along with 35 other suspected Klansmen were all indicted by the Crenshaw County grand jury on the basis of their participation of floggings throughout the county. The case, however was dropped later in December by the attorney general's withdrawal on his belief that the state police had assisted the Klan. Less than a year after Thompson's indictment, Governor Bibb Graves appointed him the prosecuting attorney of Crenshaw County. In 1927, Thompson was appointed solicitor of Luverne, and was re-elected to two more consecutive terms in 1928 and 1932. He was called back to active military service in 1942 when he was a captain in the military police corps. He had previously served as the attorney for Crenshaw County since 1941. He sat once again in the Alabama House of Representatives, this time for Crenshaw County as a Democrat from 1943 until 1951. Thompson married Eugenia Marie Little in 1917. They had one child, Mary Eugenia. He was an active community member, sitting on the state athletic commission, Luverne's education board, founding the Lurverne Bank and Trust Company, and serving as a member in the local Lion's Club, Red Cross and American Legion. He also taught Sunday school at his church for over 30 years. He died in 1973 in Luverne."

  "text" : "Ida Betty Odinga (born Ida Anyango Oyoo in 1950) is a Kenyan businesswoman, activist and educator. She is the wife of Raila Odinga, the former Prime Minister of Kenya. Odinga earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Nairobi in 1974 when she was 24 years old. She worked as a teacher for more than twenty years after graduation. She married Raila Odinga, with whom she has four children. Raila Odinga was imprisoned in 1982 as a political prisoner by the government of President Daniel arap Moi. Ida Odinga largely raised her children herself during those years while working as a teacher. Odinga founded the League of Kenya Women Voters in 1991, which promotes opportunities for women in the political arena. She served as the chairperson of the League. She has also championed a host of other causes, many focused on women, children and health in Kenya. Odinga has advocated for the prevention of breast cancer and fistulas, and eradication of the chigoe flea. She has also mentored Kenyan schoolgirls and sat on the board of directors for an organization which aids paraplegics. She became the managing director of the East African Spectre, a liquified gas cylinder manufacturing company, in 2003, becoming one of the first women to head a major Kenyan corporation. In 2010, Standard Digital News named her the second most powerful woman in Kenya. In a 2012 interview with CNN International, Odinga elaborated on her life as a politician's wife. She told CNN's Felicia Taylor, \"It's good to be a wife, but it's good to be an educated wife. Being a wife, it's just not a position of subordination -- it's a position of strength.\""

On December 22, 1990, Dési Bouterse resigned as commander of the army, because of the growing disagreement between him and President Ramsewak Shankar. Bouterse was against Shankar's policy to develop relations with the Dutch government. He also felt that Shankar did not defend him enough, when he was blocked at the airport by the Dutch police as he tried to speak to the present Surinamese people. Graanoogst replaced him as commander of the army. Two days after Bouterse's resignation, Shankar's government was overthrown in a military coup by Graanoogst and Bouterse, known as the Telephone Coup. Graanoogst ruled temporarily for five days, up to 29 December 1990, when the National Military Council decided to hand over power to Johan Kraag. In August 2010, when Desi Bouterse became the president of Suriname, he appointed Graanoogst as Secretary of the cabinet."

  "text" : "Israel Worsley (1768−1836) was an English Unitarian minister. Born at Hertford in 1768, Israel Worsley entered at Daventry Academy in 1786, under Thomas Belsham who made him a Unitarian. In December 1790 a committee of merchants at Dunkirk (a French port where there was no English service) engaged Worsley as their minister, the services to be conducted with a ‘Book of Common Prayer compiled for the use of the English Church at Dunkirk . . . with a Collection of Psalms,’' Dunkirk, 1791, 12mo. The volume was reprinted in Fragmenta Liturgica (1848, vol. vi.) by Peter Hall, who seemed unaware that it was itself a reprint of the ‘reformed’ prayer book of Theophilus Lindsey. How long this experiment lasted is not certain. Worsley established a school at Dunkirk. After the outbreak of the war between Britain and France in 1793 he made his way to England, but returned after the peace of Amiens (1802), only to be arrested on the resumption of hostilities (1803), ultimately making his escape with difficulty through the Netherlands. From 1806 to 1813 he ministered at Lincoln, and from 1813 to February 1831 at Plymouth, where he established a fellowship fund and a chapel library. He left Plymouth with his family for Paris, intending a six months' stay, but was persuaded to open (in June) a place for Unitarian worship (in the Rue de Provence). In January 1832 he formed a French Unitarian association for circulation of tracts. The cholera of March 1832 dispersed his congregation, but he kept his chapel open till June 1833. Returning to England, he again ministered at Lincoln (1833−6)."

Her first name is sometimes misspelled as Let, and her last name is often given as Koster–van Feggelen or Koster due to her marriage to the Dutch water polo player Ko Koster in 1943. Her career was hampered by World War II, yet she won two medals at the 1938 and 1947 European Aquatics Championships and set eleven world records between 1938 and 1947. After retirement, she became a national coach in conventional and synchronized swimming. In 2009, she was inducted to the International Swimming Hall of Fame."

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1786), second-born son of don Antonio Flores, the 1st Marquis of Miraflores, was the first governor of the province of Moxos from 1772 to 1781 and the 20th president of the Royal Court of Charcas from 1781 to 1785. A refined and cultured man, he embodied the best human qualities of optimism, generosity and idealism of the Spanish American enlightenment in the late 18th century. He taught the humanities and mathematics at the Royal Seminary of Nobles of Madrid. Upon his return to America, as a colonel in the Royal Army, he set about the arduous tasks of keeping the Portuguese from gaining control of the banks of the Madera, Mamoré and Itenez waterways in the upper Amazon Basin and of pacifying the rebellious Aymara Indians led by Tupac Katari, who in 1781, in present-day Bolivia, had laid siege to the city of La Paz for several months as part of a failed Andean rebellion against Spanish domination. This Creole from Quito who was a fluent Aymara-speaker (he also spoke Quechua) was able to break the siege imposed on La Paz and to save the lives of its residents, only to face \"one of the most profoundly unjust deaths recorded in the annals of Spanish American history.\" He was summarily removed from office, replaced with a heavy dose of nepotism by the Minister of the Indies José de Gálvez's nephew, and charged with \"false pacification\" for having displayed a minimum of decency and sympathy with the rebel leaders. He died in a loathsome dungeon, in mysterious circumstances, while placed under arrest by the viceroy of Buenos Aires; he supposedly left an unsigned and apocryphal last will and testament, clearly falsified as part of an official cover-up about his death. During the many decades of struggle for independence from Spain in the 19th century, Flores became a symbol for a series of injustices perpetrated by European-born Spaniards against the Creole upper class in the Spanish Americas."

  "text" : "Dr. Ivo Stern (24 December 1889 – 1961) was Croatian lawyer, writer, journalist, director and founder of the \"Zagreb Radiostation\" (now Croatian Radiotelevision). Stern was born to a wealthy Jewish family on 24 December 1889 in Zagreb. He studied and graduated at the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb in 1913. After graduation he practiced the law for a while. After World War I, in which he participated as a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Stern lived in Vienna. In 1926 as the head of the Zagreb group of bankers and industrials, despite the opposition from Belgrade, Stern founded the \"Zagreb Radiostation\". Stern was first director and major shareholder of the \"Zagreb Radiostation\". He was also the program editor until 1938. Stern was close friend of Croatian writer Milan Begović. Distinctly higher in education, polyglot, charming and elegant, financially independent, Stern fraternize with many Croatian writers. His apartment in Jurišićeva street was a place of elegant banquets. He was a member of the Croatian Freemasonry and founder of the elite \"Rotary Club\" which had predominantly Masonic membership. Stern wrote left pacifist oriented emphatic expressive poetry, which was published in the magazine \"Plamen\". He also wrote political feuilletons. One of his feuilletons was devoted to the problem of the Jewish diaspora in the new post-war Europe, for which he was criticized and accused that he represents the Jewish messianism of Bolsheviks, Leon Trotsky and Béla Kun. In the eve of World War II, Stern changed his surname to Globnik and moved to Italy where he died in 1961."

  "text" : "Dr. Ian Spry is a retired Melbourne Queen's Counsel, perhaps best known for featuring as a litigant in the High Court decision of Kennon v Spry [2008] HCA 56. This was a landmark case that Spry lost to his ex-wife in a dispute involving family trusts. Following this event, some controversial letters were circulated criticizing the judges who made the decision, in which Spry appeared to accuse them of bias or incompetence (see below). Spry was previously well-known as the author of a highly regarded legal reference book Equitable Remedies (Thompson Reuters, 9th edition, 2013). Sir Owen Dixon, former Chief Justice, described it as \"the best legal book to have come out of Australia.\" It is a more opinionated book than one usually finds in law, in which Spry makes some pointed criticisms of the famous equity judges of the past. He is the son of Brigadier Sir Charles Chambers Fowell Spry, CBE, DSO (26 June 1910 – 28 May 1994) who, from 1950 to 1970, was the second Director-General of Security, the head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO)."

  "text" : "Raden Inoe Perbatasari (before 1929–1954) was an Indonesian politician turned film director and actor. Perbatasari, who had a background in journalism and had previously led the dailies Oetoesan Indonesia and Bintang Timoer, was politically active in the late 1920s as a member of the Indonesian National Party (Partai Nasional Indonesia), a native political party in the Dutch East Indies. By the 1930s, he was active in the Bolero touring troupe, under Andjar Asmara. When Andjar went to Java Industrial Film to become a director for The Teng Chun, Perbatasari was one of several Bolero members to join. They appeared in their first production, Kartinah, in 1940. The film, which followed the love between a nurse and her superior, featured Perbatasari as Ratna Asmara's character's uncle. The following year saw Perbatasari active in three films. Aside from a minor role in Ratna Moetoe Manikam, he made his directorial debut with Elang Darat, which was published by JIF's subsidiary Jacatra Pictures. Elang Darat was a detective story which followed an inspector named Parlan in his investigation of a bandit known only as \"Elang Darat\". Perbatasari's second film, Poetri Rimba (Jungle Princess), followed a hunter as he attempted to escape from bandits. After the Empire of Japan occupied the Indies beginning in 1942, Perbatasari collaborated with the Japanese forces in making the propaganda film Hoedjan for the studio Nippon Eigasha. He also worked at the Japanese-led Cultural Centre in Jakarta. Perbatasari is recorded as working on three films after Indonesia was formally recognised in 1949. The first, Djiwa Pemuda, was released in 1951. The screenplay, Perbatasari's only contribution to the film, followed two former guerrillas from the National Revolution feuding over a woman's love. This was followed by two directorial works: Sekuntum Bunga Ditepi Danau (A Bouquet of Flowers on the Lake Shore; 1952) and Kembali ke Masjarakat (Return to the People; 1954), both of which dealt with the revolution. Perbatasari died at Cikini Hospital in Jakarta on 18 October 1954. He did most of his post-revolution work with the National Film Company (Perusahaan Film Nasional), working in management."

She was the daughter of the Genuese noble Carlo Fieschi, count of Savignone, and the niece of Pope Adrian V. The marriage was arranged as an alliance between Genoa and Milan and the ceremony took place in Milan in 1331. Isabella was known for her beauty and her love life, and reportedly had several lovers. In 1347, she made an official visit to Venice. During her visit, she participated in an orgy during which she had sexual intercourse with three men at the same time, among them being Andrea Dandolo, the Doge of Venice, and the nephew of her spouse, Galeazzo II Visconti. When her husband eventually found out about this, he swore to punish her cruelly. When he died shortly thereafter, he was rumoured to have been poisoned by Isabella in self-defence. After the death of Visconti, Isabella was forced to give up her son's rights to power in Milan and was placed under house arrest. In 1356, Isabella managed to escape from Milan. Reportedly, she returned to her family in Savignone."

His novel The Fragmented Life of Don Jacobo Lerner, was chosen by the National Yiddish Book Center as, \"one of the 100 greatest Jewish Books of the last 150 years.\"  The book tells the story of the life of Jacobo Lerner, a Jewish merchant, who immigrates to Peru from Eastern Europe. Jacobo has an illegitimate son, Efraín, by a Christian woman who he later abandons and thus never knows his son. Jacobo ultimately fails to achieve his goal of creating a traditional Jewish family before he dies, having been rejected by the respectable Miriam Abramowitz. Thematically, the novel presents an examination of Jewish identity and anti-Semitism. The book is divided into chapters which consist of vignettes written in the voices of the characters and an omnipotent narrator, as well as \"Crónicas\", and excerpts from Alma Hebrea, a publication of the Jewish community in the novel, which features writings by the characters"

  "text" : "Ilkka Juhani Vartiovaara (February 14, 1946 Helsinki – April 10, 2010 Vantaa) was a Finnish medical doctor, author, editor, artist and columnist. He specialized in psychiatry, but never worked as a psychiatrist, because he was more keen on being a writer. He served as the editor in chief of Medisiinari, Suomen Lääkärilehti (Finnish Medical Journal) and Terveys 2000. He also illustrated these publications with his drawings. Vartiovaara authored more than 20 books, including both medical textbooks and collections of his magazine columns and essays discussing medicine from a more humanistic perspective. Several of these titles were about stress and burnout, a concept he is credited for originally bringing to Finland in 1984. In 1987 Vartiovaara got infected with Lyme disease on a conference trip to Vancouver. The illness wasn't known in Finland at the time and it took some time for him to acquire a diagnosis. Dsspite attempts at antibiotic treatment the late-stage Lyme disease eventually incapacitated him and he had to go on disability, though he continued writing, drawing and photographing. He was the first well-known Lyme patient in Finland. Vartiovaara wrote about his battle with Lyme in his book Delfiinin laulu (The song of the dolphin) and in a letter published in The Lancet. Vartiovaara died of his Lyme disease in 2010, at the age of 64."

  "text" : "Irene von Meyendorff (6 June 1916 – 28 September 2001) was a German actress. Irene von Meyendorff was of Baltic German origin, born in 1916 in Tallinn (then Reval), Estonia as the eldest child of a German-Baltic aristocrat. Her birth name and title was Baroness Irene Isabella Margarete Pauline Caecila von Meyendorff. In the early 1930s she came to Berlin to work as a cutter in the UFA film studios of Babelsberg. Her beauty soon landed her first film roles and the attention of Joseph Goebbels. Representing the purest ideal of Aryan beauty, the actress portrayed mostly noble patricians. The sale of her promotional post cards shows that she was the number one pin-up girl among the German Army during WWII. She was cast by propaganda director Veit Harlan twice: in 1944 in Opfergang and in 1945 in Kolberg. The production of these elaborately produced color films was strictly supervised by Goebbels; Kolberg was the most expensive film ever produced in Germany (with the budget of 8.5 million Reichsmarks), produced to celebrate the 12th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's ascend to power, opening on 30 January 1945. In 1961 she met British actor James Robertson Justice, fell in love with him and left her third husband Pit Severin, a journalist from Hamburg, to follow Justice to England. She all but gave up acting, returning only briefly in such films as the costume drama Mayerling (1968)."

  "text" : "Abu'l-Saqr Isma'il ibn Bulbul (844/845–891) was a prominent official of the Abbasid Caliphate during the reign of al-Mu'tamid (r. 870–892), serving as vizier of the Caliphate from 878 to 892. Although he claimed membership of the Arab Banu Shayban tribe, he was of Persian or Mesopotamian origin. He rose through the ranks of the Abbasid bureaucracy, becoming head of the diwan of the royal domains, and was appointed to the highest civil office, that of vizier, by the regent al-Muwaffaq in 878. He was deposed soon after, but was reinstated within a year. Nevertheless, real power in the government resided with al-Muwaffaq's own secretary, Sa'id ibn Makhlad, and it was not until the latter's downfall in 885 that Isma'il truly became head of the administration. He enjoyed wide-ranging authority which extended even to the military. It was he that, facing chronic financial shortages, recruited two merchant brothers, Ahmad ibn al-Furat and his brother Ali, who became central figures within the caliphal administration over the next few decades. Isma'il ibn Bulbul had Shi'ite sympathies, and a determined enemy in al-Muwaffaq's son, the future Caliph al-Mu'tadid (r. 892–902), whose growing political and military power he tried unsuccessfully to neutralize. Consequently, when al-Muwaffaq died in June 891 and was succeeded as regent by al-Mu'tadid, Isma'il was arrested and died shortly after."
