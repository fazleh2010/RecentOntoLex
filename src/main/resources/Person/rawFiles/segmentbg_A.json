Arthur MacNalty was also a ground breaking medical scientist. In early career in 1908, he teamed with the Welshman Thomas Lewis (cardiologist) to demonstrate that tracings from then nascent electrocardiography (ECG) could be used as a tool for diagnosing Heart block. This use of electrocardiography to diagnose heart block was the earliest application of ECG technology in cardiology and clinical medicine. He was a pioneer in the modern discipline of public health and in the specialty of preventive medicine. In the 1930s, MacNalty became among the earliest public health authorities, if not the earliest such authority, to publicly warn against the serious medical dangers of fad dieting, or, as it was then known “slimming”, and anti-obesity medications. He was particularly concerned with the neurological side effects of the then popular practice of dosing with thyroid extract to lose weight. MacNalty was too a prolific author of acclaimed and still relevant medical and other histories. He is the author of a total 96 books in the fields of medicine and / or history in 154 publications in 3 languages and which are held in at least 2700 known library collections."

  "text" : "Augustus Henry Fox (c. 1822–1895) was a painter who exhibited three works at the Royal Academy. Although Fox exhibited at the Royal Academy, little else seems to have been recorded about him until 2010, when an oil painting signed \"A. H. Fox\", depicting an unidentified bearded man in civilian dress, which had been found discarded in a waste skip, was put up for sale on the BBC television programme Flog It!. Although the canvas was described as being in good condition (the frame was damaged), it was auctioned for only £40. Other works by Fox have been sold at some of the most prestigious auction houses, including Bonhams. Among his sitters were Francis Aspinal Philips, who was High Sheriff of Radnorshire in 1851, Philips' wife Jane, Sir Edward Watkin, 1st Baronet, MP and various members of the Rymer family, notably Thomas Rymer of Calder Abbey and the Dutton Estate Ribchester (Rymer purchased Calder Abbey for £44,200 in 1885, eleven years after the portrait) and Thomas Harrison Rymer, Esq. (1874), a commissioning agent and later a Justice of the Peace, who inherited the estate on Thomas Rymer's death (1902) (Farrer W. & Brownbill J. 1912. A History of the County of Lancaster. Volume 7 pp. 45–51). T H Rymer would hold the seat at Calder Abbey, Cumberland as well as another at Letton Lodge, Broughton Park, Manchester and would become High Sheriff of Cumberland in 1910 until his death on 13 April 1911. Fox's work shows T H Rymer as a young, distinguished man seated upright at a desk with documents. It is unusual in the context of much of Fox's portraiture work in that it shows the sitter in profile, focusing on the youthful distinction of the subject's face and surrounded by an aura."

He sculpted a number of monuments around his home province and in the Lazio. Laurenti was prolific in the production of portraits and monuments. At Turin, in 1880, he displayed busts of an Arab, and of a prophet (Augur) and a Roman senator (awarded a prize). In 1888 in Rome, he displayed Nero; Le smorfie dei satiri, e Una partita a palline sulle rive del Tevere. He sculpted a bust of Domenico Fernelli (1905) in bronze, located in the Giardini Nuvolari of Mantua. In 1911 he completed the frieze il Corteo della Vita e del Lavoro on the right side of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome for architect Cesare Bazzani. Among his public works, are a fountain and Monument to Fallen (Caduti) (1926) in the Piazza Borghese; a Garibaldini (1883) in Piazza Porzio Catone; a monument to Silvio Spaventa (1899) located in Bomba, in province of Chieti; and finally a moument to the fallen in Piazzale Belvedre of Rocca Priora."

  "text" : "Ambrogio Raffaele or Raffele (1845-1928) was an Italian painter. He was born in Vigevano. He studied under Antonio Fontanesi and Andrea Gastaldi at the Accademia Albertina in Turin, and was a colleague of Marco Calderini. He moved back to Vigevano late in life. He painted both genre and landscapes, in oil and water-color. In 1880 at Turin, he exhibited: Bacia, sole immortale, bacia il tuo figlio. At Milan, in 1881, he had a landscape depicting Un tramonto di sole, and at Rome, in 1833, Lettrice distratta. Among his other works were La finestra dirimpetto; Piazza Pia a Roma; Al Colosseo; and Sera; Rome fuori Porta San Paolo and Passeggiata in montagna were watercolors displayed at the 1887 Exhibition in Venice. Singer Sargent painted a portrait of the artist with his painter's kit and chair, sitting atop a hillside in front of an alpine landscape. This undescores Raffaele's technique to paint his landscapes outdoors."

  "text" : "Albert A. Seedman, (August 9, 1918 – May 17, 2013), was an officer with the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for 30 years. At the end of his career he was the department's chief of detectives, the only Jewish officer to ever hold that position. After his retirement he was the chief of security for a New York area department store chain before retiring to South Florida. Seedman established himself as a detective during the 1960s. As the detective commander for Brooklyn, he once oversaw an investigation of a shooting death, in which over 2,000 people were interviewed, that turned out to have been a freak accident. He investigated many prominent crimes during that era, including the Borough Park Tobacco robbery and the Kitty Genovese murder. As the chief of detective he reformed that branch by assigning detectives to specialize in certain areas of crime rather than just investigating whatever cases came their way when they were on shift. His tenure as chief of detectives of the city was short but memorable, marked by the Knapp Commission's corruption investigations which briefly cost him his job, several mob hits and terror attacks carried out by the Black Liberation Army (BLA). When his superior officers hindered his investigation into the murder of an officer at a Harlem mosque out of fear of a race riot, Seedman resigned his position and retired from the force, although he did not say that had been the reason for another 40 years. Frequently and accurately described as \"cigar-chomping\" and \"tough-talking\", with a personal style likened by a colleague to a Jewish gangster, he was one of the city's most visible police personnel during the turbulent 1960s and early 1970s. Newspaper photographers and television cameras carried many images of, and quotes by, him. He was always willing to speak to reporters even if he could not tell them much. After his retirement he wrote Chief!, a memoir of his time on the force and high-profile cases, and appeared as a detective in the 1975 film Report to the Commissioner."

Toriello is a former showman, and a Franciscan Friar with the religious name of Friar Emanuel, who in late 1996 exposed Catholic priests as paedophiles, marking the start of his social activism, although since his youth he has always been involved in volunteering activities. Toriello’s eclectic and active personality, expressed by being involved in too many activities and doing too many things at the same time, in an unconventional way, often manifested itself in a plenitude of ideas and blurring of focus. The resulting ambiguities and controversies associated with him led to his being regarded as a “controversial person”."

His early genre paintings of Venetian scenes were followed by a number of religious and history paintings, among them Tiziano istruisce Irene di Spilimbergo (\"Titian teaching Irene of Spilimberg\"). He returned to genre painting, and produced many scenes of Venetian life, often featuring children. One of the best-known of these was Il Ciabattino, \"the cobbler\". Many of his works were sold abroad. In 1891 he exhibited in Berlin. Rotta was married to a daughter of Lattanzio Querena; they had a son, the painter Silvio Giulio Rotta. Rotta died in Venice on 10 or 11 September 1903."

  "text" : "Antoine B. Beauvilliers (1754 – 31 January 1817) was a pioneering restaurateur who opened the first prominent grand restaurant in Paris. Moreover, he wrote L'Art du Cuisinier. Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin considers him the most important of the early restaurateurs, as \"he was the first to have an elegant dining room, handsome well-trained waiters, a fine cellar and a superior kitchen.\" Beauvilliers is described as a \"portly figure, his triple chin, his broad, joyous face, and the light that sparkles in his large grey eye.\" He dressed fashionably and carried a sword. His success was enhanced by his ability to \"cater to and flatter rich patrons\", attending to them personally and helping them with items on the menu; he had a prodigious memory and could recall a patron he had not seen in 20 years."

Soon thereafter Cornelius Jacobsen May arrived with the ship Nieu Netherlandt. at Nut Island in the Upper New York Bay. Passengers were dispersed to settlements at Kievet's Hook on the Connecticut River, Fort Wilhelmus on the Delaware River, and the first permanent Dutch settlement in North America, Fort Orange at present day Albany, New York. According to John Romeyn Brodhead, Cornelius Jacobsen May was appointed as the first Director of the colony, with Adrian Joris as second in command. May hastened south to oversee construction of Fort Nassau on the South River to forestall French incursions. Tienpont was left in command of Fort Orange and was called its 'governor' in dispositions of an early settler taken in 1685 and 1688. He acted as deputy for Director of New Netherland Willem Verhulst. Tienpoint negotiated covenants with Native American (Seneca, Cayugas, Iroquois, Oneidas, Onondagas, and Mohawks) in the Hudson Valley that were instrumental in establishing the Dutch fur trade, mostly in beaver pelts, in North America. Tienpont skippered the Meeuwken which arrived in port in May 1626. Aboard was Peter Minuit, the new director of the nascent colony. In 1637, Tienpont captained the ship Fågel Grip as part of the first expedition from Sweden to the Delaware Valley led by Minuit."

His period of office was marked by Umar's piety-driven reforms, aimed at supporting the Muslims and spreading Islamization across the Caliphate: although the privileges of the Christian Church and the monasteries were confirmed, Christian village headsmen were replaced by Muslims, the sale of wine was prohibited, the jizya became universally enforced, and the pressure to convert to Islam increased."

When Qurra died in office in 715, he was promoted in his stead, the first governor chosen from the local Arabs after several decades where the post had been filled by various grandees of the Umayyad family and their court. His period of office was a continuation of Qurra's, and according to the Coptic sources was marked by increasing fiscal oppression, combined with the efforts of the government to clamp down on avoidance of taxation and corvée labour. This included such measures as restricting their ability to travel through the issue of passports, which greatly impeded trade in the province."

  "text" : "Alceste Campriani (February 11, 1848 – 1933) was an Italian painter. He was born in Terni from a noble family. His father's political attachment to the cause of Italy prompted his arrest by Papal officers. This led to economic difficulties for the Campriani family. He was enrolled in the Naples Institute of Fine arts, but he proved recalcitrant to academic discipline, and abandoned the institute to paint on his own. After a few years of near destitution, he was about to abandon an artistic career altogether, when he garnered a prize for composition awarded by the Institute. He befriended Giuseppe De Nittis, who introduced him to the Goupil Gallery, who went on to market over one hundred of his works to England, France, Belgium, and the Americas. His paintings mixed genre and landscape, focusing on the traditions and countryside of Campania. Like Palizzi, he often painted children and animals in pastoral pursuits. At the 1880 Exhibition in Turin, he exhibited Il Ritorno dal Santuario di Montevergine, which gained him much praise. Among his other works are Il ritorno dal mercato, Tra Foggia e Manfredonia, Il mercato dei cavalli, La partita a bocce, Caccia con la civetta, Spiaggia delle Sirene, Il venditore di polli, I bagnanti a Napoli, Colloquio, Jardin d'acclimation, Autunno sul Vesuvio exhibited in Florence in 1896, Ritorno dal pascolo exhibited in Turin in 1898, Scirocco sull costiera d'Amalfi, Tramonto in Danimarca, Pastorale, Mattino exhibited in Milan in 1898, and Primavera exhibited in Rome in 1895. Campriani died in 1933 in Lucca."

  "text" : "Amerigo Bartoli Natinguerra (Terni, 1890 - Rome, 1971) was an Italian painter, caricaturist, and writer. He mainly painted vedute and landscapes, using both oil and water color in subdued earthy tones. He also painted still lifes and portraits. Amerigo as a young man moved to Rome, where he became a pupil of Duilio Cambellotti and Giulio Aristide Sartorio. He displayed works at the 1915 Mostra della Secessione in Rome, and in 1921, at the Biennale di Roma. In 1922, he joined the gruppo di Valori Plastici, and painted compositions or great simplicity and warm colors, including Gli amici al caffè, which won an award at the 1930 Biennale of Venice. In 1927, Margherita Sarfatti presented his work at the Exhibition of Dieci artisti del Novecento Italiano, during the 93rd Exposition of Amatori e Cultori di Belle arti. Amerigo was an avid contributor of both columns and cartoons to publications such as \"LaTribuna\", \"La Lettura\", \"Gazzetta del Popolo\", \"Quadrivio\", \"Omnibus\", and \"La Fiera Letteraria\". From 1938 to 1960, he held a professorship of painting at the Academy of Fine Arts of Rome."

His acting career began with the New Irish Players in Killarney. He starred in many TV shows such as Ballykissangel and also starred alongside many internationally recognised film stars in many big Hollywood productions as well as independent productions and on stage in his beloved theatre. He is best known for his roles in Chekhov's The Seagull and Eugene O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten. He won an Olivier Award for his role in the latter. Alan was loved by everybody who knew him and was always a humble honest and funny gentleman, whether he was talking to Hollywood royalty or a street drinker. He understood & enjoyed talking to both but always had time and a kind word for the latter (who to many people are invisible or to be avoided) as Alan himself had bravely battled with alcoholism for many years, having experienced homelessness at his most difficult time. He died suddenly at his home in Dalkey, Dublin on 13 May 2011, but thanks to his incredible list of film credits (details to follow) he will never be forgotten."

Born in  Swansea, Wales, Syed earned her Bachelors in Fine Arts from University of East London in 1987 and a Postgraduate degree in Mixed Media from Slade School of Fine Art in 1992. Over the past two decades, she has taught and lectured at Central St. Martins and Chelsea College of Art and Design, and she is now an associate lecturer at Southampton Solent University. Syed’s work has been screened and exhibited in museums, galleries, and festivals worldwide, including at the  Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles,  Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid, Institute of International Visual Arts (inIVA) in London, and the Talwar Gallery, which has represented her for over a decade, in New York and in New Delhi. Syed lives and works in London, UK. Syed’s work focuses on issues of identity, representation, and language, often incorporating sound and text, in addition to images and characters, to explore and question structures of personal and collective narrative. Commenting on her own work, Syed has said, “I am interested in language; we construct ourselves through language; it creates the space where we define ourselves. Film can be a mirror—it can throw things back at us in a way that makes us question the ideas we have about ourselves and through this each other…I [am] interested in what happens when you hold more than one ‘culture’ within you at any given time.”"

Arthur Wait was a local builder who joined the board of Crystal Palace as a director sometime between 1948 and 1950. In 1958 he became the Chairman, before being replaced by Raymond Bloye in 1972, and becoming Life President, a position he held until 1981. The Arthur Wait Stand at Selhurst Park is named in his honour. Wait was a lifelong Palace supporter who used to sneak into the ground as a schoolboy. As chairman of the club, he was instrumental in Palace hosting Real Madrid's first game in London. To celebrate the installation of new floodlights at the club, Wait and the board wanted to invite a famous club from the north of England to play a friendly. After discovering the fee demanded, Wait declared: \"If that's what they are going to do to us, we might as well try to get Real Madrid.\" Wait secured the services of Madrid for a fee of £10,000 and expenses. On the evening of 18 April 1962, the Spanish Ambassador switched on the floodlights and Madrid secured a first half lead of 3-1 and then held on to win 4-3."

  "text" : "Arthur Moyse (21 June 1914 – 22 February 2003) was an Anglo-Irish anarchist, artist and writer. He was born in County Wexford and moved to West London in his youth to Shepherd's Bush where he continued to live until his death. In his youth he was actively involved in political activity including the battle of Cable Street in 1936. He also saw active service in World War Two, including the airborne landings at Arnhem in 1944, but he was court-martialled twice for insubordination. As well as being something of a self-publisher, particularly with his attachment to London bohemia life and producing the ZeroOne magazine, he is most commonly known as an art critic and cartoonist. His outpourings would contribute to Freedom, Anarchy and The Raven: Anarchist Quarterly amongst others from the late 1960s to the early 1980s."

Hagg became interested in boat building and in early 1937 he resigned his position as director and chief designer at de Havilland to set up the Walton Yacht Works. In November of that year he also became a consultant with D Napier and Son, Ltd., carrying out the preliminary design work on the Napier-Heston Racer, a wooden aircraft powered by a 2,450 horsepower (1,830 kW) Napier Sabre engine and designed to break the world airspeed record. In January 1943 he joined Airspeed Ltd. as technical director and was responsible for the Airspeed Ambassador (BEA Elizabethan). He retired in 1947."

  "text" : "Abul Kalam Azad (born 24 September 1964) is a noted contemporary Indian photographer. Abul's photographic works are predominantly autobiographical and expose the areas of politics, culture, contemporary history, gender and eroticism. His works attempts a re-reading of contemporary Indian history - the history in which ordinary people are absent and mainly provided by beautiful images and icons. Abul's works makes an active intervention in the common illustrative discourse of this history. Using the same tool, photography, that chisels history out of a block of ‘real’ human experiences, Abul makes a parody of it. 'Overall, the corpus of Azad’s work can be seen to have a thrust towards an archive of local micro-history at the level of personal memory and in that sense, his works add up to a kind of social anthropology of his land and its people, though not necessarily in the line of tradition of the objective documentary'. Abul Kalam Azad is the visionary behind EtP Ekalokam Trust for Photography, a Trust dedicated to preserving and promoting contemporary Photography. He is also the Director of Project 365, a public photo art project that collectively creates and preserves photographic visuals of the fast changing culture and lifestyle of ancient Tamilakam."

In 1973, he was instrumental in organising the miners' strike that toppled Edward Heath's Conservative government in March 1974. A decade later, he led the union through the 1984–85 miners' strike, a key event in British labour and political history. It was a confrontation with the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, and the miners' union was decisively defeated. A former Labour Party member, he is now the leader of the Socialist Labour Party (SLP), which he founded in 1996."

  "text" : "Alejandro \"Alex\" Kacelnik FRS (born 14 December 1946) is an Argentine-British zoologist and professor of behavioural ecology at Oxford University. Kacelnik heads the Behavioural Ecology Research Group at Oxford. The author of nearly 200 peer reviewed publications, his research focuses on the evolution of behaviour and mathematical modelling. His work uses an interdisciplinary approach, combining data and methods from zoology, psychology and economic theory. In 2011 Kacelnik was honoured by the Comparative Cognition Society for his contributions to the field of animal cognition. He has also received the Cogito Prize for interdisciplinary research linking the natural and social sciences, the de Robertis Medal of the Argentinian Society of Neurosciences, and the Raíces (\"Roots\") Prize for contributions to international collaborations between Argentinian and other scientists. Kacelnik is best known for his research on tool-making and tool-use in New Caledonian crows. However, his research has involved many other species of animals, especially starlings and cowbirds, and he has made many contributions to optimal foraging theory, mechanisms of animal decision making, and brood parasitism."

In 2000, he co-founded dotlit: The Online Journal of Creative Writing After a brief period studying physics in his native Germany, Bruns’ research focus changed to Media and Cultural studies. He completed a PhD at the University of Queensland in 2002 that analysed the emerging Website genre of Resource Centre Sites such as indymedia and Slashdot. Bruns found that ‘Resource Centre Site produsers engage in an adaptation of both traditional journalistic gatekeeping methodologies and librarianly resource collection approaches to the Web environment: in the absence of gates to keep online, they have become 'gatewatchers', observing the publication of news and information in other sources and publicising its existence through their own sites.’ His findings in this formulative thesis have spurred much of his further research into the online media field, including two of his key concepts, Produsage and Gatewatching.Bruns is an expert on the impact of user-led content creation in the fields of produsers and produsage, blogging, gatewatching and citizen journalism and learning and teaching in the digital age. 'His current work focuses especially on the study of user participation in social media spaces such as Twitter in the context of acute events.'"

  "text" : "Antoine Le Moiturier (1425–1495) was a French sculptor. Le Moiturier was born in Avignon into a family of sculptors. His uncle was the itinerant French master Jacques Morel. Following from the work of Jean de la Huerta beginning in 1443, Le Moiturier completed a group of sculptures of grieving monks known as the Mourners of Dijon. Completed in 1470, these sculptures are in the architectural frieze on the tombs of Duke John the Fearless and Margaret of Bavaria. They reside at the Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy in Dijon. The job had originally been assigned to the workshop of Claus Sluter, but went to Le Moiturier and De la Huerta. In 1461, le Moiturier was hired by Canon Jacques Oboli to create an altarpiece for St Pierre, Avignon. Oboli died before the work could be completed, and in 1463 the church commissioned an altarpiece depicting the Last Judgement. le Moiturier completed this two years later. This stellar work included statues of Jesus, Saint Peter and Paul, and several angels. Today, only two sculptures remain of the more than sixteen that were originally in the sculpture. Le Moiturier is also believed to have made the pleurants (mourners) on the tomb of Philippe Pot (1477–83)."

In 1868 she took up hospital visiting and parish work in Bath, and through beginning a correspondence with a seaman who asked her to write to him, developed into the devoted friend of sailors, superintendent of the Royal Naval Temperance Society and co-founder (with Sophia Wintz) of the Royal Sailors' Rests, or clubs for sailors, at Devonport and Portsmouth. She published Life Among the Bluejackets in 1909. In June 1918 her work for the Royal Navy was publicly recognised when she was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE). On her death in Devonport she became the first woman ever given a full ceremonial Royal Navy funeral.

  "text" : "Arthur Wallace Calhoun (1885–1979) was a scholar, author, and professor at a wide variety of American colleges. He is well known for his published works and his teachings in worker's education. Calhoun was born January 29, 1885 in Dayton, Pennsylvania. His father was a physician. Calhoun began his education at the University of Pittsburgh where he received his B.A. in 1906. Calhoun later married Mildred Tourtellot in 1916, with whom he fathered two sons. His first son was born in 1917 and later became Dr. Donald Wallace Calhoun, a sociologist. In 1921, Calhoun had his second son, Dr. Robert Allan Calhoun, who practiced as a health specialist and social worker. Calhoun died in 1978 at the age of 93. Calhoun was a well-educated man and highly regarded for his teachings in workers education. Following his graduation at the University of Pittsburgh, Calhoun received his MA from the University of Wisconsin in 1913 and his PhD from Clark University in 1916. Calhoun then completed additional graduate work at Columbia University. Calhoun taught at many American colleges over his career as a professor. He began as the professor of English and Philosophy at New Windsor College in New Windsor, Maryland from 1906 to 1907. Calhoun then taught Latin and History at St. Petersburg High School in St. Petersburg, Florida from 1907 to 1909; German and History at Florida State College for Women (now Florida State University) from 1910 to 1911; Social Science at Lenox College in Hopkinton, Iowa from 1912 to 1913 and at Maryville College in Maryville, Tennessee from 1913 to 1915. Calhoun then returned to Clark University to become a Fellow in Sociology and received his doctorate and became Assistant Professor of Economics from 1916 to 1918. Calhoun held socially radical opinions and very rarely held a position for long. Therefore, he moved from place to place including, Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Kentucky from 1918 to 1919; Teacher of Cooperative at the Rand School of Social Science in New York City from 1920 to 1921; Professor of Economics at Grove City College in Grove City, Pennsylvania from 1921 to 1922; Teacher of Latin and Spanish, Orlando, Fl., Jr. High School, 1922–23; Teacher of Social Science at Brookwood Labor College in Katonah, New York, 1923–29; Professor of History at Limestone College in Gaffney, South Carolina frm 1929 to 1932; Professor of German and Greek, Erskine College in Due West, South Carolina, 1933–36, Dean of Sterling College, 1936–55; Professor of Sociology at Illinois College in Jacksonville, Illinois from 1957 to 58; and Professor of Social Science, Claflin University in Orangeburg, South Carolina in 1958. Calhoun is most famous for his years in workers education at Brookwood Labor College in N.Y. where he taught many about American Labor Issues. Calhoun was also the author of many published books. His most famous works included: Social History of the American Family, three volumes, 1916-1919; The Worker Looks at Government, 1927; The Social Universe, 1932; Social Regeneration, 1945; and The Cultural Concept of Christianity. He also wrote many short books and contributed to others such as American Labor Dynamics, 1928; The New Generation, 1930; Behold America, 1931; and The Early American Family, 1932. Along with his books, Calhoun wrote many articles and short published works that can be found in the Arthur. W. Calhoun Collection of the Walter P. Reuther Library at Wayne State University. Calhoun held many positions in his life as an author and professor of multiple fields. His pacifist beliefs and socially radical opinions caused for much scrutiny but also allowed him to educate a wide variety of students."

Agnolo degli Erri, along with his brothers Bartolomeo and Bartolomeo Bonascia, are considered key figures of the Quattrocento movement in Modena. He likely painted the triptych of the Coronation of the Virgin at the Galleria Estense (1462 and 1466). It is likely that his brother was also involved in this work. The art historian Roberto Longhi also assigns a secondary interest to a series of paintings of scenes from the lives of the saints. An altarpiece dedicated to Saint Peter, from the church of San Domenico in Modena, today the Galleria nazionale di Parma, has also been attributed to Agnolo degli Erri."

  "text" : "Allen Richard Derr (April 5, 1928 – June 10, 2013) was an American lawyer who won Reed v. Reed, a landmark United States Supreme Court decision issued in 1971 who strengthened anti-discrimination protections for women. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously for Derr's client, Sally Reed, who sued her estranged husband, Cecil, over who should administer the estate of their late son following his suicide. Derr argued before the Court that the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution forbid discrimination on the basis of gender. On November 22, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor Derr's client, Sally Reed, in a decision written by Chief Justice Warren Burger. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, Derr was the son of Idaho politicians. His father, Alfred M. Derr, served in the Idaho Senate. His mother, Hattie Derr, became Idaho's first female state Senator in 1937 when she was appointed to the Idaho Senate to fill in for her husband, who was suffering from appendicitis. He was raised in northern Idaho. Allen Derr worked as a state legislative page in 1941. He graduated from Clark Fork High School in Clark Fork, Idaho, in 1947. Derr earned both his bachelor's degree and law degree from the University of Idaho. He ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Idaho Legislature during the 1960s. Derr later co-founded the Idaho Press Club and served on its board of directors. A resident of Boise, he continued to practice law until shortly before his death. Allen Derr died from leukemia in Boise, Idaho, on June 10, 2013, at the age of 85. He was survived by his second wife, former Ada County Commissioner Judy Peavey-Derr. His first wife, Helen Derr, preceded him in death."

His mother was a cousin of Robert Burns, the Scottish national poet and the aunt of Sir Hugh Allan. He was educated at local schools in Riccarton. He moved to Montreal, in 1846, and was apprenticed into the printing business. The latter half of his apprenticeship was served at the Montreal Herald. In 1853, in partnership with two others, he established a new newspaper, the Montreal Sun. Later that year, the three founded a general printing company, Moore, Owler and Stevenson, and Stevenson remained active in that business until merging it with the Montreal Printing Company in 1879."

  "text" : "Alfred L. Wilds (Mar. 1 1915 - July 4, 2002) was a professor emeritus of chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. His doctoral research was done under the guidance of Professor Werner E. Bachman atMichigan at a time (mid thirties) when modern organic chemistry and synthesis was just starting toemerge. His thesis work is hailed even today as a major andrevolutionary break with the past. The total synthesis of the steroidalsex hormone Equilenin, published in the Journal of the AmericanChemical Society in 1940, was the first successful total synthesis of acomplex natural product. In the context of the time, it was not a widely disseminated view that chemical structures of this degree of structural and stereochemical complexity could indeed be made from common starting chemicals. The Vitalism theory still distorted many people's views as to the relationship between \"ordinary\" chemicals and such esoterica as animal-isolated sex hormones. So the \"Bachmann, Cole and Wilds\" paper is widely recognized as inaugurating the modern era of chemical synthesis of complex medicinally important structures. 70+ years later, synthesis of such complex targets as HIV protease inhibitors are as a result of the Equilenin synthesis by Al Wilds."

Rykov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1898, and after it split into Bolshevik and Menshevik factions in 1903, he joined the Bolsheviks—led by Vladimir Lenin. He played an active part in the 1905 Russian Revolution. Months prior to the October Revolution of 1917, he became a member of the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets, and was elected to the Bolshevik Party Central Committee in July–August of the same year, during the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party. Rykov, a moderate, often came into political conflict with Lenin and more radical Bolsheviks, but nonetheless proved influential when the October Revolution finally did overthrow the Russian Provisional Government, and as such served many roles in the new government, starting October–November (old style) as People's Commissar for Internal Affairs on the first roster of the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom), which was chaired by Lenin. During the Russian Civil War (1918–20), Rykov oversaw the implementation of the \"War Communism\" economic policy, and helped oversee the distribution of food to the Red Army and Navy. After Lenin was incapacitated by his third stroke in March 1923 Rykov—along with Lev Kamenev—was elected by the Sovnarkom to serve as Deputy Chairman to Lenin. While both Rykov and Kamenev were Lenin's deputies, Kamenev was the acting Premier of the Soviet Union. Lenin died from a fourth stroke on 21 January 1924 and on 2 February Rykov was chosen by the Council of People's Commissars as Premier of both the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and of the Soviet Union, which he served as until 18 May 1929 and 19 December 1930, respectively. On 21 December 1930 he was removed from the Politburo. From 1931-37 Rykov served as People's Commissar of Communications on the Council he formerly chaired. On 17 February 1937—at a meeting of the Central Committee—he was arrested with Nikolai Bukharin. In March 1938 both were found guilty of treason and executed."

  "text" : "Adrien Barthe (born Grat-Norbert Barthe, June 7, 1828 – August 13, 1898) was a French classical composer. Born in Bayonne, Barthe studied music under Fernand Le Borne at the Paris Conservatory. An early composition, Francesca de Rimini, was lauded by the Rome Institute, and subsequent cantatas Judith and Don Carlos were well received. Performances of Aubade in 1893 by conductor Paul Taffanel were popular with audiences to the extent that Taffanel published praise of Barthe - \"your delightful work earned us our first success.\" Moving from classical composition to theatre work, Barthe's la Fiancée d'Abydos appeared on stage in Paris and Rome starring Jean-Vital Jammes, however flaws in the composition persuaded Barthe to retire shortly after December 1865, becoming a teacher. He died in Asnières, leaving behind several unpublished manuscripts."

  "text" : "Abdullah bin Muhammad al-Ahdal, a native of Saudi Arabia, was the great Imam of Belgium. He died in 1989 in Brussels. On March 29, 1989, while he was rector of the Great Mosque of Brussels, a gunman entered and shot him. The Lebanese terrorist organization Soldiers of the Right claimed credit for the murders  Belgian authorities and the news media linked the killings to The Satanic Verses controversy: the previous month Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had issued a fatwā ordering Muslims to kill novelist Salman Rushdie because of their objections to the publication of his book The Satanic Verses. Al-Ahdal had publicly criticized Rushdie, but had also argued that the fatwā was contrary to Islamic law. Al-Ahdal was killed along with the Tunisian Muslim librarian Salem el-Beher. Doubts persist on this theory because the Imam had received death threats because of his sermons on the possibility of different religions to coexist with Islam, before his rejection of the fatwa. In 2008, the Belgian tabloid Het Laatste Nieuws reported that Abdelkader Belliraj, a Moroccan-Belgian arms smuggler, had murdered Al-Ahdal, el-Beher and Jah al-Rasul, a driver for the Saudi embassy in Brussels. The three victims had reportedly witnessed fraud at the Saudi embassy. All three men were killed with the same 7.65mm handgun. These allegations were not sustained by later investigations by the Belgian police."

As of 2013 Marcel was working at the University of Hertfordshire and Cambridge University where his research focused on consciousness and phenomenological experience."

Dreyfus joined a small textile trading firm set up by three of his elder brothers and moved to Lima, Peru to act as their local representative. He became involved in the guano trade, and in 1869 signed a major contract with the Peruvian government that gave him a monopoly over exports of Peruvian guano to Europe.With this he controlled the largest source of Peruvian national income. The Peruvian government let Dreyfus act as their agent in managing their existing debt and floating new loans used for railway construction. The government ran into increasing financial difficulties. These were compounded by a war with Chile between 1879 and 1883 in which they lost their key guano-producing province. A lengthy series of lawsuits followed between the creditors whose loans were secured by guano deposits and the governments of Peru and Chile. The Dreyfus trading enterprise came to an end. He retired to France, where he owned a chateau in the country and a mansion in Paris that he filled with a major collection of art."

Upon graduation he joined his uncle west on the US Geological Survey through New Mexico, Arizona, and California. He then worked in hydrography in places as far flung as China, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, Panama, and Turkestan. In 1888 he co-founded the National Geographic Society, and in 1907 he was elected president of the Washington Society of Engineers. He served as the Director of the Reclamation Service (now the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation) from 1914 to 1923. Boulder Dam (later called Hoover Dam) was fundamentally the conception of Arthur Powell Davis. A month before he died, Arthur Powell Davis was appointed Consulting Engineer on the dam project. Mr. Davis had his vision back in 1902. He died in Oakland, California, on August 7, 1933, and is buried in St. Paul’s Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C., along with his wife, Elizabeth B. Davis.

  "text" : "Ashley Turton (November 25, 1973 – January 10, 2010) was a lobbyist for Progress Energy who was reportedly \"likely involved with\" the company's merger with Duke Energy. She had been Special Assistant to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, chief of staff for Connecticut representative Rosa DeLauro and before that, aide to Missouri representative Dick Gephardt. She was married to Dan Turton, the Obama administration's liaison to the House of Representatives. They had three children. On the morning of January 10, 2011 she had planned to drive to the airport for an air trip related to her work. Instead, a neighbor telephoned at 4:49 a.m. to report Turton's garage was on fire. Inside the garage, firefighters discovered her body in her 2008 BMW X5 SUV. Her death was investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department with assistance from the city fire department, two BMW engineers, and the ATF. The coroner's report found “acute alcohol intoxication” and said she died from “inhalation of products of combustion and thermal burns”. According to authorities, there was no indication of foul play and there were \"no obvious signs of trauma\"."

  "text" : "Alexander Gustav von Schrenk (4 February 1816 – 25 June 1876) was a Baltic German naturalist born near Tula in what was then the Russian Empire. He was a brother to zoologist Leopold von Schrenck (1826–1894). From 1834 to 1837, he studied sciences at the University of Dorpat (Tartu), later spending several years as an assistant at the botanical garden in St. Petersburg. He was habilitated for mineralogy at Dorpat, where from 1849 he served as a lecturer. From 1858 he spent the next ten years at his wife's manor in Pühajärve (Heiligensee), Livonia, returning to Dorpat in 1868, where he died several years later. Known for his expeditions to Central Asia and northerm Russia, he was the author of Reise nach dem Nordosten des europäischen Rußlands, durch die Tundren der Samojeden, zum arktischen Uralgebirge, a two volume work involving a journey to the Arctic that was later translated into English. While traveling in the historic region of Dzhungaria in Central Asia, he identified numerous new species of plants and insects. Schrenk was co-founder of the Dorpater Naturforschergesellschaft (Tartu Naturalists' Society). The species Picea schrenkiana (Schrenk's spruce) and Tulipa schrenkii (Schrenck's tulip) are named in his honor."

  "text" : "Alexis Granowsky (1890–1937) was a Russian theatre director who later became a film director. Granowsky was born as Abraham Azarkh to a Jewish family in Moscow. After studying in St. Petersburg, he went to Munich where he gained valuable theatre experience working under Max Reinhardt. He served in the Russian army during the First World War before in 1919 he set up his own Jewish-orientated theatre in St. Petersburg, which under a new director became GOSET. Granowsky's reputation rose quickly over the following years, as he became one of the most celebrated theatre directors in Europe. In 1925 Granowsky directed his first film, a silent, but concentrated his efforts on his stage work. After the Russian Revolution, and the Communist victory in the Russian Civil War, Granowsky continued to live in the country even though he felt himself culturally Western European. Granowsky was initially feted by the Soviet authorities and was awarded a number of honours but he began to find their cultural policies increasingly restrictive, and emigrated to the Weimar Republic in the late 1920s. In Germany Granowsky worked on some theatre productions, but increasingly moved into film. He collaborated with a number of other Russian exiles such as Léo Lania who shared his left-wing political views. He directed two German films, before emigrating to Paris where he lived for the rest of his life. He produced and directed expensive prestige films The Adventures of King Pausole (1933) and Taras Bulba (1936). He had married a wealthy German woman, but they separated before his death. Despite his lavish lifestyle, Granowsky died comparatively poor."

After serving in the U.S. Marines, Fagaly returned to Vancouver in the mid-1930s and founded Columbia Photoengraving in order to get the local newspaper, the Vancouver Columbian, to publish his cartoons. He offered to supply the newspaper engraving plates for free if the newspaper would pay him for the cartoons. Since the cost of photoengraving was much more than the going rate for artwork, the newspaper agreed, and Mr. Fagaly became the staff cartoonist for the Columbian. In 1935, he created a comic strip, \"Skip Logan,\" for the Thompson Service in Cincinnati, OH. Fagaly created the daily comic strip There Oughta Be A Law! in 1944 while living in Nantucket, MA."

  "text" : "Dr. Aleksandar Licht (1884−1948) was a Croatian Zionist leader and founder of the Zionist movement in Croatia. Licht was born in village Sokolovac, near Koprivnica to a Croatian Jewish family. As a child he moved with his family to Zagreb. Licht was educated in Zagreb where he finished elementary and high school. He graduated as a lawyer at the Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb. In 1909 he was promoted to a Doctor of law at the University of Zagreb. In 1913 he opened a law firm in Zagreb, but in 1914 he was drafted to a Austro-Hungarian Army. Upon completing military service, Licht returned to Zagreb where he practiced law at his firm. He was the founder and spiritual leader of the Zionism in Croatia. As a young man he was elected chairman of the Jewish youth circle \"Literarni Sastanci\" (Literary Meetings), which soon became a Zionist society. He was also the editor of \"Židovska smotra\" (The Jewish review). In Vienna he was the chairman of \"Bar Giora\", a group of Zionist students from Yugoslavia. After its foundation, in 1909, he was the elected secretary of the \"Zionist federation of South Slavic countries\". In 1919 he was one of the leading Zionists, with Šime Spitzer, who founded the \"Union of the Jewish confessional municipalities in the Kingdom of SHS\" (Savez jevrejskih vjeroispovjednih općina u Kraljevini SHS) in Zagreb. In 1919 Licht also helped to found the \"Zionist federation of Yugoslavia\" (SCJ - Savez cionista Jugoslavije) in Zagreb, where Licht first served as a secretary and later as an elected president. He also befriend with Croatian politician Frano Supilo. Under Licht leadership Zagreb was the strongest Zionist center in the newly founded Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He was also the only Zionist from Yugoslavia lands who was a member of the action committee of the World Zionist Congress. Lich was the founder of the so-called \"Zagreb school\" of Zionism which represented uncompromised and radical Zionism. Under his leadership Croatian Zionists, through the years, raised over 50-60% of total funds collected in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia for the Jewish National Fund. Although he was not a wealthy person, Licht was great philanthropist who often aided various Zagreb, students, sport and charitable societies. Licht was among the financiers who funded the \"Society for building a monument of Tomislav of Croatia\". Licht believed that the major hate toward the Jews in Croatia was spread by the Serbian press in Croatia, and that some Serbs have antisemitism in a depth of their soul. During the 1930s riots in the Mandatory Palestine, Licht always advocated peaceful solution over armed conflict. Licht openly criticized the rising wave of antisemitism in Nazi Germany and Soviet Union during the 1930s. During World War II Licht was arrested by Gestapo with the other notable Zagreb Jews like; Hinko Gotlieb, Lavoslav Šik, Slavko Mayer, Robert Deutsch-Maceljski (of a notable Deutsch-Maceljski family), Branko Alexander (of a notable Alexander family) and others. All of them were taken to Graz, Austria where they were questioned about the Croatian Jewish community. They all were soon released except Mayer who was never seen again. Upon his return to Zagreb, Licht managed to get his identity document back and soon escaped to Slovenia. From Slovenia Licht emigrated to Switzerland through Italy in Autumn, 1943. In Switzerland, at first, he was placed in the refugee camp. With the Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović help, Licht soon found the permanent residence. While in Switzerland Licht actively collected the financial aid for the Zagreb Jewish community which was then transmitted to Zagreb by various channels. Licht died in Montreux, Switzerland on 27 June 1948 as one of the rare Croatian Jews who managed to survive the Holocaust. His body was moved from Switzerland to Land of Israel where he was buried in 1955."

Rudoy has played in Russia for Yenisey-STM Krasnoyarsk, in 2003, RC Novokuznetsk, from 2004 to 2007, and once again for Yenisey-STM Krasnoyarsk, since 2008. He has been a key player for Kazakhstan, since his first game, in 2006. He played in their 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign, that led them to be the second-best team from Asia, reaching a repechage game with Uruguay, lost by 44–7. He also played in their disappointing 2015 Rugby World Cup qualifying, where Kazakhstan was eliminated in the first round, not reaching the final stage of the Asia Cup."

  "text" : "Augusta Marryat (1834? - 1898?) was a British author. The daughter of author Capt. Frederick Marryat and his wife Catherine, she was a children's author and illustrator perhaps best known for the adventure novel Left to Themselves: A Boy's Adventure in Australia (1878), which in later editions had acquired the title The Young Lamberts. The novel is set in Australia, but she is not known to have ever visited the country. Her sisters Florence and Emilia were also authors: Augusta wrote adventure fiction heavily infused with morality in her father's vein, and Florence was a prolific author of sensationalist novels who also acquired a reputation for hanging out with spiritual mediums. A full bibliography of Augusta Marryat is available in The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature: 1800-1900, Vol. 4."

He is also a former member of the Federal Judicial Police in Tamaulipas. Born in the state of Tamaulipas, Cano Flores became a drug trafficker in 2001 while still serving as a police officer. His role in Mexican law enforcement and his ties with the Gulf Cartel allowed him to recruit several other policemen into the criminal organization's ranks. As a high-ranking leader, Cano Flores served as the regional boss of the Gulf Cartel in Los Guerra, a town in the municipality of Ciudad Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas. He was also a leader in Camargo, Tamaulipas, where he coordinated heroin, cocaine, and marijuana shipments to the United States. In 2010 he was named in a U.S. federal indictment with 19 other high-ranking drug lords of La Compañía (The Company), a name used to describe the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas as a conglomerate. He was arrested by the Mexican federal police on June 2009 and extradited to the United States while pending drug trafficking charges on 19 August 2011. Cano Flores was later sentenced to 35 years in prison and ordered to forfeit US$15 billion on 13 May 2013, making him \"highest ranking Gulf Cartel member to be convicted by a U.S. jury in the past 15 years.\""

  "text" : "Alixa Naff (September 15, 1919 – June 1, 2013) was a Lebanese-born American historian. She focused much of her research on the first wave of Arab American immigration to the United States at the turn of the 20th Century. Alixa Naff was born to Faris and Yamna Naff in Rashaya al-Wadi, a village located in present-day Lebanon within the Anti-Lebanon mountains. Her family immigrated to the United States in 1921. They arrived in Spring Valley, Illinois on January 1, 1922, and lived there until moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1929. They moved to Detroit, Michigan in June 1931, where her father worked in the grocery industry. She resided in Falls Church, Virginia, for many years before moving to Mitchellville, Maryland. Naff documented Arab immigration to the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This first wave of mostly Christian immigrants was the first major emigration from the Middle East to the U.S. Naff donated her collection of artifacts and oral histories from early Arab immigrants to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. Naff had driven throughout the nation to collect oral histories and family heirlooms for the collection. She amassed more than 450 oral histories, 2,000 photographs, and more than 500 artifacts. The personal and household objects included kibbe pounder, Middle Eastern musical instruments, and clothing. The Faris and Yamna Naff Collection, which was named in honor of her parents, is available for research through the National Museum of American History. Alixa Naff died from a short illness at her home in Mitchellville, Maryland, on June 1, 2013, at the age of 93."

  "text" : "Alfreda Frances Bikowsky (born 1965) is a career Central Intelligence Agency officer who has headed the Bin Laden Issue Station and the Global Jihad unit. Bikowsky's identity is not publicly acknowledged by the Agency, but was deduced by independent investigative journalists in 2011. In January 2014, the Washington Post named her and tied her to a pre-9/11 intelligence failure and the extraordinary rendition of Khalid El-Masri. The Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture, released in December 2014, showed that Bikowsky was not only a key part of the torture program, but also one of its chief apologists, resulting in the media giving her the moniker \"The Unidentified Queen Of Torture\". Regardless of the fact that Bikowsky was publicly named by many media outlets in connection to illegal torture programs carried out against large numbers of innocent foreign civilians, for reasons unknown the cia ordered various news agencies (including NBC and The New Yorker) to refrain from publishing her name in the senate torture report released in December of 2014. A low level employee, ryan trapani, was quoted as saying that \"We would strongly object to attaching anyone’s name given the current environment,\" and left a voicemail with The Intercept saying “There are crazy people in this world and we are trying to mitigate those threats,\" while refusing to offer a response pertaining to the negative revelations of Bikowsky in the senate torture report, instead attempting to appropriate some measure of value to the attempt by john brennan to characterize the portrayal of the \"value\" of the agency's illegal torture program in the torture report as disputable and erroneous after it was described as \"misrepresented\". Bikowsky married her former boss Michael Scheuer in December 2014."

  "text" : "Andrew Simpson (born 1966/1967) is a Scottish animal trainer who runs the company Instinct for Film with his partner and fellow trainer Sally Jo Sousa. Simpson was born in Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. His parents worked for the aluminum maker Alcan, and he grew up with his family on the company estate in the Highlands. When he was 20 years old, he traveled to Australia and found work as an extra for the 1988 film A Cry in the Dark that starred Meryl Streep. Simpson worked with the film's dingo trainer for three weeks and continued working as an extra and as an animal training assistant. He eventually moved to Vancouver in Canada and worked for Creative Animal Talent. He moved to Calgary in Canada in 1994 and currently lives there on a ranch with Sousa. Their company Instinct for Film has trained \"birds, bears, leopards and small animals\" for films and advertisements. Simpson has trained animals over numerous television shows and over 150 films, including Final Destination (2000), Elf (2003), and Borat (2006). When Simpson and his company were hired to train wolves in Siberia for a French film called Loup (French for \"Wolf\"), the trainer decided to film the training process. Using the footage, he produced the documentary Wolves Unleashed, which screened at several film festivals. His biggest project to date was Wolf Totem (2015), for which he trained wolves."

Following the war he immigrated to the United States and served as an officer in the United States Army, retiring as a colonel. Marttinen was one of the key figures in the Weapons Cache Case where a large number of Finnish Army weapons was hidden around the country in case of a Soviet invasion. Soldiers involved in this case were forced to leave Finland since hiding weapons was a criminal subject due to the 1944 Moscow Armistice. These soldiers who mostly fled to United States and enlisted in the US Army were later called as \"Marttinen's men\". Marttinen first fled to Sweden in 1945 with the help of his former subordinate officer Harry Järv. A year later Marttinen and his family moved to United States. US citizenship was given to Marttinen in 1951. He served in the US Army from 1947 to 1968, first as a specialist and trainer of winter warfare and later as a General Staff Officer in United States, West-Germany and South Korea. Last three years of his military career Marttinen spent as a Military advisor in Iran. He was a graduate of US Army Command and General Staff College (1950) and US Army War College (1963). Marttinen died 20 December 1975 at Falls Church, Virginia, and was buried at Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery. He had three sons. His oldest, Pekka Marttinen (1933–1958), served as a lieutenant in the 2d Stryker Cavalry Regiment. He was killed in a gunnery explosion in Grafenwöhr, Germany."

  "text" : "Allan G. S. Coombs was a Jamaican trade unionist. Coombs was born in the Parish of St. Ann, Jamaica in 1901. He described himself as \"a peasant of low birth, very limited education and a very poor man.\" He served first in the Jamaica Constabulary Force and later in The West India Regiment where he rose to the rank of Lance Corporal before he left in 1927. However, it was as a contractor in the Public Works Department that this powerfully built and charismatic figure became involved in the early national movement and the organization of labor. Coombs together with Hugh Clifford Buchanan, a mason by trade, founded the Jamaica Workers and Transport Union (JWTU) on May 17, 1936. Coombs described the very modest circumstances in which he and Buchanan started the JWTU. \"On the 17th day of May, 1936, I contracted six labourers in the Kingston Race Course and they pledged themselves to be members of the society, which they asked me to find a suitable name for.\" He could hardly have known that within a year this organization would attract island wide support and lay the foundations for what would emerge from the labor rebellion of 1938.The first phase of organizational effort climaxed in October with the JWTU participating in a labor conference at Liberty Hall along with members of the UNIA, the ex-servicemen and the Masons' Co-operative Union. Finally, on December 30, Coombs and his union felt confident enough to challenge the colonial administration by staging a march of the unemployed. After disregarding the advice of the Deputy Mayor to turn back, the marchers were charged by the police. A description of this event was provided by Coombs in his memorandum to the Moyne Commission:\"The people, all unarmed, were only carrying flags and banners bearing the words 'Starvation, Nakedness, Shelterless'. The Union Jack was torn in pieces? while the poor and unfortunate people received their floggings which necessitated many going to the hospital for treatment.\" Coombs responded by threatening a larger demonstration, and, more importantly, called on progressive persons island-wide to become representatives of his organization."

He founded the Mavrogenios Professional School of Malagari and also ordered built the marble fountain of the monastery of Zoodohos Pigi."

In 2006 Betancourt Reina was a reporter for Nueva Prensa Cubana, an independent news agency.He was arrested on 23 May 2006 while watching a forced eviction of poor people in La Guernica, Camagüey, and detained on charges of public disorder.According to the police he had joined a protest against the evictions.After being arrested, Betancourt was at first held in isolation, and could not see his family or lawyers.He was initially sentenced to three years in prison.In June and July 2006 his request to see a Catholic priest was denied by the authorities at Ceramica Rota (Red Ceramic) prison in Camaguey, where he was being held. He was one of three Cuban journalists who were given long prison sentences in 2006, the other two being Raymundo Perdigon Brito and Guillermo Espinosa Rodriguez.Betancourt said that during his stay in prison guards beat political prisoners, but not in front of witnesses. After beatings they kept the victim in solitary confinement for two or three weeks until their injuries had healed. During his confinement he shared a cell 13 by 16 feet (4.0 by 4.9 m) with 11 others. At the pretrial hearings that started on 8 February 2007 no defense witnesses were allowed to testify.The court postponed the case for further investigation.On 3 July 2007 he was tried again and sentenced to fifteen months in prison, with time already spent counting towards that sentence.Armando Betancourt Reina was freed on 20 August 2007 after completing his 15-month sentence.After his release Betancourt was told that his phone service would be cut off if he used it for \"counter-revolutionary activities.\" Some incidents from Betancourt's 2006-2007 prison stay are described in his book Morir sin Patria, which describes the experiences of people in a society dominated by lack of civil liberties."

In 1746 he married Elizabeth Vesey, a cousin of his. The couple had no children together, and Agmondesham was continuously unfaithful to Elizabeth but she maintained the façade of a happy marriage. Elizabeth nursed her husband through attacks of epilepsy, but depended for her support upon a circle of female friends. The couple split their time between London, England and Lucan in Ireland, but eventually settled mostly in London at houses in Clarges Street and Bolton Row, Mayfair, where Elizabeth hosted her intellectual salon parties. where entertainment consisted of conversations on literary subjects. Agmondesham Vesey died on 3 June 1785, leaving his wife and her companion, Miss Handcock, facing relative poverty, Agmondesham having left them nothing in his will, despite leaving £1000 to his mistress."

  "text" : "August Hoch (1868–1919) was the third director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City. As a neuropathologist and clinician, he exerted his influence on psychiatric developments during the early 20th century in the United States. Hoch was born in Basel, Switzerland, the son of a minister, who was also director of the Basel University Hospital. At the age of 19, he emigrated to the United States to pursue his education. He spent two years at the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was influenced by Dr. William Osler. When Osler moved to The Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, Hoch followed to work at the Johns Hopkins outpatient neurological clinic and to pursue medical training at the University of Maryland. He received his M.D. degree from the University of Maryland in 1890. He remained an assistant to Osler in the clinic. After several years, Hoch accepted a position at the McLean Psychiatric Hospital near Boston, Massachusetts, to develop the pathological and psychological laboratories and the clinical psychiatric programs. Before moving to McLean, he spent two years in Europe to study with Friedrich von Recklinghausen, a pathologist at the University of Strasbourg; with Wilhelm Wundt, a psychologist at the University of Leipzig; and with Emil Kraepelin, a psychiatrist at the University of Heidelberg. He married during his European trip. Hoch returned to McLean in 1895 to take up his position. Professionally, he studied the relationships between personality and psychosis. He also served as an instructor in neuropathology at Tufts Medical School in Massachusetts. He returned to Europe to study with Franz Nissl, a medical researcher and neuropathologist at the University of Heidelberg; and with Constantin von Monakow, a neuropathologist in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1905, Hoch moved to the Bloomingdale Hospital in White Plains, New York as its first assistant physician and special clinician. He became interested in psychoanalysis, which he believed would illuminate the field of human conduct. After four years at Bloomingdale, he was offered the directorship of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, following Dr. Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist) who was moving to the Johns Hopkins University. A major objective was to use the New York State Psychiatric Institute’s services as an educational locus for physicians working in the state hospitals. Hoch was actively involved in psychiatric organizations. He was president of the New York Psychiatric Society in 1908 and in 1909; president of the American Psychopathological Society in 1913; and president of the American Psychoanalytical Society. He was a member of the American Neurological Society, the American Medico-Psychological Society (now the American Psychiatric Association), and the New York Neurological Society. He was a leader in planning a scientific psychiatric journal by the Institute titled Psychiatric Bulletin. On 6 March 1913 Hoch introduced Eugen Bleuler's disease concept of schizophrenia to elite American alienists and neurologists for the first time during a meeting of the New York Psychiatrical Society. According to him, \"all of them made a lot of fun at the term, but it is remarkable what one can get used to.\" Hoch wrote one book, Benign Stupors: A Study of a New Manic-Depressive Reaction Type, and published many articles in psychiatric journals. He retired from the New York State Psychiatric Institute in 1917 because of ill health and moved to California. He was the live-in psychiatrist for Stanley McCormick at his Riven Rock estate in Santa Barbara. He died in 1917 of nephritis. Hoch left a legacy of clinical observation in psychiatry and provided a major stimulus for scientific work in the state hospitals."

Her actions may have played a role in securing the 1745 release of 16 men and 12 women who had been held in Belozersk. She was married to Johan Lackman (1702–1770). He was the parish clerk and precentor of Ilomantsi. They had three children, Juliana, Anna Gretha, and Mats (1738–1791). Salmelin lived with her son Mats and his family after her husband died.

In 1873–74, he spent a year in Berlin in the German Empire, and after having looked after the interests of the firm in London during the panic of 1873, returned to New York late in 1874. His father Philip Heidelbach died in 1875, and in 1876, Alfred joined the firm of Heidelbach, Ickelheimer & Co., which was founded in 1876 after the marriage of Isaac Ickelheimer to Philip Heidelbach's daughter. This firm made a specialty of foreign exchange and specie and were able to secure valuable connections abroad. He was a director of the United States Life Insurance Company. In 1893, the firm admitted Henry R. Ickelheimer, who represented the interest of his father, Isaac, one of the founders of the concern. Heidelbach was married, October 1879, in Paris, to Julie Picard. He was a prominent member of the Manhattan, Reform and Lawyers clubs. Heidelbach died on February 1, 1922."

  "text" : "Austin Hope (born 1973) is the president and winemaker of Hope Family Wines, a Paso Robles, California-based wine producer encompassing the Liberty School, Treana, Austin Hope, Troublemaker and Candor wine labels. He lives in Paso Robles, California with his wife, Celeste Hope. A third generation farmer, Hope moved from Bakersfield to Paso Robles with his family in 1978 when his parents Chuck and Marlyn Hope bought a ranch to plant apple orchards and grape vineyards. The Hope family realized that Paso Robles was better suited for grape growing, which became their signature crop. Hope was eight years old when the grapes came on the line; growing up, he would often play in the vineyards as his father worked. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Hope family grew grapes for various wine producers. In the 1980s, the Wagner family, owners of Napa Valley’s Caymus Vineyards turned to the Hope family to source Cabernet Sauvignon grapes for their Liberty School label. This began a long-lasting partnership between the two families. While studying fruit science at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, Hope spent some time working in Napa Valley under Caymus Winemaker Chuck Wagner. This opportunity solidified his decision to pursue winemaking for his family, which later became Hope Family Wines. After graduating from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in 1996 with a Bachelor of Science, Hope helped oversee his family’s transition from growers to winemakers. That year, the Hopes acquired Liberty School from the Wagners. In 1996, they launched Treana Winery – Hope helped produce Treana’s debut 1996 vintage as assistant winemaker under Chris Phelps. Hope became the head winemaker in 1998 and has held the position ever since. Since taking the lead as president and winemaker, Hope has helped Hope Family Wines grow from producing around 20,000 cases per year to over 300,000 cases per year. In 2000, the Hope family started a limited-production label, Austin Hope, focused exclusively on Rhone varietals grown on the family’s vineyard, located in one of the Templeton Gap area’s microclimates in Paso Robles’ cooler climate west side. In 2008, the Hope family introduced Candor Wines, a multi-vintage label focusing on Zinfandel and Merlot wines with fruit sourced from family-owned vineyards in Santa Barbara, Paso Robles and Lodi. It introduced its second multi-vintage blend, named Troublemaker, in 2010. Hope believes multi-vintage blending enables enhanced complexity and drinkability."

Gay lived in Bedfordshire until his death in 2013; an obituary appeared in Jazz Journal's March 2014 edition. After having played with the Jive Bombers, Gay worked with Freddy Randall from 1953, and would return several times to Randall’s future line-ups. In the early 1960s, he was with Bob Wallis' Storyville Jazzmen before going on to join Alex Welsh. With fellow tenors Dick Morrissey and Stan Robinson, baritone sax Paul Carroll, and trumpets Ian Carr, Kenny Wheeler and Greg Brown, Al Gay formed part of The Animals' Big Band that made its one-and-only public appearance at the 5th Annual British Jazz & Blues Festival in Richmond on 5 August 1965. In 1978, he played with the World's Greatest Jazz Band. As well as leading his own line-ups, Gay has also played in bands led by Digby Fairweather, Laurie Chescoe and Ron Russell, as well as with the Pizza Express All Stars."

Bishara, a Palestinian from the Upper Galilee, is presently the General Director of the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies  and the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies. Previously, he was a member of the Israeli legislature, the Knesset. Bishara won election as a member of the Balad Party, a group which represents the interests of the Arab citizens of Israel, and of which he was a founder. Following visits to Lebanon and Syria in the wake of the 2006 Lebanon War, Bishara became the subject of an Israeli criminal investigation for money laundering, contact with a foreign agent, delivery of information to the enemy and, most seriously, assistance to the enemy during war. Bishara was subsequently stripped of his parliamentary immunity and fled Israel without having returned since. Bishara has since established himself in Qatar, where in addition to his academic and research endeavors (see above) he is a public intellectual active in the pan-Arab sphere and continues to write, as well as to issue new editions of some of his earlier works, including a 2012 re-publication of one of his most well-known Arabic books, On Civil Society. Additionally, Bishara helped to establish the \"New Arab\" media conglomerate, which includes a newspaper with online and print editions, and an online-only English version, as well as a television station, which launched in 2014. Politically, Bishara has been identified with both Marxism and with the anti-sectarian, enlightenment ideals of Arab nationalism. In this regard, he is the successor to Tawfik Ziad."

Crimmins was followed and covertly recorded by the New York Police Department for two years, before finally being charged and going to trial in 1968. She was found guilty and sent to prison, later released on appeal, recharged and found guilty again in 1971, overturned in 1973, reinstated and reincarcerated in 1975. She was paroled in 1977. The Crimmins trial has been compared by some in the media to the Casey Anthony trial."

Agnes gave birth to her first son named Ernst August Georg, known as George Street, on 21 January 1854. Her second child with her husband Captain Ernst Denis-Street was named Charles, born on 18 July 1855. Her third child was named Fernande (16 December 1856 – 23 August 1857), daughter of the composer and revolutionary activist Ferdinand Lassalle.

  "text" : "Antoine Marcel Lemoine (born Paris November 3, 1763, died Paris April, 1817) was the founder of the music publishing establishment in Paris and a guitar virtuoso and skilful performer on the violin and viola. He was also the father of Henry Lemoine, who took over his publishing business. Antoine Lemoine's father was a dramatic artist, who gave him his first elementary lessons on the guitar and violin, but beyond this rudimentary instruction Lemoine was self-taught. His father led a wandering, restless life. When Antoine Lemoine was sixteen-and-a-half years old he was married and for the next few years followed the example of his parents, wandering with his wife and obtaining a livelihood by violin and guitar playing. In 1781 he settled in Paris and obtained employment as violinist in the Theatre Montansier in Versailles; after playing in the orchestra for two years, he resigned this position to commence as a teacher of the guitar and violin in Paris. During the year 1789 he was worked in the Theatre Monsieur orchestra as alto player. In 1772, he began a music publishing business, called A l'Espérance (To Hope), which was continued after his death by his son Henry as Henry Lemoine and Company. The business has flourished and by 1914 was well known for the number of good-quality compositions issued for the mandolin and guitar. In 1790 another publisher, Imbault of Paris, published several of Lemoine's compositions and theoretical works, including a method for the guitar. This rapidly passed several editions. Three years later Lemoine devoted himself entirely to music publishing, but after the revolution, he placed his business under capable management and officiated as conductor successively of the orchestras of the Theatre Molière, Mareux, and of the Rue Culture and St. Catherine. Although Lemoine had received no instruction in harmony or counterpoint, he successfully composed, arranged, and orchestrated all the music performed in these theatres. In 1795 he revised and augmented his method for the guitar, publishing this edition himself. Additionally, he, continued to write compositions for other publishers; he also issued about twenty-five of his own works, consisting of variations, potpourris, etc., for guitar solo and duos for guitar and violin. When the six-stringed guitar, constructed in the shape of a lyre and named the lyre-guitar, became fashionable at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Lemoine wrote and published (in 1805) a new elementary treatise for this instrument under the title of Method for the guitar of six strings, but a few years later his compositions for the guitar were eclipsed by those of Ferdinando Carulli. Lemoine, however, was fully aware of the superiority of the later works of this rising generation of guitar virtuosi and he was among the first to issue the compositions of Ferdinando Carulli, Fernando Sor, Luigi Sagrini, Dionisio Aguado, Mauro Giuliani, Joseph Küffner and Luigi Castellacci."

  "text" : "Abraham Myerson, M.D. (1881-1948) was an American neurologist, psychiatrist, clinician, pathologist, and researcher. He had a special interest in the heredity of psychiatric and neurologic disease. Myerson was born in Lithuania, the son of a school teacher. His father emigrated to the United States in 1885, and sent for his family in 1886, settling in New Britain, Connecticut. In 1892, the family moved to Boston, Massachusetts. He attended the Boston public schools, graduated from high school in 1898, and then worked for seven years to earn money to attend medical school. He attended the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University for one year and then left for financial reasons. He worked as a street car conductor for a year, and then returned to Columbia for his second year. He transferred to Tufts Medical School in Boston, and graduated in 1908 with a M.D. At Tufts, Myerson was a student of Dr. Morton Prince, and in his later years, Myerson held the chair in neurology which had been Prince’s. He opened his medical office in Boston, and also served as an assistant physician in neurology at Boston City Hospital for two years. He spent six months in the neuropathology laboratory of Dr. Elmer E. Southard at Harvard University. He moved to St. Louis, Missouri for his residency in neurology at the Alexian Brothers Hospital and an instructor in neurology at St. Louis University. He returned to Boston in 1912 to join the first group of residents at the newly opened Boston Psychopathic Hospital. From 1913 to 1917, he served as the clinical director and pathologist at Taunton State Hospital. In 1927, Myerson became director of research at Boston State Hospital. In 1933, the Massachusetts legislature approved the building of a new laboratory for Myerson with funds provided by the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1935, he was appointed professor of clinical psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in recognition of the accomplishments in his research. He was also appointed assistant professor of neurology at Tufts Medical School, and from 1921 to 1940, he served as the Chair of neurology at Tufts. In 1940, Myerson became Professor Emeritus. During the first decades of the 20th century, the eugenics movement became prominent and widely supported by lay and professional groups. Myerson disagreed with the involuntary sterilization of feeble minded and mentally ill patients. While at Taunton State Hospital, he conducted a study and published his findings in The Inheritance of Mental Disease (1925), which showed that only ten percent of in-patients had a relative who had been confined to the hospital since its opening in 1854. Myerson believed that while there could be a heredity factor involved, social environment also played a major role. Myerson maintained an active practice and served as Massachusetts state forensic examiner for eight years. He testified at the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti. He was a supporter of electric shock therapy and taught its use. He believed in the interdependence of mind and body and a physiological approach in psychiatry and neurology. Myerson introduced “total push” in treating patients with chronic schizophrenic patients and affected by the regressive and iatrogenic treatment patterns in state mental hospitals. The growth of psychoanalytic practices in the United States interested Myerson. He thought that psychoanalysis led to the examination of human beings more closely and stimulated better research in the areas of biology and physiology. Though he appreciated Sigmund Freud’s contributions, Myerson opposed psychoanalysis. Myerson was active in professional organizations: the American Psychiatric Association (representative to the National Research Council), the American Neurological Association, the Greater Boston Medical Society, the American Psychopathological Society (president, 1938-1939), the Advisory Council for Research in nervous and mental disease for the U.S. Public Health Service, and director of the Mental Hygiene Society. He published ten books and numerous scholarly research articles. He died in 1948 of heart disease. The Infrequent Blinking Sign in Parkinson's Disease is named after him."

  "text" : "Aert Hendrik Kuipers (10 November 1919 in Oostkapelle or Middelburg – 1 December 2012) was a Dutch linguistics professor who, from his pioneering fieldwork among First Nations people of British Columbia during the 1950s, compiled the first detailed reference grammars of Squamish and Shuswap, two almost extinct Salishan languages. He also advised Jan van Eijk in his work on Lillooet and Hank Nater in his work on Nuxalk and did import work on comparative Salishan. After obtaining his PhD at Columbia University in 1951 with the study A contribution to the analysis of the Qabardian language, Kuipers was on the faculty of the University of British Columbia from 1951 to 1954. During those years, as well as in the course of a 1956 field trip, he collected extensive material on the Squamish language. From 1960 to1983 Kuipers taught linguistics at Leiden University; after 1971 he was a professor in the department of Slavic languages and culture, specializing in Caucasian languages. Kuipers has a strong commitment to helping to preserve a record of threatened and endangered languages. As a 1998 article in The Economist put it: \"Aert Kuipers ... went to Canada recently with the intention of locating and preserving American Indian languages. He came across dozens, some limited to a single valley, others spoken by only a few dozen people. He settled on one, learnt it and put together a dictionary and a primer. But by the time he had finished there was only one other speaker of the language left.\" Kuipers responded to this in a letter that his arrival in Canada (nearly half a century earlier) hardly was \"recently\" and that the Economist may have conflated Squamish and Shuswap with regard to the \"one speaker left\" statement."

  "text" : "Anna Balakian (14 July 1915 in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire (now Istanbul, Turkey) – 12 August 1997 in New York City, United States), former chair of the Department of Comparative Literature at New York University, was internationally recognized as an authority on symbolism and surrealism. She served as President of the American Comparative Literature Association from 1977 to 1980 and was a longtime leader in the International Comparative Literature Association. The author of numerous acclaimed books and articles, she was the recipient of many awards. Of Armenian descent, Anna Balakian was born in Constantinople, Istanbul. At the age of 11 she moved with her family to New Britain, Connecticut. She earned the bachelor's degree at Hunter College, the master's and doctorate degree at Columbia University. While in graduate school, she taught French literature and language full-time at the Hunter College High School. She published her first book, The Literary Origins of Surrealism in 1947. In this groundbreaking study of the founders of modem French poetry, Anna Balakian placed avant-garde writers and artists against the background of French and German romanticism. In 1953 she began her long career at New York University culminating in her eight year chairmanship of the Department of Comparative Literature. Balakian's next book, Surrealism: The Road to the Absolute (1959), is a richly informed exposition of, and apologia for, surrealist literature and art. In The Symbolist Movement: A Critical Appraisal (1969) she gives a concise yet detailed account of symbolist poetry. Her André Breton: Magus of Surrealism (1971) was the first full-scale biography of founder of the surrealist movement. With her sister, Nona Balakian, a literary critic and an editor at The New York Times Book Review, she was part of a literary circle that included the playwright William Saroyan and the diarist Anaïs Nin. Nona Balakian died in 1991. In 2004, the International Comparative Literature Association established the Anna Balakian Prize to promote scholarly research by younger comparatists and to honor the memory of her."

The trio, who were known as the “The McNulty Family’s Irish Showboat Revue”, first appeared on stage as such in 1932-1933 and through Ma’s astute show business acumen became almost immediately and remained for decades an astounding success on the U.S. East Coast entertainment circuit. The trio eventually appeared regularly on radio and at such venues as the Rockefeller Center's Radio City Music Hall, the Yorkville Casino, New York City’s Leitrim House and at Rockaway Beach, Queens. For 16 consecutive years the trio of \"Ma\" McNulty, Eileen McNulty and Peter McNulty sold out the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s 2,109 seat Howard Gillman Opera House. In their near 2 decades of music recording for labels like Decca Records, Standard and Copley from 1938-1956, the McNulty family’s “Showboat Revue” released 155 sides on 78-rpm shellac & vinyl. In 1953, they appeared through the then new entertainment venue of television on Milton Berle’s wildly popular Texaco Star Theater. “Ma” McNulty did not appear on stage during her children's earlier duo performances. In 1926, after one theater’s “professor” was unable to keep proper time for her children, “Ma” began, herself, keeping time for them from backstage on an old melodeon accordion. By 1928, she had been encouraged to perform on stage with her children. Though by the late 1930s, radio and motion pictures had already there and throughout the nation eclipsed as popular entertainment vaudeville, which had begun in the 1880s, the McNulty family managed to keep the art of Irish “vaudevillian” or variety theater alive on the U.S. East Coast well into the 1950s. The McNulty family had a powerful influence on the development of the Music of Newfoundland and Labrador in its modern era. Another testament to the popularity of the McNulty Family was the impressive number of recordings they made for Decca, Standard, and Copley: 155 sides on 78-rpm releases."

He was well known for leading the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO first cellist from 1891 to 1903 and from 1910 to 1912, and section cellist member from 1918 to 1925). He was the cellist of the Kneisel Quartet from 1891 to 1907. Alwin was the youngest of four sons of Carl Schroeder (Karl Schröder I, 1816–1890 or 1823–1889), the music director in Neuhaldensleben. He had three older brothers that were also musicians: Hermann Schroeder (1843–1909) became a composer and violin professor in Berlin, Germany; Carl Karl Schröder II II (1848–1935) became a cello professor in the Leipzig Conservatory before being appointed as court conductor to the Prince of Sondershausen in 1881; and Franz (born before 1855 – ?) would work as a conductor in St. Petersburg, Russia. Alwin was seven years old when he began his music studies, he received piano lessons from his father and violin lessons from his eldest brother. Later, he studied the piano with J. B. Andre at Ballenstedt and attended the Berlin Hochschule fur Musik, studying violin with De Ahna and music theory with Tappert. It was during his tenure at the Leipzig Conservatory that he had the idea for a progressively ordered compilation of etudes by various cellists. He published it many years later in the United States as the three-volume and called it 170 Foundation Studies for Violoncello. Among Schroeder’s publications during the Leipzig years were his Neue Tonleiter-Studien and Technische Uebungen for the development of left-hand technique for cellists and his edition of the six solo cello suites by J. S. Bach."

  "text" : "Aaron Altaras (born 1995 in Berlin) is a German actor. Altaras was born in Berlin on 21 November 1995 to a Croatian Jewish mother Adriana Altaras and German father Wolfgang Böhmer. Altaras' mother was forced to escape Croatia with his grandparents, Jakob and Thea Altaras, because his grandfather has been politically persecuted in a mounted court case by the League of Communists of Croatia. His mother is a known actress, theater director and writer, and his father is a composer. He was raised with his younger brother Leonard. Altaras attended the elementary school \"Heinz Galinski Schule\" in Berlin. During his education at the \"Heinz-Galinski-Schule\" he was discovered by a casting team for the movie \"Mogelpackung Mann\". In 2006 he started to attend the gymnasium \"Jüdische Oberschule Berlin\" (Jewish school Berlin). Altaras achieved nationwide attention with the lead role in the ARD TV movie \"Nicht alle waren Mörder\" based on the childhood and youth memories of Michael Degen, German actor and writer who survived the Nazi regime as a Jewish boy in Germany."

The main topics of his works were the hills of Córdoba, the Pampas plains, the mountains of Tandil, the coast of Quilmes, the ravines of San Isidro beside the Río de la Plata, and Piriapolis in Uruguay. He moved for a period to the Córdoba hills, painting in the open air, and on returning to Buenos Aires staged exhibitions at which he successfully sold all his works. He studied art at the Asociación de Estímulo de Bellas Artes (Fine Arts Association), and made several trips to study art in the Argentine interior, Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay."

  "text" : "Albert Andrew Muwalo Gandale Nqumayo (1927 – 1977) was a prominent politician in Malawi from the 1960s until he lost power in 1976 and was executed in 1977. He entered politics in the mid 1950s through involvement in a hospital worker's trade union and membership of the Nyasaland African Congress, where his activities led to his detention without trial during the 1959 State of Emergency in Nyasaland. After his release, he joined the Malawi Congress Party (MCP), and became locally prominent in Ntcheu District as district MCP chairman and from 1962 as Member of Parliament for Ntcheu South. In 1963, he became Administrative Secretary of the MCP, and he was a prominent supporter of the then-Prime Minister, Hastings Banda during the Cabinet Crisis of 1964. Muwalo was rewarded for his loyalty with the cabinet post of Minister of Information in 1964, and in 1966 he became Minister of State in the President's Office. His close contact with Banda, both as minister in Banda's office and in the MCP gave him great power and, during the first half of the 1970s he and his relative, the Head of the Police Special Branch Focus Gwede, were heavily involved in the political repression of actual or suspected opponents of the Banda regime. In 1976 he and Gwede were arrested: the reasons for their arrests were unclear, but may have resulted from a power struggle among those around the ageing president or simply because he became too powerful and may have been seen by Banda as a threat. In 1977, the two were tried before a Traditional Court and after a trial whose fairness was in serious doubt, were both sentenced to death. Gwede was reprieved, but Muwalo was hanged on 3 September 1977."

  "text" : "Alexander von Bunge (9 November 1851, Dorpat – 19 January 1930, Tallinn) was a Baltic-German physician, zoologist and Arctic explorer in the employ of Russia. He was the son of botanist Alexander Georg von Bunge (1803–1890). From 1870 to 1878, he was a student at the University of Dorpat, where in 1874–75, he also worked as an assistant in the institute of anatomy. In 1880 he earned his medical doctorate, relocating to St. Petersburg during the following year. Here, he enlisted with the Russian Geographical Society on a meteorological expedition to the Lena River delta (1882–1884). In 1885–86, with geologist Eduard von Toll (1858–1902), he participated on a scientific journey to the Verkhoyansk region and the New Siberian Islands. On the expedition, they found the remains of mammoths and the fossils of other large mammals, and in the process, demonstrated that the New Siberian Islands had a relatively warm climate during the Late Pleistocene. Eduard von Toll gave the name \"Bunge Land\" for the low sandy shoal region joining Kotelny Island to Faddeyevsky Peninsula (formerly believed to be separate islands). Beginning in 1886, he worked as a physician on various Russian frigates, later participating in the Russo-Japanese War as head physician of the Russian Pacific Ocean squadron and marine hospitals in Port Arthur. In 1905 he embarked on an expedition to the mouth of the Yenisey River by way of the Northeast Passage. From 1906 to 1914, he was head physician in the Russian Baltic Sea navy. and during World War I was director of several military hospitals in St. Petersburg. In 1918 he relocated to Estonia, taking up residence at Mõtliku, a farmstead he inherited from his father. In 1924 moved to Tallinn, where he died six years later on January 19, 1930."

  "text" : "Adema Sangale is a businesswoman and social entrepreneur. She is also an alumnus of United States International University(USIU) and later Oxford University and Harvard UniversityShe joined Procter and Gamble as a result of a university recruitment programme. Her interests led her to the heart of any P&G operation in numerous locations around the globe including Africa, Europe and North America. Whilst at P&G she is most renowned for her pioneering ‘bottom of the pyramid’ solutions in bringing to global attention the plight of girls not attending school during their menstruation. She led the efforts to bring together a coalition of stakeholders from government, media and civil society to abolish taxation on sanitary pads. The key insight was that economically disadvantaged girls missed 4–5 days of school per month because they could not afford effective menstrual protection methods such as sanitary pads. This work spread to countries in sub-Saharan Africa, on the Indian sub-continent and was featured in a US advertising campaign for the Always brand. This was later featured in the New York Times. Adema initially served as a Brand manager for Always and Pampers in Kenya, Nigeria and Poland, P&G decided to elevate her to the position of Managing Director for East Africa.This was based on her passionate yet subtle management style. In 2004 she became the youngest local CEO to head a multinational company in Kenya at the age of 27. Simultaneously, she held the same position in an office which she ran from South Africa whereby she used to oversee marketing and communications across sub-Saharan Africa including in Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania, Namibia, Rwanda and Kenya.Her most recent role in Canada included integrating marketing and brand communications for the fast-moving consumer goods conglomerate in the North American country. She also championed a campaign with David Johnston, Governor General of Canada behind the spirit of a more caring Canada. P&G is the world’s number one FMCG Company with an estimated daily turnover of $3 billion daily.The range of products includes sanitary pads, diapers, detergents, hair and beauty care products.Adema received one of the prestigious Chevening Awarda and has a Masters of Business Administration degree from the University of Oxford, UK and a Master of Public Administration Degree from Harvard University where she was an Edward S. Mason Fellow. She was recently nominated a New Generation Leader by the African Leadership Network. Adema also served as past chair of the Business Women’s Initiative in Kenya an initiate founded by Mary Robinson former President of Ireland.

Rollandin has served as the President of Aosta Valley from January 4, 1984, to June 25, 1990, and again from July 1, 2008, to the present. In July 2013, Rollandin was re-elected to the presidency by a coalition of center-right, pro-autonomy parties consisting of the Valdostan Union (UV) and the Edelweiss (SA). The coalition government, led by the Valdostan Union, lost 14 percentage points in the May 2013 Aosta Valley regional election, a decline from the 2008 election results, but still retained an absolute majority in the Council of the Valley. Rollandin's coalition was supported by 18 of the 35 Council members. In his July 2013 speech to the Council upon his re-election, Rolladin promised that his government would pay \"the utmost attention\" to the French language, which shares official status in the Aosta Valley with Italian. He also reiterated the \"relevance\" in \"cultural policies\" of the Aosta Valley's two regional languages, Franco-Provençal (also called Valdôtain locally) and Walser German."

  "text" : "Alexandra Dmitrievna Lublinskaya (1902 – January 22, 1980) was a Russian scholar specialising in the history of seventeenth-century France, among other things. Her French Absolutism, originally published in Russian in 1965, and translated into English by Brian Pearce, with a foreword by J. H. Elliott, was published by Cambridge University Press in 1968. It is a criticism of the general crisis of the 17th century thesis proposed by Hugh Trevor-Roper. The \"general crisis\" thesis generated controversy between supporters of this theory and those, such as the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, who believed in the \"general crisis,\" but saw the problems of 17th-century Europe as more social and economic in origin than Trevor-Roper would allow. A third faction comprised those who simply denied there was any \"general crisis,\" including Lublinskaya, Dutch historian Ivo Schöffer and the Danish historian Niels Steengsgaard. Her professional publications number over 200, on a great variety of topics, but can be broken into three categories: works on paleography, critical publication of historical documents, and monographs and articles on the social and political history of medieval and early modern France (\"middle ages\" in Soviet chronology extended to about 1650). Her magnum opus was a series of books on the history of the administration of Richelieu. The first book was Frantsiia v nachale XVII veka (1610-1622 gg.) \"France at the beginning of the 17th century, 1610-1620\" published in 1959. This was followed by French Absolutism: the Crucial Phase, 1620-1629 in 1965. A third book was published just before her death covering the years 1630-42. Another major work was Frantsuzskie krest'iane v XVI-XVIII vv. (\"French peasants in the 16th-18th centuries\"), published in 1978."

  "text" : "Ahmad Khalaf al-Dulaimi (Arabic: احمد خلف الدليمي‎‎, also Ahmad Khalaf Muhammad al-Dulaimi, Ahmed Khalaf Dheyabi) is an Iraqi politician and was the Governor of Al Anbar province from August 2013 to December 2014. The Anbar governorate election was held in June 2013, amidst on-going demonstrations in Sunni Arab majority areas. The elections in Anbar were topped by the pro-protest 'Uniters List', which allied the al-Hadba party of Usama al-Nujayfi, the speaker of the Council of Representatives of Iraq with the Iraqi Islamic Party, which had controlled al-Anbar governorate from 2005 to 2009. The previous governor, Qasim Al-Fahdawi, was a businessman who had been nominated by the Awakening parties that had won the 2009 elections. He served 2007-09 as Director of Internal Security for Al-Anbar Governorate, and before that as an instructor at the Iraqi Military Academy. He is married and has six children. Ahmad Khalaf al-Dulaimi, a protest organizer from the Iraqi Islamic Party, was eventually chosen as the new Governor. He was sworn in on Tuesday 20 August 2013. After being sworn in, al-Dulaimi met with protest leaders, and vowed to defend them should they be targeted by any party. Ahmad Khalaf al-Dulaimi was wounded in the head and chest on September 7, 2014 during an operation against anti-government forces in the town of Barwana, al-Anbar Province. He was flown to Amman, Jordan for treatment, and then to Berlin, Germany. One member of al-Dulaimi's security team and seven soldiers were killed in the attack. In December 2014 the Anbar Provincial Council moved to have the governor retired, and he was replaced by Suhaib al-Rawi."

  "text" : "August Max Closs (9 August 1898 – 21 June 1990) was a professor of German studies. Born in Austria, he studied German and English language and literature, and in 1929 moved to London. There he taught at University College, and became friends with the German scholar Robert Priebsch, whose daughter Hannah he married. In 1931 he began teaching at the University of Bristol, where he stayed until his retirement in 1964. He was a prolific author on and editor and anthologizer of German poetry. In addition, he was a dedicated collector of manuscripts and books; part of his collection was sold to Princeton University, and the rest forms the Priebsch-Closs Collection Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies. He is remembered also for his efforts to bring about German-English reconciliation after the Second World War, especially between the cities of Bristol and Hanover."

  "text" : "Angeliki \"Gelly\" Skarlatou (Greek: Αγγελική Σκαρλάτου; born 28 January 1976 in Amaliada) is a Greek windsurfer, who specialized in Mistral and Neil Pryde RS:X classes. She represented Greece in four editions of the Olympic Games (1996, 2000, 2012, and 2016), and has earned numerous national and sporting titles, including gold medals at the Eurolymp Week, during her career. As of September 2013, she is ranked no. 40 in the world for the sailboard class by the International Sailing Federation. Skarlatou made her official debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where she placed twenty-third in women's Mistral sailboard with a net score of 149 points. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Skarlatou posted a grade of 159 to improve her placement status with a twenty-first-place finish in the same program. In 2004, Skarlatou decided not to compete in her third Olympics for the host nation, and instead, completed a Bachelor of Arts degree of sports science at Athens University and a master's degree in marketing at Brunel University in London, United Kingdom. Twelve years after competing in her last Olympics, Skarlatou qualified for her second Greek team, as a 36-year-old, in the RS:X class at the 2012 Summer Olympics by receiving a berth from the ISAF Sailing World Championships in Perth, Western Australia. Though she fell short of her slot for the medal rounds, Skarlatou achieved her best Olympic result with a sixteenth-place effort in a fleet of twenty-six sailors, accumulating a net score of 134 points. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, she competed in the RS:X class again. She finished 19th with a net score of 171 points."

  "text" : "Antonio de Puga (1602-1648), was a Spanish Baroque painter. Antonio de Puga was born in Ourense, son of a tailor of the same name and Ynés Rodriguez. He was the first notable artist from Galicia, and through the research of Maria Luisa Caturla, his main biographer and scholar, an accurate dating of some aspects of his life has been possible. There was no news of his life after his brith records until 1635, where a document declared that he worked \"By order and in house Painter Eugenio Caxés was his late majesty in quadros of good retirement and gave me quenta than Rs Ducientos trabaxe it.\" In the decoration of the Hall of Realms in the Buen Retiro Palace Eugenio Cajés corresponded to two of the paintings of battles: The Cadereita and his army, now lost, and the Recovery of Puerto Rico by D. Juan de Haro, Museo del Prado, who, dying in December 1634, left unfinished, supplementing Luis Fernández. It has been discussed how much might assume de Puga's work was included in these tables, there is some consensus in attributing the landscape. Some historians have tried to fill the gap until 1635 assuming documentary would ecclesiastical studies before turning to painting, but what of that will be seen in 1634 is that Puga was already a trained painter, as he had done a portrait of the Duke of Medina de las Torres Luis Ramirez de Haro and his participation had given some importance in the decoration of the palace. Of that will be seen, too, which was established in Madrid working occasionally as an assistant to Caxés, who may be his teacher. In 1636 he painted St. Jerome (Bowes Museum in Barnard Castle), very similar to another of Francisco Collantes. In 1641 the ambassador of Modena in Madrid, Camilo Guidi, in a letter to his master praised de Puga when he completed landscapes with equestrian portraits. Also it was mentioned a significant number of portraits were completed, usually smudges that serve as models for the various copies made at the workshop. With the portraits of Philip IV of Spain (and horse heads) and other members of the royal family, are cited portraits of various members of the nobility (counts of Lemos, Duke of Aricoste) for those he worked with some regularity. Thus in 1643 a charge for unspecified paintings and flag he had made for the Marquis of Viana, governor of Oran, who still had a debt with him at the time of issuing the second will. Of this document, written in 1648, on the eve of his death, and the subsequent auction of its assets had gathered shows that a significant number of works by other artists, and a respectable library of more than a hundred volumes, which along with the usual works of devotion and the office's own poetic works are comedies that seem to indicate a high level of culture. Mention in the paper is made of three officers who worked for him, pointing to the existence of a workshop with a large volume of work."

He was from Petersburg, VA and became one of the nations top jockeys in the 1940s and 1950s. Arnold Kirkland rode in the Kentucky Derby five times. His best finish was a 3rd on Hasseyanda in 1954. That year the Derby was won by Determine. He was known for his stick work (whipping) and in 1948 won the Peter Pan Stakes on Escadu. It was on Escadru where he famously challenged Citation on the far turn in that years Belmont Stakes. Kirkland and Escadru made a bold run where the lead was whittled to 2 lengths with just 3/8 of a mile to go. Citation then spurted clear and became the eighth Triple Crown winner while the team of Kirkland and Escadru settled for 3rd. Kirland rode for many famous owners such as C. V. Whitney. He won the 1945 Wood Memorial on Jeep and piloted the 2 Year Old Filly Champion of 1946 First Flight twice, as well. Mr. Kirkland won many of the east coast's biggest races. They included: the 1944 Delaware Handicap on Everget, the 1946 Massachusetts Handicap on Pavot and the Rhode Island Handicap of that year on Man O' Glory. In 1948, he had two signature wins on Gallorette in the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga Race Course and Donor in the Narragansett Special at Narragansett Park just in the month of August. His last Kentucky Derby mount was on Countermand in 1956 where he drew the #17 post, was extremely wide on the first turn, and came home last (17th) to Needles. Arnold Kirkland died on March 15, 1969 and is buried at Woodland Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)."

He has also been training for the Royal Swedish Yacht Club (Swedish: Kungliga Svenska Segel Sällskapet) throughout most of his sporting career under his personal coach and mentor Per Frykholm. As of September 2013, Dahlberg was ranked no. 28 in the world in the two-person dinghy class by the International Sailing Federation. Dahlberg made his official debut at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he paired up with crew member Sebastian Östling in the men's 470 class. The Swedish duo finished fifteenth in a ten-round opening series with a net score of 111, trailing Israelis Gideon Kliger and Udi Gal by a narrow, three-point gap in the final standings. Dahlberg qualified to compete for the second time as a skipper in the men's 470 class at the Olympics by finishing eleventh and receiving at the ISAF World Championships in Perth, Western Australia. Teaming again with Ostling in the opening series, the Swedish duo achieved four top 10 finishes to guarantee a spot in the final race, but fell short for the podium with an accumulated net score of 123 points and a tenth-place finish in a fleet of twenty-seven boats."

After the age of 19 years, he studied painting with abbot Domenico Benedetto Gravina, and was called to work for two years in the Duomo of Monreale. He taught himself illustration, and in 1872, he helped illustrate a book on the Palatine Chapel of Palermo, Il Duomo di Monreale, written by professor Michele Amari, Monsignor Isidoro Carini, and Saverio Cavallaro. The book won an award at the 1873 Universal Exposition of Vienna, and in 1878, at the Exposizione Universale of Paris, and at other artistic and industrial expositions in Palermo. In 1877, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce lobbied the King to name him a knight in the Order of the Crown of Italy, for his work at the Palatine Chapel. He also produced chromolithography tables for the Ministry of Education with depictions of the plants of Sicily, and the topography, and the archeological sites of Syracuse.

In 1593 he was invested with the lordship of Hermann Castle in Narva, Estonia. 20 November 1598 King Sigismund named him as the commander-in-chief of Finland. At the war between Duke Charles and Sigismund he was defeated on 29 August 1599 by the troops of Duke Charles in Marttila, Finland. Kurck retreated to the Karelian town of Viborg (now Vyborg, Russia) and was later captured. He was sentenced to death in Åbo (Fi. Turku), but managed to survive the Åbo Bloodbath on which 14 supporters of Sigismund were beheaded. Kurck and captain Arvid Stålarm were sent to Linköping where they were tried and condemned along with other captured opposition leaders. Stålarm and Kurck also survived the subsequent Linköping bloodbath but remained imprisoned in the Gripsholm Castle. Kurck was released in September 1602 as Stålarm died in prison in 1620. During the Ingrian War Kurck served as a captain under the command of Jacob De la Gardie. Kurck spent his last years at the Anola estate in Nakkila, Sweden (now Finland). He is buried at the St. Olaf's Church in the Western Finnish town of Ulvila."

  "text" : "Alice Vonk (1908–1997) was an American floriculturist. She received the $10,000 prize for creating the whitest marigold in David Burpee's seed challenge. The competition was run by Burpee's seed company, W. Atlee Burpee & Co, founded by his father Washington Atlee Burpee. The $10,000 prize makes her flower the costliest marigold in the world, and the costliest flower in the world at the time. Burpee Seeds' quest for a white marigold started 56 years before Vonk's creation. It started running in 1954, and was ended by Vonk in 1975. Before winning her prize, Vonk received $100 from Burpee seeds the previous year along with five other gardeners for having seeds that produced close to white flowers. Vonk kept seeds from the lightest flowers in her garden each season, replanting for over two decades before achieving a pure white marigold that measured 2.5 inches in diameter. Alice Vonk, born in 1908, had been gardening since she was 11 and had no formal science training."

  "text" : "Alastair David Shaw Fowler CBE FBA (born 1930, Glasgow, Scotland) is a Scottish literary critic and editor, an authority on Edmund Spenser, Renaissance literature, genre theory, and numerology. Fowler was educated at the University of Edinburgh, M.A. (1952). He was subsequently awarded an M.A. (1955), D.Phil (1957) and D.Litt (1962) from Oxford. As a graduate student at Oxford, Fowler studied with C. S. Lewis, and later edited Lewis's Spenser's Images of Life. Fowler was junior research fellow at Queen's College, Oxford (1955–59). He also taught at Swansea (1959–61), and Brasenose College, Oxford (1962–71). He was Regius Professor of literature at the University of Edinburgh (1972–84) and also taught intermittently at universities in the United States, including Columbia (1964) and the University of Virginia (1969, 1979, 1985–98). Fowler is known for his editorial work. His edition of John Milton's Paradise Lost, part of the Longman poets series, has some of the most scholarly and detailed notes on the poem and is widely cited by Milton scholars. Writing in The Guardian, John Mullan called it \"a monument of scholarship.\" His book Kinds of Literature is a pioneering study in the field of genre scholarship. Fowler has been critical of some recent trends in literary scholarship, including \"new historicism.\" In 2005, he published an extremely critical review of Stephen Greenblatt's Will in the World, which was widely discussed. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to literature and education. Fowler's papers are on deposit at the National Library of Scotland."

Beginning in 1914, Parr was elected to the Texas State Senate for numerous consecutive terms, serving nearly two decades, from 1915 to 1934. He had previously been elected as country commissioner, serving for a decade after repeated re-election. He amassed a great fortune through his career. Anglo in ancestry, Parr spoke Spanish and acted as a patron, developing a power base among the Mexican Americans who constituted the majority of residents in the county. He retained their favor by supporting his constituents, showing sensitivity to their customs, and sometimes making cash payments. Parr controlled the party machine in the county. By his death in 1942, his son, George Parr, had taken it over, keeping control until 1975."

  "text" : "Archie Marshek (February 15, 1902 – March 29, 1992) was an American film editor whose 44-year career spanned six decades. He was a staff editor at R.K.O. - Radio Pictures from 1929 to 1936 and at Paramount Pictures from 1937 to 1967. Born in Cass Lake, Minnesota, he started his career at Joseph P. Kennedy's Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) in 1927. When Kennedy formed R.K.O. in 1929 by merging F.B.O. with the Keith-Albee-Orpheum vaudeville theater circuit and striking a deal with David Sarnoff of Radio Corporation of America in order to access his sound technology patents, Marshek moved to the new studio. Marshek was the first editor to cut a three-strip, live-action Technicolor film, the 1934 short La Cucaracha. He also was the first to cut a full-length, three-strip Technicolor feature film, Becky Sharp (1935). He worked with directors King Vidor, Gregory La Cava, Lewis Milestone, Rouben Mamoulian, Frank Tuttle, Jack Smight and the actors Anthony Quinn and Marlon Brando when they made their feature-film directing debuts. He cut films featuring the top stars at Paramount, including Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, and Elvis Presley. Marshek died at the age of 90 in Lawton, Oklahoma."

Variety stated, \"The Acid House makes Trainspotting look like a mild mannered youth comedy.\" Usborne produced the films F*** Sheffield, and Large, a teen comedy directed by Justin Edgar for FilmFour and The Film Consortium. Among Usborne's early films are the award-winning documentaries Johnny Fantastic and Brendan's Boys. Both films were about boxers in Sheffield. Set in his home town of Sheffield, Tales from a Hard City is about four dreamers in search of a break in the Old Steel City. It was financed by Channel 4, Yorkshire Television, La Sept/ARTE, Eurimages and the CNC, and co-produced with JBA in France. A graduate of MEDIA 95’s EAVE programme, Alex attracted European finance for several projects - Tales from a Hard City was 60% financed from mainland Europe and was the first UK project to be awarded Eurimages funding. In March 2012, the UK trade magazine Screen International claimed that Usborne was shooting his next feature film We are the Freaks working with regular director Justin Edgar."

After his death, botanist Jean-Louis Kralik published a catalog of Maille's collections as \"Catalogue Des Reliquiae Mailleanae\" (1869). In 1842 the grass genus Maillea (synonym Phleum, family Poaceae) was named in his honor by Filippo Parlatore. The standard author abbreviation Maille is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

Owing to the presence of a better wrestler - Yogeshwar Dutt - in Dhankar's weight category, he could hardly get a chance to represent India in the events like Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, World Wrestling Championships, Olympic Qualifiers, etc. In 2014, Dhankar moved to the Delhi High Court after the Wrestling Federation of India shortlisted Yogeshwar Dutt for the 2014 Commonwealth Games without conducting trials, but to no avail. In 2015, at the trails for the World Wrestling Championships, Yogeshwar Dutt was able to defeat Dhankar to secure his place in the 65 Kg category of the Freestyle. In 2016, Yogeshwar again defeated Dhankar in the trials of the Asian Olympic qualifiers."

Solomon Professor of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, Director of the Infancy Studies Laboratory at the Center for Molecular & Behavioral Neuroscience (CMBN) and Director of the Carter Center for Neurocognitive Research and Professor of Neuroscience at Rutgers University. In addition, she is a Principal Investigator within the National Science Foundation-funded Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center headquartered at the University of California, San Diego’s Institute for Neural Computation. Dr. Benasich was the first to link early deficits in rapid auditory processing to later impairments in language and cognition, thus demonstrating that the ability to perform fine non-speech acoustic discriminations in early infancy is critically important to, and highly predictive of, language development in typically developing children as well as children at risk for language learning disorders. Her research also suggests that rapid auditory processing ability may be used to identify and remediate infants at highest risk of language delay and impairment regardless of risk status. and she has demonstrated in pilot studies that infants who played a training game developed to encourage them to focus on small aural differences developed more accurate acoustic maps than infants who were not exposed to the same intervention."

He was married to the sister of George II of Abkhazia. Together they had a daughter who was married to Gurgen II of Tao. Ashot was in possession of the important fortified town of Artanuji, which he probably inherited from his elder brother, Gurgen I of Klarjeti. According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus' De Administrando Imperio, Ashot was on bad terms with his son-in-law Gurgen of Tao, who was determined to take Artanuji as his own. Ashot offered to hand the town over to the Byzantines in return for their protection. The Byzantine plenipotentiary, the patrikios Constans fulfilled his mission to confirm Gurgen of Tao as magistros and proceeded to occupy Artanuji with the Chaldian army. The Georgian princes, competing with Ashot, protested and threatened to go over to the Arabs unless it was restored. The emperor Romanos I Lekapenos had to disown Constans's action to pacify them. Ashot the Swift was given back Artanuji, but Gurgen soon captured the town and gave his father-in-law some land in compensation, which also he later annexed. Ashot died in 939 as a refugee at the court of his brother-in-law, George II."

Lakome was most notably behind the uncovering of the Daniel scandal in which Mohammed VI was found to have pardoned, as a gesture \"demonstrating good relations between him and King Juan Carlos of Spain\" a Spanish serial child rapist sentenced to 30 years in Morocco of which he spent only a year and a half. The scandal led to unprecedented spontaneous demonstrations against the Moroccan monarch in early August 2013. On 17 September 2013, Ali Anouzla was arrested in a raid against his home in Rabat, officially for having linked to an El Pais article which contained a video allegedly posted by AQIM and hosted on the website of the Spanish newspaper. He was later charged with \"Knowingly providing material assistance to terrorists acts\". Many observers saw this as a revenge for the Daniel Scandal episode."

  "text" : "Arthur Maning Topp (7 October 1844 – 17 January 1916) was an Australian journalist who helped to establish the Melbourne Review. Topp was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, being the eldest son of the late Samuel Topp, who emigrated to Australia in 1858. His maternal great-grandfather was William Blanchard (1749-1836), for 60 years editor and proprietor of the York Chronicle, and uncle of William Blanchard (1769-1835), the well-known comedian of the Covent Garden Theatre. A. M. Topp was elder brother of Samuel St John Topp. In 1858 Topp, his parents and a brother, Charles, left England for Melbourne, and Arthur Topp completed his education at the Church of England Grammar School, which was just then opened with Dr. John Edward Bromby as Headmaster. Afterwards going into business, he took an active part in establishing the Melbourne Review, of which the first number appeared in January 1876, and for six years was one of the editorial committee. He contributed to this periodical a number of articles, chiefly on political and historical questions. Two of them, \"English Institutions and the Irish Race\", and \"A few more words on the Irish Question\", appeared separately in pamphlet form and attracted a good deal of attention. Topp was a member of the Eclectic Association, fellow members Arthur Patchett Martin, Theodore Fink, Alfred Deakin and David Mickle were his close friends. In 1878, in conjunction with Arthur Patchett Martin, he initiated a movement \"for the purpose of expressing public appreciation of the services of the Bar of Beaconsfield in the settlement of the Eastern Question.\" A public meeting was held in the Melbourne Town Hall on 29 July 1878, at which a resolution to the above effect was carried with enthusiasm, and speeches were delivered by several prominent public men, including James Francis and James Service. An illuminated address also was sent to Lord Beaconsfield (Benjamin Disraeli). In 1880 Topp joined the literary staff of The Age newspaper, and in 1882 that of the Argus, with which he was connected for a number of years. He has contributed extensively to the columns of this paper and to the Australasian. On 17 January 1916 Topp died at South Yarra, survived by his wife Leila Leonora, née Sanders (they married at South Yarra in 1884) and by his two sons."

He is noted for his role in bringing to light the Fodder scam, in which Rs. 940 crores were embezzled in Bihar over many years, and successive chief ministersJagannath Mishra and Lalu Yadav have been imprisoned. In late 1995, Bihar was in a financial crunch and the finance commissioner S Vijay Raghvan had asked the District Magistrates to monitor unusual withdrawals from the district treasury. Khare, who was then district commissioner at Chaibasa, noted that the district animal husbandry department had withdrawn Rs 10 crore and Rs 9 crore twice without giving any details. Even when questioned, there was no response from the animal husbandry department. Finally, in January 1996,Khare visited the office to investigate, and found it looking as if \"someone had tried to destroy files in a hurry\". Many bogus bills were for amounts just under Rs. 10 lakhs (when there are more stringent authorization norms). It seemed that such payments had been going on for years. The next day, simultaneous raids conducted at Ranchi and elsewhere found similar practices. This was the first evidence of the scam, which gathered momentum after regional CBI director U. N. Biswas defied political pressures to pursue the case up to the chief minister level. Those convicted include the preceding DM of Chaibasa, IAS officer Sajal Chakraborty. Khare has interests in Education and has served the State Elementary education secretary for several terms, and has also worked at the Ministry of Human Resource Development at the center. He has also served as principal secretary to Jharkhand governor Ved Marwah, and as Collector and DM, Patna. He is now posted as Principal Secretary (Finance), Government of Jharkhand, Ranchi."

  "text" : "Ann J. Wolpert (October 1, 1943 - October 2, 2013) was a pioneer in digital libraries. As director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries from 1996 to 2013, she was instrumental in a variety of projects, including leading an initiative between MIT and Hewlett Packard to develop the DSpace digital repository system, and supporting MIT OpenCourseWare, one of the earliest large-scale projects to provide open access to university course materials. She also championed MIT's adoption of an open access mandate in 2009, the first of its kind in the United States. She advised and contributed to many core library organizations as well as initiatives that sought to transform the way research institutions and their libraries collaborate to solve large problems. Over her career, she served on the boards of directors of the Boston Library Consortium, the National Academies’ Board of Research Data and Information (BRDI), DuraSpace, and the Digital Preservation Network (DPN); on the steering committee of the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI); as the council chair of the International Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR); and served in significant advisory roles in many other organizations."

  "text" : "Adolfo Bignami (1845–1906) was an Italian painter and engraver. While born and trained in Bologna and Florence, he was linked to the artists in Turin and the Piedmont, including Antonio Fontanesi. He stopped exhibiting by 1877 due to an eye malady. Carlo Felice Biscarra and Luigi Rocca published a monthly journal with engraved works of art titled L'arte in Italia (1869–1873), which used Bignami, along with Telemaco Signorini and N. Costa, as engravers. One of his pupils was Celestino Turletti. He was known for his etchings."

He was raised in a household of scholarly and philosophical interests although neither of his parents were highly educated. He attended University of Missouri for both undergraduate and graduate school and eventually earned his PhD there in 1916. Weiss initially planned on majoring in physics, mathematics, and philosophy until he was inspired by his professor Max Meyer to become a psychologist. After earning his PhD, he went to Ohio State University where he did research and taught up until his death. While in school, Weiss became interested in the physiological and sociological aspects of philosophy. He was interested in the role of language in human behavior and used biology, physics, and chemistry to examine human behaviors. He died of heart disease in 1931."

  "text" : "Ajitesh Bandopadhyay (Bengali: অজিতেশ বন্দোপাধ্যায়; born: 30 September 1933 - October 13, 1983) was an actor, playwright, activist and director. He along with Shambhu Mitra and Utpal Dutt are considered to be the doyens of Bengali theatre of the post - Independence era. He was born Ajit, at Ropogram, in the Asansol region of Bardhaman district, borderingPurulia. He was the eldest son of coal miner Bhubhanmohan and Lakshmirani. Having graduated from Manindra College, Kolkata, he taught for few years in the same college and in South Point School before plunging himself in the world of theatre by joining the Nandikar group in 1960. Prior to this, he had been in close touch with the IPTA (Indian Peoples' Theatre Association) and was both directing and performing a number of its stage productions. While with Nandikar, Ajitesh along with Rudraprasad Sengupta, Asit Mukhopadhyay and Keya Chakrabarty, staged and performed many successful plays - mostly adaptations of Chekhov, Sophocles and such stalwarts; of these, few like Antigone, Teen Poysar Pala (adapted from Three Penny Opera), Manjari Aamer Manjari (adapted from Cherry Orchard) not only drew large audiences but created milestones of success even at the national level. Plays like Bhalomanusher Pala and Sher Afgan met with same success. As a recognition of his directorial ventures and contribution to theatre, he was honoured with the Sangeet Natak Academy award in 1976 at the age of 42, one of the youngest recipients of this nationally prestigious award. In the early 1970s, he was described by none other than Sambhu Mitra as the \"most powerful performer of the Bengal theatre in current times\". In 1977, he left Nandikar and formed his own theatrical group Nandimukh through which he continued his stage productions and performances with equal aplomb. At the same time, his performance on the silver screen, particularly as a character-actor, in films like Haate Bajare, Chhuti, Kuheli, followed by Ganadebata, Aaj Kaal Porshur Galpo, Nidhiram Sardar, Hire Manik, Kapalkundala, Samjhauta (in Hindi) established him as a powerful thespian of the stage and screen. He was actively involved with radio-plays and Jatra also. An instance of his integrity and devotion is found when he left his teaching career on being cast for the role of the antagonist in Haate Bajare (Director : Tapan Sinha) stating that his acting might negatively impact the young minds. His untimely demise (at the age of 50) left a void, especially in Bengal theatre, which is, perhaps, still felt by one and many."

  "text" : "Aaron Scharf (1922 – 1993) was an American-born British art historian who contributed in particular to the history of photography in which he had developed an interest while studying at the Courtauld Institute. His investigation uncovered links between painting (and other artforms) and photography, and evidence for artists using photography for reference and other purposes, as well as the way photographers with aspirations as artists referred to painting in their work. He thus pioneered a new field of art history when Pop Art and other movements in the 1960s were reincorporating the medium of photography (which developed separately since the 1930s, and which hitherto art historians in general treated separately from painting) and reference to popular photographic images, into mainstream artistic practice. Scharf popularised his study and discoveries with publication of his profusely illustrated hardback Penguin volume 'Art and Photography' (1968) and through his work at the Open University in producing innovative thematic educational videos on the history of photography and its relation to society."

His uncle, Benjamin Tonsler, worked as a school principal. He was a driving force in helping Allen Weatherford to take his education as far as he could. Weatherford left home to attend the Hampton institute in Hampton, Virginia. It is there that he earned his bachelor's degree. Allen E. Weatherford then went on to obtain his master's degree, and finally obtained his PhD degree in physical education; the first black man to do so. Weatherford moved to North Carolina, where he married Rebecca Christmas in 1939. They had six children together. Allen E. Weatherford continued to work as a professor at St. Augustine's University; he also worked as Chairman of the Department of Physical Education there. In 1965, Allen E. Weatherford suffered a fatal heart attack, collapsing on the steps of St. Augustine's University. He was buried December 24, 1965, at Mount Hope Cemetery (Raleigh, North Carolina)."

  "text" : "Aleta Baun is an award-winning Indonesian environmental activist. She has been described as the Indonesian Avatar. She won the 2013 Goldman Environmental Prize for organizing hundreds of local villagers to peacefully occupy marble mining sites in “weaving protests,” to stop destruction of sacred forest land on Mutis Mountain on the island of Timor. A leader of indigenous Mollo people, she was born to a family of farmers. Having lost her mother at a young age, she was raised by other women and elders in the village who taught her to respect the environment as a source of their spiritual identity and livelihood. As a community leader sharing traditional knowledge, she eventually became known as “Mama Aleta.” Mama Aleta’s work made her a target for the mining interests and local authorities, who put a price on her head. After surviving an assassination attempt, Mama Aleta went into hiding in the forest with her baby. Despite intimidation, Mama Aleta grew the movement to include hundreds of villagers. It culminated in a weaving occupation where 150 women spent a year sitting on the marble rocks at the mining site, quietly weaving their traditional cloth in protest. Because women were traditionally responsible for getting food, dye and medicine from the mountains, mining in these mountains would have directly impacted their livelihoods. While the women protested at the mine, the men provided domestic support at home, cooking, cleaning and caring for the children. In the face of the villagers’ peaceful and sustained presence, marble mining became an increasingly untenable endeavor for the companies involved. Public awareness of the weaving occupation was growing, and Indonesian government officials took notice. By 2010, the mining companies, reacting to the pressure, halted mining at all four sites within the Mollo territories and abandoned their operations. Mama Aleta now helps communities across West Timor to map their traditional forests. She works in water security and indigenous peoples natural resource management and land rights. She said to the Jakarta Post:“We especially want to conserve the upstream region of our territory because it is a watershed for the entire island. We are considering a joint title for our three communities and placing the land under collective ownership of the communities”."

  "text" : "Attilio Deffenu (28 December 1890 – 16 June 1918) was an Italian journalist, soldier, exponent of Sardinian autonomism and a syndicalist. He was born in 1890 in Nuoro, Sardinia, to parents Giuseppe, a merchant and president of the Società Operaia di Nuoro and Giovanna Sechi, a socialist sympathizer. In 1908, he enrolled in law at the University of Pisa, where he supported anarchist ideologies and sided against the Italian occupation of Libya. He became correspondent for the Giornale d'Italia, engaging actively in political life: joining the revolutionary unionism and, in 1913, fighting against the protectionism customs which favoured factories in Northern Italy and penalized the economy of Southern Italy and the islands. He died on 16 June 1918 in the Battle of the Piave River, under the command of his platoon of the infantry Sassari Mechanized Brigade, and was decorated with a Gold Medal of Military Valour. An armed merchantman of Regia Marina launched in 1929 was named Attilio Deffenu."

It was on his advice that President Fernández de Kirchner decided not to meet holdout bondholder demands to be repaid what they were owed in 2014. The decision was supported by among others the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the G-77 (133 nations), the Council on Foreign Relations, the American Bankers Association, and bondholders whose payments were stopped by the 2014 ruling. Kicillof has been a firm believer in Keynesian economics, and an avid admirer of the Kirchners since his student days when he was a member of the pro-Kirchner youth group La Cámpora and head of the radical student group TNT. A longtime professor of Economic Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires and outspoken critic of the neo-liberal policies of the Kirchners' predecessors, he is known for his unorthodox haircut and dress code, signifying his anti-establishment views."

Secrets of Secrets was hailed by The East Bay Express as \"enticing\" and \"ferociously executed\" and by The Jewish Week as \"richly textured and eclectic avant-klez\" for its use of the 13th century sacred Kabbalah texts of Rabbi Eleazar of Worms.

  "text" : "Anne Margrethe Qvitzow (1652 -1700) was a Danish poet, translator and memoir writer, known for her learning. Qvitzow was the daughter of the noble officer Erik Qvitzow (1616–78) and Susanne Juel (d. 1685) and married in 1676 to the noble Christian von Pappenheim (d. 1705). She was given an unusually high education: at this time, female members of the Danish nobility were normally barely taught to read and write. However, as showed herself to be very gifted early on, her parents hired private teachers to educate her in Danish, German, Latin, Greek, French, grammar, logic, rhetoric, geometry, astronomy, arithmetic, musical science, and also begun studies in Hebrew. She translated De officiis by Cicero and De bello gallico by Julius Caesar. In 1676, Qvitzow married. Reportedly, her spouse wasted their fortune, and after 1685, when she wrote a poem dedicated the memory of Ove Rosenkrantz Axelsen, she is no longer heard of, and her late life is not much known. During the 1670s and 1680s, however, she was a celebrity. Erik Pontoppidan called her “Heroina longe eruditissima” and compared her to Anna Maria van Schurman. In 1673, Qvitzow rejected the idea that her learning should be considered in any way remarkable because of her sex, and stated that if women were given the same education as men, they would prove themselves to be just as capable. Qvitzow was included in contemporary dictionaries and work of female scholars and learned women, gynæcéer, by Matthias Schacht, Albert Thura and Fr. Chr. Schønau."

In his early amateur career Patterson was boxing for England. He had a total of 67 fights and lost only 7. Patterson won a multi-nations tournament in Cyprus.

Patterson currently resides in Dulwich with his wife, Daina 'Tootsie' Clarke. The pair have been together for 3 years and married since April 2013.

  "text" : "Alwyn Machen (1901–1 March 1960) was a British trade union leader. Born into a coal mining family in Derbyshire, Machen left school and began working as a coal miner at the age of thirteen. He continued his education at the Chesterfield Labour College, and soon began to lecture personally at the college. He joined the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), and through this role, helped organise a major demonstration in London in 1925, where he heard Herbert Smith and A. J. Cook speak, becoming a supporter of the two miners' leaders. Following the UK general strike, Machen struggled to find work, but eventually gained employment at a colliery in Thorne in Yorkshire. There, he joined the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), and rapidly rose through its ranks, first within his local union branch, then in 1945 becoming the regional Compensation Agent. In this role, he became well-known, and wrote a book on the Industrial Injuries Act. In 1952, he was elected as President of the Yorkshire Miners' Association. A member of the Labour Party, Machen was elected as a councillor on the West Riding of Yorkshire County Council, and also on Thorne Rural District Council.. Machen first stood for the post of President of the National Union of Mineworkers (successor to the MFGB) in 1945, coming second to Will Lawther. He stood again in 1960, but died suddenly at the start of March. The count for the presidential election was completed a few days later, showing that he had been posthumously elected to the position."

  "text" : "Ashotan I (Georgian: აშოთან I მუხრანბატონი, Ashot'an I Mukhranbatoni) (died 1561) was a Georgian tavadi (\"prince\") of the House of Mukhrani, a collateral branch of the royal Bagrationi dynasty, and a co-prince (batoni) of Mukhrani from 1539 to 1561. Ashotan was a son of Bagrat I, son of Constantine II of Georgia, by his wife Elene. After the resignation of Bagrat in 1539, Ashotan acceded as co-prince with his elder brother Vakhtang I. At the same time, he was commander of the Banner of Shida Kartli, one of the key provinces of the Kingdom of Kartli, a successor of the Kingdom of Georgia ruled by his royal cousins. Ashotan followed the tradition of the Georgian royals of patronizing the Iviron monastery on Mount Athos. A refectory at the Iviron commissioned by Ashotan housed the tomb of Catholicos Nicholas V of Georgia. During the Safavid invasion of Georgia in 1554, Ashotan joined his brothers, Vakhtang and Archil, in their refuge at the court of their sister, Dedisimedi, in Samtskhe. Back to his demesne, Ashotan successfully defended Mukhrani against the attack by the highlanders of Pkhovi in 1561, but he himself died in the battle. The identity of Ashotan's wife is not known, but he had a daughter, Ketevan (c. 1560 – 13 September 1624), who was married to King David I of Kakheti. She was tortured to death at the order of Shah Abbas I of Persia for having refused to convert to Islam and was subsequently canonized as a saint by the Georgian Orthodox Church."

Archil was a son of Bagrat I, Prince of Mukhrani, son of Constantine II of Georgia, by his wife Elene. After Bagrat's resignation, Archil's elder brothers, Ashotan and Vakhtang, succeeded as princes of Mukhrani. Archil was actively involved in contemporary war and politics. During the Safavid invasion of Georgia in 1554, Archil joined his brothers in their exile at the court of their sister, Dedisimedi, in Samtskhe. Back to Kartli, Archil was allied with his cousin, King Simon I of Kartli, and perpetually challenged the Safavid control of Tbilisi, the capital of Kingdom of Kartli, frequently raiding the city's environs. In one of such forays, a Safavid force from the Tbilisi citadel assaulted and defeated Archil at Sapurtsle. The prince and his family were captured and sent to Iran. After Simon I himself was brought captive to the shah Tahmasp I and cast in the Alamut fortress, Archil and his family were imprisoned in Shiraz in 1573. Both Simon and Archil were released on the death of Tahmasp and returned to Kartli in 1576. Archil once again visited his sister in Samtskhe and died in that principality, at Atskuri, on 25 November 1582. Archil had three children: \n*  Prince Erekle (29 March 1560 – 1605), Prince of Mukhrani. \n*  Prince Husayn Beg. His son, Bakhuta, was killed on the order of Rostom of Kartli. \n*  Princess Elene (fl. 1572)."

  "text" : "Alfred J. R. E. Zucker (January 23, 1852, Freiburg, Silesia – August 2, 1913, Buenos Aires, Argentina) was a successful German-American architect, who worked in Galveston, Texas, Mississippi, New York City, and Buenos Aires. Alfred Zucker was born on January 23, 1852 in the town of Freiburg, Silesia, Prussia (since 1945 Świebodzice, Poland). He was educated at the Hannover Polytechnische Schule and the Bauakademie. He worked briefly for the government before immigrating to the United States in 1872, arriving at New York. From 1873 to 1876 he worked in the Office of the Supervising Architect, in Washington, D.C. In 1877, Zucker relocated to the coastal city of Galveston. There, he became the partner of John Moser (1832-1904), an architect who moved there from Toledo, Ohio. Zucker married Moser's sister, Augusta Moser. She died in 1878 in the yellow fever epidemic. Zucker then left to establish a branch office of the firm in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The partnership lasted until 1880, when Moser relocated to Atlanta. By virtue of the firm's design for the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College at Starkville, Zucker was appointed State Architect of Mississippi. Due to his poor health, Zucker resigned from his position in 1882 and returned to Europe. The following year, he returned to New York and found work in the office of noted architect Henry Fernbach. Upon Fernbach's death that same year, Zucker founded the firm of Alfred Zucker & Company, with John R. Hinchman as his partner. This association lasted until 1889, after which both Zucker and Hinchman practiced alone. From 1891 to 1893 Zucker employed John H. Edelmann as a designer in his office. Edelmann is known to have designed full buildings for Zucker, most prominently the Decker Building. Edelmann left after 1893, but his work inspired Zucker's later designs until at least 1901. After 1896, there was less and less work in Zucker's office. As a cost-saving measure, in 1897 he made several employees partners in the firm. These former employees received a fraction of the payments from each design executed, relieving Zucker of the worries of regular wages. Near the end of his American career, Zucker was associated with J. Riely Gordon, a noted architect of public buildings. Gordon was the probable designer of Zucker's Wilkinson County Courthouse in Woodville, Mississippi, which follows Gordon's standard plan. It was his association with Gordon that ended Zucker's American career. In 1904 he fled with his family to Buenos Aires. His goal was to avoid a \"$100,000 suit filed by Gordon, who alleged fraud and misrepresentation\". He would have a successful practice in Buenos Aires, dying there in 1913. He would remarry, to Jennie Nace Brooke (1861-1959). He is buried in the Cementerio de la Chacarita, in the British section."

He was a specialist in French and German literature and also an accomplished translator for several European languages, mainly German, French and Italian, translating, among other things, choral works set by his colleague at Newcastle, W G Whittaker. In 1910/11, he was appointed as the first full professor of Modern Languages, leading to Centenary Celebrations at the School of Modern Languages at Newcastle in 2011. Latham's target audience were lay readers. Latham’s publications included The Oxford Treasury of French Literature. His translation of Goethe's Faust for the Everyman's Library edition was the one most English-speaking readers in the first half of the twentieth century would have been familiar with. He retired in 1926."

  "text" : "Archie Lewis (10 April 1918– 29 February 1988) was a Jamaican singer who was popular in Britain in the 1940s. Archie Lewis sang in choirs and was a Sunday school teacher before taking up singing as a career. Already one of the most popular singers in Jamaica, he migrated to Britain in 1942 to work in a munitions factory as part of the war effort, and became the featured singer with Geraldo and his Orchestra, with whom he recorded. He also appeared regularly on BBC radio. He had a \"rich baritone voice\" and specialised in romantic ballads. He was one of the first black vocalists to sing solo in public performances in England, and toured widely with Geraldo and with Josephine Baker, as well as performing at the London Palladium and at a Royal Command Performance. For a time he was seen as one of Britain's most popular singers, and was known as \"the Crosby of the Caribbean\". His version of \"In the Land of Beginning Again\", recorded in 1946, was one of the most popular songs of its time, and his recording of \"While the Angelus Was Ringing\", sung with the Luton Girls Choir in 1948, was reported to have sold over a million copies. After some time in Germany, Lewis returned to Jamaica in 1964 and performed in the island's leading hotels and clubs. In 1967, he was reported as being about to tour in Canada and the United States. He recorded three albums in Jamaica in the late 1960s and early 1970s: The Voice of Love, In Jamaica, and I'll Remember Jamaica. He died in the University Hospital, Mona, Jamaica, in 1988 at the age of 69."

Albarrassah is the largest tribe in Libya. It is well known in Libya as many of the Albarrassah tribe defended Libya in many wars over three centuries. They were top fighters with Libya's Omar Mukhtar against the Italians. Many of members of the Albarassah were killed defending Libya during the Italian invasion. Dictator Muammar Gaddafi was married to Safia Farkash Albarrasey, a nurse who was from the Albarrassah tribe to win over the Barrassah. People from the Barrassah tribe knew Gaddafi's tricks and they rejected him for 42 years. Gaddafihas jailed and killed large number of Albarrassah tribe members. Yet the Barrassah never gave in to Gaddafi. Albarrassah were a huge part of freeing Libya in the Libyan Civil War on February 17, 2011 when Gaddafi wasremoved. Some say the Barrassah population number is at least around 900,000 members mostly on the Eastern part of Libya. Somealso live outside of Libya in exile. Libya's population is nearly 7 million."

  "text" : "Hannam Edward Albany Ward (6 November 1879 – 18 February 1966), known as Albany Ward, was a pioneer English theatre proprietor and cinema developer, who ran one of the largest cinema circuits in Britain in the early part of the twentieth century. He was born Hannam Edward Bonnor in Stoke Newington, London, the youngest son of William Bonnor, a surgeon originally from Hereford, and his wife Emma. He was educated at Christ's Hospital. After leaving school he joined his widowed mother in Ilfracombe, Devon, before starting work in 1896 as an assistant to pioneer filmmaker Birt Acres in High Barnet. He then joined the Velograph Company, managed by Adolphe Langfier, as a projectionist, and began touring the country with films of such events as Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. In 1898 he formed his own company and toured Wales and the south-west of England, becoming the first moving picture exhibitor in parts of the country. He introduced offstage sound effects, such as imitations of train and battle noises, to accompany the film showings. He opened his first theatre, the Empire Theatre in Oxford, in 1900, showing a mixture of films and variety acts. By 1901 he was referring to himself simply as Albany Ward, with no forenames, and described himself as \"Theatrical manager\". He established his first permanent theatre, in Weymouth, Dorset, in 1906. The town became his main base and residence. He built up one of the largest circuits of cinemas in the country, owning 29 cinemas by 1914, mostly in small towns in the west of England and south Wales. In some cases, as at Exeter, Warminster and Monmouth, he took over and refurbished existing theatres; elsewhere, as at Chepstow, he had a new theatre built. He sold his cinema and theatre chain to Provincial Cinematograph Theatres Ltd. (PCT) in 1920, while retaining management responsibilities for them as part of PCT. He formally changed his surname from Bonnor to Albany Ward by deed poll in 1922. He married Edith Robertson in 1899. He married again in 1916, to Dorothy Hembrow; they had four children. He died in a nursing home in Torquay, Devon, in 1966 at the age of 86."
