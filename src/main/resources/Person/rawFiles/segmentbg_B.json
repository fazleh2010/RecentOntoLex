  "text" : "John Bruce Hamilton (2 April 1901 – 11 April 1968) was an Australian ophthalmologist. He was born in Hobart to merchant Clyde Hamilton and Beatrice Lilian, née Paxton. He attended Leslie House School in Hobart before studying at the University of Sydney, where he received a Bachelor of Medicine in 1924. After studying ophthalmic medicine in England at the Royal College of Physicians and Oxford University (1928–29), he returned to Tasmania to set up his own practice. He was also honorary or consulting ophthalmic surgeon to the Royal Hobart Hospital, the Queen Alexandra Hospital for Women and the Royal Tasmanian Society for the Blind and Deaf. In 1937, Hamilton and Dr W. D. Counsell presented a paper on hereditary eye disease and proposed remedies to the National Health and Medical Research Council, which was awarded the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital's Gifford Edmunds prize. In 1940 he published A Guide to Ophthalmic Operations. Hamilton had joined the Australian Medical Corps in 1935 and was appointed a major in the Australian Imperial Force on 4 January 1941. He served in the Middle East as ophthalmic surgeon for the 2nd/7th Australian General Hospital, before returning to Australia and leaving the AIF on 1 November 1943. He married Dora Jessie Grant at Hobart on 21 April 1943. Also in 1943, he re-issued a 1933 paper by Henrik Sjögren, with his own foreword, and his own study of conjunctivitis, The Significance of Heredity in Ophthalmology — A Tasmanian Survey (1951) earned him a doctorate from the University of Sydney. He had been a fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons since 1931 and served as state chairman, and was otherwise active in the field as president of the British Medical Association's Tasmanian branch (1948), a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine, a member of the Australian Medical Association, a life member of the Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom, and president of the Ophthalmological Society of Australia. He was also a member of the Liberal Party of Australia, contesting the Senate for the party in 1943 and the seat of Denison in 1946. Hamilton, known for being a perfectionist and for having \"a very real belief in himself and his abilities\", died of hypertensive heart disease on 11 April 1968 at Sandy Bay. He was cremated."

  "text" : "Butana Almond Nofomela (born 1957) was a former Vlakplaas security policeman, and once one of South Africa's most brutal killers. Former apartheid Askari was released from the Pretoria Central Prison on parole after he had served 22 years of a life sentence. Nofomela was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1988 after being convicted of the murder of farmer Johannes Lourens. On the evening of 19 October 1989, Nofomela made a confession from his death row cell, just hours before he was due to go to the gallows. He told horrific tales of torture and murder that took place at the notorious Vlakplaas police farm. Thirty-two-year-old Nofomela was on death row in Pretoria awaiting execution for killing a white farmer. Hours before he was scheduled to hang on 20 October 1989, Nofomela announced that he had information to disclose about his membership in a death squad operated by the South African Security Police. His execution was stayed for an investigation into his allegations. Nofomela applied for amnesty in respect of the Chesterville incident of June 1986. He received amnesty for the killing of eight anti-apartheid activists, including human rights lawyer, Griffiths Mxenge in 1981. Nofomela said he served with a police assassination squad that killed and terrorized opponents of apartheid, since 1980. Nofomela identified a retired captain in the security police, Dirk Coetzee as his old commander. Coetzee, who was hiding in Europe, confirmed that he had led one of five \"hit squads\" run out of a restricted police base at Vlakplaas near Pretoria. Nofomela said he was one of seven men who raided a suspected safe house of members of the ANC in Swaziland late in 1983, using a hand grenade and automatic weapons. He said that he accidentally shot one of the other raiders, Jeff Bosego in the ankle. Nofomela said, in another affidavit, that in November 1981, he helped kill Griffiths Mxenge, a Durban lawyer said to have links to the outlawed African National Congress, and made the murder appear as a robbery. He also said that Captain Coetzee had told him he might be needed to kill the victim’s wife, Victoria Mxenge; she was shot and axed to death in August 1985. Coetzee's, Tshikalange's and Nofomela's statements all corroborated one another. Nofomela said he knew about an incident in Lamontville in which a police hit squad killed some guerillas of the ANC in late 1985. John Dugard, a law professor at the University of the Witwatersrand, said an identical incident occurred in Chesterville in 1986 in which four members of a youth organization were slain. In a rare interview whilst in prison, Nofomela openly reflected on how his life has changed, \"Prison has been a blessing in disguise, I’m remorseful, but my eyes have been opened. I appeal to all those I’ve wronged to forgive me.\""

He teamed with Earl Gillespie to give Milwaukee a radio broadcasting team that ranked with the best ever.\" He also worked with Gillespie at Green Bay, broadcasting Green Bay Packers and Wisconsin Badgers football games, and hosted a weekly program with legendary Packers coach Vince Lombardi. After Walsh was forced out as WTMJ announcer in 1961, he stayed with the Braves as a television announcer, then returned to WTMJ as their radio announcer in 1964. Bud Selig commented on Walsh, \"When we were struggling to bring baseball back to Milwaukee after the Braves went to Atlanta, there wasn't anything in the world he wouldn't do for us. You couldn't meet a finer man.\" Blaine Walsh's grandson, Dave Garner, is sports director for ETC3 television in Ellijay, Georgia. His father was Samuel P. Walsh who served in the Wisconsin State Assembly. Walsh served in the United States Army in Europe during World War II. Walsh died September 5, 1985, in Sandy Springs, Georgia."

  "text" : "Bellerose or Belle-Rose (1592 – 1670) was the stage name of the French actor and theatre manager Pierre le Messier. He was one of the leading tragedians of the first half of the 17th century. He apprenticed with Valleran le Conte in 1609, performed in Bourges in 1619, and directed his own company in Marseille in 1620, but little else is known about his early career. He joined the Comédiens du Roi under Gros-Guillaume at the Hôtel de Bourgogne in 1622. He had a fine speaking voice and performed leading parts in comedies and tragedies, and also acted as the 'orator', the member of the company who formally addressed the audience. Some contemporaries regarded Bellerose as \"insipid and affected\" and preferred his arch-rival, the more aggressive Montdory at the Théâtre du Marais. After Gros-Guillaume's death in 1634, Bellerose became the leader of the Comédiens du Roi at the Bourgogne and remained in that position until 1647, when he is thought to have sold his interest in the company for a very high price to his brother-in-law Floridor."

  "text" : "Bartolomeo Fanfulla's parents, Domenico Alon and Angela Folli, gave him multiple names: Giovanni or Giovanni Battista (in honour of the Evangelical preacher), Bartolomeo (in honour of Bartolomeo Colleoni) and Tito (in honour of the great Roman emperor). Born in the province of Lodi (but for Guicciardini he is allegedly from Parma), Fanfulla almost certainly died 24 February 1525 in the battle of Pavia. He had at least four children (Marc’Antonio, Ambrosio, Giorgio and Domenico) and nine grandchildren. He was first a soldier of fortune, then knight and finally captain of a flag between 1499 and 1525.They say of him: There is no important battle fought across the 16th century in which Fanfulla did not fight, first as simple soldier of fortune and then as Captain of a flag (Alfiere) with his Lanza of fifty armed men directly reporting to him and paid by him— Pietro Novati, Fanfulla da Lodi, Edizioni Lodigraf, 1982 In his life he fought on the side of Florence (1499), Spain (from 1503) and empire (from 1515) having as enemies Pisa (in 1499) and France (from 1503 onwards). Together with Ettore Fieramosca he was the main character of the famous battle of Barletta, which on 13 February 1503 saw thirteen Italian warriors fight against the same number of Frenchmen. Having remained horseless (together with Giovanni Bracalone) during the fight, he fought on foot killing the horses of the French jousters. At the end of the battle, he was knighted by the Spanish potestà (chief magistrate) Consalvo di Cordoba.He is one of the main characters of the novel Ettore Fieramosca o La disfida di Barletta (1833), by the politician and man of letters Massimo d'Azeglio, in which the author's phantasy introduces him as an astute, fun and jolly man. The resulting colourful portrait of heroic soldier of fortune gave Fanfulla his fame. Fanfulla is considered one of the symbols of the town of Lodi and of its territory, so much so that a number of local sports clubs take inspiration from his figure: among the most awarded there is the A.S.Ginnastica e Scherma Fanfulla 1874, l'Atletica Fanfulla and the Associazione Calcio Fanfulla 1874. Moreover, the biscuits Amaretti Fanfullini, a typical product of Lodi, owe their name to him. A famous Italian goliardic song from the 20th century has been also dedicated to Fanfulla: Fanfulla da Lodi. In the city of Lecce, bronze statue of him by the Italian sculptor Antonio Bortone from Ruffano is found in the square Raimondello Orsini."

  "text" : "Ballomar (AD 140 – AD 170-180) was a leader of the Marcomanni during the Marcomannic Wars. Ballomar is first mentioned by Cassius Dio as conducting peace talks with the governor of Pannonia Superior, Marco Iallio Basso Fabio Valeriano, following the breakthrough of the limes by his allies the Germanic Lombards and Ubii. Ballomar led the great invasion of Italy by a coalition of Germanic tribes in 167-70 AD, which was the first time a hostile force had entered Italy since the Cimbri of Boiorix during the Cimbrian War. Ballomar defeated a force of 20,000 Roman soldiers near Carnontum, destroyed Opitergium (Oderzo) and besieged Aquilea. Ballomar might be the character on episode XXV on the Column of Marcus Aurelius, who surrenders on behalf of the Marcomannic to Marcus Aurelius. The dating of this episode is around 172 AD."

Martin Gardner wrote that Reese was an expert mentalist no different from stage magicians of the period such as Joseph Dunninger but managed to fool a number of people into believing he was a genuine psychic. Thomas Edison was duped by the billet reading tricks of Reese and claimed him to be a real psychic. This led The New York Times journalist Edward Marshall to write two articles in November, 1910 exposing with illustrations how Reese performed his tricks. The magician Joseph Rinn revealed the billet reading tricks of Reese. The most detailed account at exposing his tricks (with diagrams) was by the magician Theodore Annemann."

  "text" : "Stirling Henry Nahum (1906 - September 1956), or Sterling Henry Nahum (sources differ), known professionally as Baron, was a society and court photographer in the United Kingdom. He was born in England of Italian Jewish heritage. Having embarked on a career as a photographer, in his thirties he began to find prominence for his pictures of the ballet, and was often found at the Sadler's Wells ballet company. After the war he concentrated on society and celebrity portraits. A friend of Prince Philip he was appointed a Court Photographer to the British Royal Family, and took the official photographs for many occasions such as the wedding of Philip to Princess Elizabeth in 1947, the christenings of their children Charles and Anne and other occasions. Put forward in 1953 by Prince Philip to provide the official photographs of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, he was to be disappointed. The appointment of Cecil Beaton was preferred by the Queen Mother The following year, he founded Baron Studios on Park Lane in London's Mayfair, taking commissioned portraits by photographers including Theodore Zichy and Rex Coleman mainly of leading businessmen. However, one notable sitter was Marilyn Monroe, whom in 1954 he went to California to photograph in an outdoor shoot. After only two years of this new venture, however, Baron died at the age of 50, although his studio continued for a further two decades before being sold off in 1974. The Studio's photograph collection was donated to the National Portrait Gallery in 1999."

  "text" : "Barbara \"Bobbie\" Lucille Banda (c. 1947 – May 4, 2013) was an American Juaneño tribal elder, activist, and a member of the Juaneño Band of Mission Indians. Banda successfully championed efforts to introduction Native American curriculum, including Juaneño language courses, into the public school systems around San Juan Capistrano, California, during the 1970s. The curriculum is still taught in California public schools today. Banda was a ninth generation member of the Rios family. The Rio family has lived in the area since before the establishment of the Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1776. Banda was raised in the Little Hollywood neighborhood, located within San Juan Capistrano's Los Rios Street Historic District. She attended the city's San Juan Elementary School. Banda was a member of the now defunct Capistrano Union High School class of 1964, which was the last class to graduate from the high school. Banda was hired by the Capistrano Unified School District as a teacher's aide immediately after her high school graduation. She later worked for Endevco Aerospace for twenty-eight years. Bobbie Banda actively campaigned for the creation of Native American courses and programs at the Capistrano Unified School District during the 1970s. She successfully lobbied for U.S. federal funding to establish the educational programs. The programs created by Banda represented a major step toward Native American education in Southern California. The programs, led by her son, Nathan Banda, are still taught as part of the curicullum today. Banda was active in Juaneño politics as well. She served as the co-director of the Juaneño Band of Mission Indians' eldersc committee for six years, until her death in May 2013. In 2013, Banda campaigned on behalf of the six candidates for the Juaneño tribal council. All six candidates endorsed by Banda were elected, leading to the first all female tribal council in Juaneño history. Bobbie Banda died from a series of strokes on May 4, 2013, at the age 66. She was survived by her husband, Frank, whom she had been married to for 48 years, as well as their four children - Frank Jr., Monica Clifton, Erika Zammoron and Nathan. Her funeral was held at the Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano."

  "text" : "Bartolomeo degli Erri (1447–1482) was an Italian Gothic painter of the Italian Renaissance. Bartolomeo degli Erri, and his brothers Bartolomeo Bonascia and Agnolo are considered key figures of the Quattrocento movement in Modena. Bartolomeo probably contributed to the large triptych of the Coronation of the Virgin at the Galleria Estense (1462 and 1466) mainly attributed to his brother. The art historian Roberto Longhi also assigns a secondary interest to a series of paintings of scenes from the lives of the saints. There are tables that are probably from three dismembered altarpieces dedicated to the saints, made between 1466-1474 for the church of San Domenico Modena. He also has works in various museums worldwide, including Metropolitan Museum of Art, Kunsthistorisches Museum, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, and the Galleria Estense."

In addition to his live performances, he has recorded repeatedly for several labels, including Sony, EMI, Teldec, Virgin, and Deutsche Harmonia Mundi, specialising in the keyboard repertoire of the 16th - 18th centuries, such as the harpsichord works of Froberger, J. S. Bach and Handel. One of the most important discography projects he has undertaken is the complete keyboard works of C.P.E. Bach and also the complete sonatas of Catalan composer Antonio Soler (Astrée, 1992). Various other projects are under way, while many of his recordings have been awarded with prestigious prizes, such as the Preis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik and the Diapason d'Or. Bob van Asperen has taught at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague and the Sweelinck Conservatory in Amsterdam, while for the past thirty years he has been giving master-classes in Europe, USA and elsewhere. In addition to his teaching activities, he has also contributed as a musicologist and editor of several modern editions of works by J. S.

  "text" : "Ben E. Rich (1855–1913) was a leading missionary and spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the early 20th-century. He was also a publisher, novelist, and an active participant in politics. Rich was the son of Charles C. Rich and his wife Sarah D. Pea. He first served as a missionary for the LDS Church in Great Britain from 1881 until 1883. For part of this time he oversaw the emigration of Church members from Britain to the United States. He worked as a salesman for Z.C.M.I and then as a store manager for the Goden Equitable Co-operative Store. In 1893 he moved to Rexburg, Idaho where he owned and operated the Rexburg Press, later renamed the Silver Hammer and relocated to St. Anthony, Idaho. Rich also wrote the novel Mr. Durant of Salt Lake City: That Mormon. Rich was a leading Republican and an associate of Theodore Roosevelt. In 1898 he was made president of the Southern States Mission. When the mission was divided two years later, Rich continued as president of the newly formed Middle States Mission based in Washington, D.C. Upon the death of the president of the Southern States Mission, the Middle States Mission was dissolved and Rich was again assigned to preside over the Southern States Mission. In 1908, he was assigned to the Eastern States Mission, serving there as its president until the time of his death in 1913. As mission president in these areas, he was at the forefront of evangelizing the LDS Church during the Reed Smoot hearings and was involved in several highly publicized debates with leading Protestant preachers, most notably his debate with A. A. Bunner of the Church of Christ. Rich also authored a number of missionary tracts, often drawing on his experience with opposition to the Church, including calls often made by Protestant ministers to forcibly drive out the missionaries."

She participated in heat one against three other swimmers Mariam Pauline Keita of Mali, 14-year-old Doli Akhter of Bangladesh, and Pamela Girimbabazi of Rwanda. With one swimmer casting out of the race for a no false-start rule (Akhter), and the other for an illegal turn (Girimbabazi), Ouhoumoudou raced to the second seed in a time of 1:42.39, the slowest ever in the heats.

  "text" : "Betty Margaret Burstall (4 February 1926 – 14 June 2013) was an Australian theatre director who founded the La Mama Theatre in Melbourne in 1967. Burstall and her theatre are credited with leading the growth of contemporary theatre in Melbourne during the 1960s and 1970s. Burstall was inspired to establish the theatre after returning from New York City. She introduced off-Broadway contemporary theatre to Melbourne through La Mama. Numerous actors and writers have appeared and worked at La Mama, including Graeme Blundell, Kerry Dwyer, Jack Hibberd, and John Romeril, all of whom formed the Australian Performing Group. In 1976, Burstall turned over the day-to-day operations of La Mama to Liz Jones, who remains the theatre's artistic director as of 2013. Burstall remained the chief script adviser until about 1998. Betty Burstall died on 14 June 2013, at the age of 87. Her late husband, film director Tim Burstall, died in 2004. She was survived by two sons and their wives, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. The actress Sigrid Thornton is her daughter-in-law."

He converted to Christianity after an American teacher gave him a biography of a Chinese Christian convert. After his studies, Fu taught English at the Central Party School in Beijing while participating in the house church movement. In 1996, Bob Fu and his family emigrated to Hong Kong and then the United States, after his wife became pregnant without the government permission to have a child. Fu founded the China Aid Association in Philadelphia in 2002, but moved its headquarters to Midland, Texas in 2004. Fu is also known for his role in helping negotiate barefoot lawyer Chen Guangcheng's immigration to the United States; in this sense, has been described as a \"liaison\" between oppressed groups in China and foreign governments or media that can help them."

  "text" : "Barak Feldman (Hebrew: ברק פלדמן, born July 27, 1972) is an Israeli songwriter, known especially for his collaboration with Yoni Bloch and Efrat Gosh. Feldman grew up in Omer and began writing songs at the age of ten as a hobby, while he made a living out of electrical engineering. He posted his songs in \"Bama Hadasha\", a website that give Israeli writers a chance to present their lyrics. Via Bama Hadsha, Feldman knew Yoni Bloch, after he heard his songs in the site. One of the first songs the pair produced together was \"Makir Oto\" (Hebrew: מכיר אותו, English translation: Know Him), that Feldman initially wrote as a short story . Feldman wrote most of the songs Bloch's first album, \"Ulay Ze Ani\" (Hebrew: אולי זה אני, English translation: Maybe it's Me) that was released in 2004. Part of them are \"Hetkef Lev Katan\" (Hebrew: התקף לב קטן, English translation: Little Heart Attack), \"Ha'psichologit\" (Hebrew: הפסיכולוגית, English translation: The Psychologist), \"Makir Oto\" and Tapuzim (Hebrew: \"תפוזים\", English translation: Oranges). Most of these songs were published prior the album's release, with different arrangements, at \"Bama Hadasha\" website. Yoni and Barak later met the singer Efrat Gosh and created an album for her. Except for one song, Feldman wrote all the album's songs, and Bloch wrote all the melodies. Among them \"Always when you come\" (Hebrew: תמיד כשאתה בא), \"Diet,\" \"Good Alone,\" \"Georgia\" and more. On Bloch's second album, \"Bad Habits\" which was published in 2007, Feldman was the primary author, including writing the songs: \"responsibility\", \"different views\" and \"A reason to leave. In the same year Efrat Gosh published her second album, \"Forgiveness and I\", which Feldman wrote several songs, including \"see the light\" which become her most famous song. Cooperation between Feldman and Bloch continued in Bloch's third album, \"Who am I kidding,\" published in 2008. Barak wrote many of the lyrics as well as scripts for many of the music videos. Barak wrote number of other artists songs, most of Bloch's melodies. Among other things, he wrote the opening songs of the TV shows: \"Michaela\" (\"Fly\"), \"Our Song\" (\"Soon\"), \"pajamas\" (\"pajama party\" with Ilan Rosenfeld), \"Pick Up \"(\"Far Away\"),\"Danny Hollywood\"(\" Everything you dreamed of\") and for \"On the fingertips\" (\"I do not know\").

  "text" : "Brent W. Jeffs is an author, advocate and member of the influential Jeffs family in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church). Jeffs wrote the memoir Lost Boy along with author Maia Szalavitz, which was released on May 19, 2009. The book is a depiction of life within the FLDS Church and his ostracism from the organization at a young age. The title of the book comes from the term \"the lost boys\", which refers to the many young men expelled from the FLDS Church. Jeffs is grandson to FLDS prophet Rulon Jeffs, nephew to FLDS prophet Warren Jeffs, and his mother is the daughter of another non-FLDS prophet as well. Jeffs was born to Ward Jeffs, son of Rulon Jeffs. Ward had three wives, two of which were sisters. Between these marriages, Brent had nineteen siblings. Ward eventually left the church, leaving Brent in the FLDS community per Brent's request. Eventually, Brent left the compound and moved into a small apartment with four of his older brothers, where they experimented with alcohol, drug use and partying. In 2004 Jeffs named Warren Jeffs in a civil lawsuit seeking damages for sexual abuse he had suffered as a boy. Lost Boy depicts much of the sexual abuse that was inflicted upon him beginning at ages 5 or 6. The memoir also includes abuse from Warren's brothers and other family members. Jeffs has appeared on NPR, the television show Polygamy: What Love Is This?, Hannity and Dr. Phil, with each appearance having to do with the FLDS and polygamy. In each appearance Jeffs discusses the dangers of the FLDS lifestyle and abuse from Warren Jeffs and other influential FLDS Church leaders. Since releasing his memoir, Jeffs has married and had a daughter. They live in Salt Lake City, Utah."

In 1787 he moved from Correggio to Turin where he resided for nine years, and in 1796 he accompanied the Duchess Gherardini to Venice, where he remained until 1799. He lived in Paris in 1810 in the service of the Empress Marie Louise, and remained there until the fall of the empire, when he returned to his native town."

  "text" : "Bartolomeo Bortolazzi (born Toscolano-Maderno 1773; died 1820) was a performing musician, composer, author, and virtuoso of both the guitar and the mandolin. He was credited by music historian Philip J. Bone as helping to pull the mandolin out of decline. The mandolin has risen and fallen in its popularity since its invention in the 1730s or 1740s. The instrument went into decline in the early 19th Century, and that decline was commented on by Salvador Leonardi, who was writing for the instrument when it was becoming popular again around 1880. According to Bone, Bortolazzi's playing inspired people to take up the instrument and for music to be written for it. \"This artist, by his extraordinary talent, produced the most wonderful and unheard-of nuances of tone and charms of expression, at that time deemed scarcely possible on so small an instrument. Instead of the monotonous, nasal tone which had hitherto been produced he so manipulated the strings and plectrum that he opened an enlarged sphere of capabilities for the instrument. It is to Bortolazzi that we are indebted for the first revival of the mandolin as a popular instrument, a popularity which lasted for about thirty years and caused most of the great musicians of that time to compose for it.\" Bortolazzi was born to musical parents, and when quite a child studied the mandolin. At a very early age he made concert tours through northern Italy, meeting with considerable success. In the year 1800, he visited England where he was well received, remaining there two years and surprising the English audiences with his instrument. In the beginning of the year 1801 Bortolazzi commenced the study of the guitar, and so great was his natural ability that the next year he was performing and teaching this instrument also, to the elite of London society. Whilst residing in London he composed many works for voices and guitar, and piano and guitar, dedicating one of the latter compositions to his pupil, the Duchess of York this being published by Monzani & Hill, London. He left London n 1803, touring professionally through Germany and giving concerts in all the important cities with his usual success. He appeared the same year in Dresden, and in Leipzig, Brunswick and Berlin the year following, where critics and musicians were unanimous in their praise of his performances. After this his last concert tour, he settled in Vienna in 1805, and devoted himself to teaching and composition. Among his published works we find a method for the guitar entitled: New theoretical and practical guitar school, Op. 21, and a method for the mandolin entitled School for the mandolin, violin system. The guitar method was published in French and German by Haslinger, Vienna; it was a standard work in Austria during the first part of the nineteenth century, and met with such success that it passed through eight editions up to the year 1833. The first eleven chapters, of his method are devoted to the theoretical part, and the twelfth concerns the instrument. After these twelve introductory chapters, follow scales, cadenzas, and studies in all keys, arranged progressively, and thirty exercises on arpeggios, the work being concluded with a fantasia of three pages for guitar solo. The mandolin method, which was issued by Breitkopf & Hartel, of Leipzig, in 1805, also passed through many editions, including one revised by Engelbert Rontgen and published in German. The first lesson describes the mandolin and its various types (lute, Milanese, Cremona and Neapolitan mandolins, etc.)., and it is followed by various exercises for the management of the plectrum. It treats of arpeggios, harmonics, etc., and concludes with a theme and six variations for mandolin with guitar accompaniment. This method was seen as completely out-of-date by 1914. Bortolazzi was the composer of many simple, yet beautiful songs, which were very popular during his life, and among other of his published compositions we mention the following: \n* Op. 5, Six Italian songs with guitar \n* Op. 8, Variations for mandolin and guitar, published in 1804 by Breitkopf & Hartel, Leipzig, and also by Cappi, Vienna \n* Op. 9, Sonata for mandolin and piano, same publishers \n* Op. 10, Six themes with variations (in two volumes) for mandolin and guitar \n* Op. 11, Six Italian songs with guitar, Simrock, Bonn;  \n* Op. 13, Six variations for guitar with violin obbligato \n* Op. 19, Twelve variations concertante for guitar and piano, Haslinger, Vienna \n* Op. 20, Six French romances with guitar \n* Periodical Amusements for the Spanish Guitar volume 4. \n* Twelve airs for guitar solo \n* Rondo for guitar and piano in A, Concha, Berlin \n* Sonata for guitar and piano, Peters, Leipzig \n* Six variations for violin and guitar, Spehr, Brunswick \n* Six dances and twelve books of guitar solos, Haslinger, Vienna \n* Six Venetian songs with guitar, published in 1802 by Chappell, London \n* Today, a trio for three voices with piano, dedicated to Count Waldestein, and printed for the author in 1801, London \n* Cantate a Voccasion de la reception d'un frere, London, 1801 \n* Maurer lied, London 1802, and numerous other similar works published in London and on the continent. He also left twelve variations for guitar remain in manuscript in Dresden and several others in Vienna."

He was a son of Maharana Ari Singh II and younger brother of Maharana Hamir Singh II. At ten years of age, Bhim Singh succeeded his brother, Hamir Singh II, who had died at 16 years of age from a wound when a rifle burst in his hand. Hamir Singh II had ruled an unstable state with an empty treasury under a regency by Maharaj Baghsingh and Arjunsingh. Bhim Singh inherited this unstable state, after its unpaid Maratha soldiers had looted Chittor. The soldiers' depradations continued and more territory was lost during Bhim Singh's rule. Bhim Singh was a weak ruler in a succession of ineffectual leaders. Mewar had once been considered the strongest Rajput state because of its lengthy resistance to the Mughal emperors, but by January 13, 1818, Bhim Singh had to sign a treaty with the British, accepting their protection."

Together with Arie Verkuijl and Pim de la Parra, Breeveld established the Film Institute Paramaribo (FIP). He is secretary of the foundation Surinamese Film Academy. In STVS, Breeveld is television program maker which include current affairs program Mmanten Taki. In December 2012, he figured like his brothers Carl, Hans and Clarence and his sister Lucia in the documentary Wan Famiri of the Dutch documentarian Geertjan Lassche. The family, however, has distanced itself from the end result. The focus would be on the December murders and Borger's friendly relations with main suspect Desi Bouterse, instead of the Breeveld family."

  "text" : "Benjamin Blake (born 22 February 1751, in Hackney, London; died in London 1827) was an English violinist, viola player and composer. Most of what is known about him comes from information he supplied for Sainsbury’s dictionary in 1824. As a boy he was taught the violin by Antonín Kammel, and later by Wilhelm Cramer, leader of the Italian Opera orchestra at the King’s Theatre. Blake himself played the violin in this orchestra from about 1775, and also at the Concert of Ancient Music. He came into public prominence however as a viola player. He was principal and soloist at the Professional Concert from 1785 to 1793, appearing regularly in string quartets with Cramer. He also played the viola at the Prince of Wales’s musical evenings, and his unusual interest in this instrument led to his publishing 18 duos for violin and viola in the 1780s. After the 1793 season Blake resigned from public performance. He was already studying the piano under Clementi to equip himself as a teacher, and though he continued to play the viola for the Prince of Wales he lived almost entirely by teaching until 1820 when he retired. Some of his duos merit revival, as also his sonatas for violin and piano, which were published in score and show an interesting taste for minor keys; the violin parts are called ‘accompaniments’ on the title page, but wrongly."

  "text" : "Ben Boloff (1893–1932) was a Soviet Russian communist who lived in Portland, Oregon. Described as an illiterate alien laborer who practiced Judaism, he was arrested in 1930 under Oregon's criminal syndicalism statute which barred a person from being in the Communist political party. Boloff was the first person to be tried under the state's criminal syndicalism law since its implementation after World War I. He was arrested with 12 other Communist party members who were all later acquitted or had the charges against them dropped. While in an Oregon penitentiary he contracted tuberculosis and was denied medical assistance. He was released from prison after fifteen months on a suspended sentence issued by the original circuit judge that sentenced him. He died on October 12, 1932 and his supporters called it a murder by the State of Oregon. His funeral attracted several socialist and communist supporters as they carried Boloff's coffin through the street. Despite being a citizen of Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, Boloff was never deported after being convicted and was eventually buried in his adopted hometown of Portland."

Ritchie is best recalled today for the silent comedy shorts he made between 1914 and 1920 for director/producer Henry Lehrman's L-KO Kompany and Fox Film Sunshine Comedy unit. Variations on Ritchie's \"tramp\" and \"drunk\" personae - which Ritchie had developed before and during his Karno years- were introduced to film audiences by Charlie Chaplin in such shorts as the Lehrman-directed Kid Auto Races at Venice (7 February 1914) and Mabel's Strange Predicament (9 February 1914).Ritchie, who - due to a series of on-set injuries, spent his final years relatively inactive- succumbed to stomach cancer in the summer of 1921.Winifred Monroe, the comedian's widow, and one-time stage partner, wound up in the employ of Charlie Chaplin. Wyn Ritchie, their daughter, was also a performer, and, in private life, the wife (of 55 years) of songwriter Ray Evans."

  "text" : "William Walter \"Bill\" Warner (February 11, 1969 – July 14, 2013) was an American motorcycle racer who set the land speed record on a conventional motorcycle in 2011. He died while racing his motorcycle in 2013. Warner was born in Little Falls, New York. He studied marine biology and chemistry at the University of Tampa. Warner was a tropical fish farmer in Wimauma, Florida. On July 17, 2011, riding a highly modified turbocharged Suzuki Hayabusa, Warner set a new world motorcycle land speed record of 311.945 miles per hour (502.027 km/h) from a standing start to 1.5 miles at the Loring Timing Association's Land Speed Race, held at the Loring Commerce Centre (the former Loring Air Force Base) in Limestone, Maine. Bill Warner began land speed racing his unfaired normally-aspirated Yamaha V-max in 2007, on which he entered the East Coast Timing Association (ECTA) 200 mph club that year. He purchased an unfaired turbo Suzuki Hayabusa in 2008, and quickly set the fastest unfaired (\"naked\") motorcycle records in land speed racing, eventually reaching 255 mph in 2010 at the Texas Mile. Later in 2010, Warner built, with the consultation of accomplished Bonneville motorcycle racer Larry Forstall, a set of Modified-class fiberglass bodywork for his Hayabusa. With this bodywork, sponsor and managerial support from Walt Kudron, he set the track record on the standing mile at the ECTA sanction in Maxton, NC, going 272 mph. He also holds track records at the Texas Mile at Goliad (278 mph), Loring (311 mph) and Mojave (274.8 mph) land speed sanctions. After going 278 mph in a mile on a Modified-class land speed motorcycle, Warner began building a new, Altered-class chassis, engine, and bodywork in order to attempt to break the 300 mph barrier on a conventional (rider-exposed) motorcycle. This undertaking was supported by many industry and personal sponsors, and absorbed all of Warner's time and energy. After breaking 300 on his first attempt in 2011 (with 11 mph to spare) on a 1,5 mile track, Warner sought to break 300 mph in a single mile, after which he planned to retire from ultimate land speed racing, auction his racing motorcycle, and manage his own standing-mile land speed event in Houston, Texas. On July 14, 2013, while attempting to break 300 mph in a single mile at the Loring Timing Association land speed meet, Warner lost control of his motorcycle at 285 miles per hour (459 km/h). His motorcycle veered off the course and struck a 6\" concrete landing light pedestal and he was thrown a great distance. Warner was conscious after the crash, but was pronounced dead at Cary Medical Center in Caribou, Maine. He had achieved 296 mph in a mile at the event, in less than optimal conditions. The cause of the accident is unclear, though investigators suspect mechanical or tire failure. He was survived by his parents, brother, and sister."

In 2000, she moved to Toronto from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. She is the stepmother of Angel, whose biological mother was Brenda Wolfe, one of Robert Pickton's murder victims. In 2009, Perrier accompanied Angel at Toronto's Native Women's Resource Centre for the Sisters in Spirit vigil in remembrance of Wolfe and the other more than 500 Canadian Aboriginal women who have been murdered or gone missing over the past 30 years. In 2010, Perrier picketed a courthouse in downtown Toronto in recognition of International Day of No Prostitution. She was joined by Trisha Baptie, Natasha Falle, Katarina MacLeod, and Christine Barkhouse, all former human trafficking victims and sex workers. In 2012, after being removed from a news conference relating to Bedford v. Canada, Perrier demonstrated a pimp stick to the media, saying that she had been battered with a pimp stick by her pimp every day that he prostituted her. Perrier opposed the legalization of brothels as proposed in Bedford v. Canada, saying, \"Having a legal bawdy house is not going to make it any safer. You are still going to attract serial killers, rapists, perverts.\" Bridget shared her story in the ground breaking article by Dr. Vincent J. Felitti in Cancer InCytes magazine (Volume 2, Issue 1) about how childhood trauma is associated with chronic diseases during adulthood, and how child trafficking will eventually worsen the economic burden on civil governance."

He is very well known in India and Pakistan for his tragic love story with Zainab, a Muslim girl he rescued during the communal riots in the time of partition of India in 1947. Both fell in love and got married. Later, being a Muslim, Zainab is deported and sent to the newly born Pakistan. Boota illegally enters Pakistan and when the girl backed off under the pressure from her family, he commits suicide by jumping before an upcoming train near Shahdara station in Pakistan along with his daughter but she survived. The love story of Singh's life is widely adapted in films and books on both sides of the border. A Punjabi film Shaheed-e-Mohabbat Boota Singh (1999) is entirely based on the story. Ishrat Rahmani wrote a novel, Muhabbat, based on the story. The story also influenced many other films including a 2007 Canadian film Partition and a 2001 Bollywood film Gadar."

His family may have been belt-makers in Lyon. He was commissioned to provide decorations for Ippolito II d'Este in 1540, Henry II of France in 1548, and Jacques Dalbon, Seigneur de Saint Andre in 1550. He worked closely with the printer Jean de Tournes to design, engrave, and illustrate many types of books such as emblem books, documentaries and scientific works, and literary works, including the Bible and Ovid's Metamorphoses (Lyon, Tournes, 1557). Salomon's figures were inspired by the elegant Mannerist art of the School of Fontainebleau, and were inspiration for engravers working in Lyon and became widely distributed and copied. He had a daughter who married the printer Robert Granjon. He is sometimes referred to as \"'Petit\", alluding to the intricate detail Salomon works into his designs at small scale."

  "text" : "Benjamin Conrad \"Cockie\" Robbins (1857 – 20 January 1953) was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council from 9 March 1936 to 8 March 1943; and 9 March 1943 to 8 March 1950. Robbins was born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, son of Capt. B. Robbins, and educated at the Yarmouth Academy. He arrived in Wellington in 1874, and was a storekeeper in Hawera from 1881. In Hawera he organised a local dairy factory and the National Dairy Association. He was on various local boards; Fire Board (3 years), Hospital Board (chairman 1906-09), and the Wanganui Education Board 1897-1906. His first public service was as a member of the school committee in Hawera for a good decade, where he was chairman for most of that time. He was a member of the Hawera Borough Council for fifteen years and Mayor of Hawera for seven years. Robbins stood in the 1893 election in the Egmont electorate and came second of three candidates. He contested the Hawera electorate in the 1896 and 1905 elections. He came a close second in 1896, and came third in 1905. Robbins moved to Tauranga in 1911, and was Mayor of Tauranga twice, from 1912 to 1915 and 1929 to 1933. He retired from the mayoralty in 1915 and did not contest the election, which was won by Charles MacMillan over John Cuthbert Adams. Robbins stood against the incumbent, William Herries of the Reform Party, in the 1919 election in the Tauranga electorate and was beaten with a margin of over 30% of the vote. He initially declared himself an Independent Progressive Liberal but received the endorsement of Joseph Ward and was the official candidate of the Liberal Party. He was appointed to the Legislative Council by the First Labour Government. He died in January 1953 aged 96 and is buried at the Presbyterian Cemetery on 18th Avenue in Tauranga. He married in 1877 Jane Anne Ross (died 6 March 1950)."

The upstart magazine's first headquarters were Cordner's garage in San Bruno, California. The magazine covers the sport of Track and Field and other aspects of the umbrella of Athletics. The monthly magazine has declared itself to be \"The Bible of the Sport.\" Bert had run the 880 yard dash in high school and continued to the cross country team at Berkeley. Returning from the Navy after World War II he first got his feet wet starting a small newspaper before the brothers began the magazine. Bert became one of the top writers of the sport. Starting in 1960 he established TAFNEWS Press, which went on to become the nation's leading track and field publisher. The company has over 100 titles. The first of those was the Little Red Book. Within the sport, the book was as important as Chairman Mao's book, but this book provided conversions between the metric system that are used in the sport worldwide and the Imperial units that are still common in America. The next book was the Little Gold Book which converted decathlon scores. Nelson was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1991."

  "text" : "Brownlow North (6 January 1810 – 9 November 1875) was an English evangelist. North was born in Winchester House, Chelsea. He was the grandson of Brownlow North, Bishop of Winchester. When he was born, he was in line to receive the earldom of Guilford, since the current earl, Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford, had no son, and neither did Brownlow's uncle, Francis North. However, due to Brownlow's \"youthful extravagances\", Francis remarried on the death of his wife, and did have a son, thus denying Brownlow the earldom. North was educated at Eton College. He lived for a while with his great uncle Frederick on Corfu, and fought with Dom Pedro's army in Portugal, before eventually settling in Scotland. North lived a life of pleasure, being fond of hunting and gambling, broken only by a period at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, when he considered taking holy orders. North experienced a religious conversion in November 1854, and began to attend Elgin Free Church. He proceeded to engage in public preaching. In 1859, he was appointed as an evangelist by the Free Church of Scotland. Moody-Stuart suggests that he gained in this an \"express recognition\" for lay-effort \"such as it had not obtained since the period immediately succeeding the Reformation.\" North was a significant figure in the 1859 revival in Ireland. On one occasion he preached to 12,000 people at Newtonlimavady.

He is the author of Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City, an ethnographic account of activities of the London Consolidation Crew (LCC), a group of urban explorers Garrett calls \"place hackers\". In a 2013 interview with Will Storr for the Daily Telegraph, Garrett described \"place hacking\" as \"...seeing the city like it’s a puzzle and putting the pieces of that puzzle together, connecting things\". Garrett went on to explain that \"...the more we feel like there are things we can’t do and places we can’t see, the more urban exploration has [a] capacity to give people hope\". Though Garrett has published academic research papers on archaeology, history and visual methods, it is his multimedia work (photos, videos and text) connected to the \"place hackers\" project which has received the most attention, both in academia and from the wider public. In October 2013, Prestel Publishing released a photo book called Subterranean London: Cracking the Capital that Garrett compiled with the LCC. The foreword to the book was written by Will Self, who met Garrett in 2013 when they debated Garrett's work Barbican Centre. In May 2016, Prestel Publishing is releasing another photo book edited by Garrett called \"London Rising: Illicit Photos from the City's Heights\""

  "text" : "Gaspard Joseph Benedict Balansa, also known as Benjamin Balansa or Benedict Balansa (25 March 1825 – 2 November 1891) was a French botanist. Born in Narbonne in 1825, Balansa made numerous collecting trips for the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris which holds most of his plant specimens. Others are in Muséum de Toulouse. His first journey, from 1847 to 1848, was to Algiers and Mostaganem in Algeria. From 1850 to 1853, Balansa returned to Algeria, collecting plants again in Mostaganem and later in Oran, Muaskar, the Northern Sahara, Biskra and Batna. From 1854 to 1855 he undertook his first trip to Asia travelling first to Smyrna and the surrounding regions in April and May, 1854. From March until October 1855 he lived in Mersin and the Taurus Mountains of Cilicia. The following year, he travelled from June until September 1856 from Tarsus to Kayseri in Cappadocia. In 1857 he settled with his family in Smyrna. From May until July 1857 he explored Uşak and the surrounding area and until 1865 he undertook tours to Phrygia and Cilicia. In 1866, he made a trip to Lazistan and the Caucasus, where he collected from June to August in the area of Trabzon and Rize. In autumn 1866 he returned to France. A year later, in 1867 he collected in Morocco in the area of Mogador, the Atlas Mountains and Marrakech. From 1868 to 1872 Balansa stayed overseas in New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands. During this time he was Director of the Jardin d'Acclimatation in Nouméa. From 1873 to 1877, he made his first trip to Paraguay, followed by a second from 1878 to 1884. In the years from 1885 to 1889, he collected in Tonkin and undertook a trip to the island of Java. In his (1890) second stay at Balansa died in Hanoi.

  "text" : "Baskaran Adhiban (born 15 August 1992 in Mayiladuthurai) is an Indian chess Grandmaster. He was the 2008 World Under-16 Champion and the 2009 Indian champion. In 2007 he won the Asian under-16 championship in Tashkent. Adhiban played on the first board for the gold medal-winning Indian team at the Under-16 Chess Olympiad of 2008. In 2011, he won the Cultural Village tournament in Wijk aan Zee and thanks to this victory he qualified for the 2012 Tata Steel C tournament. In this latter event, he tied for 3rd–4th with Daan Brandenburg with a score of 8.5/13. In the Chess World Cup 2013, Adhiban caused an upset in the first two rounds, beating 2710-rated Russian GM Evgeny Alekseev in the first round, and Alexandr Fier in the second one. Adhiban won the 2013 Sants Open in Barcelona with a score of 8.5 points out of 10. This event included 23 GMs and 28 IMs. In July 2014 he won the Masters open tournament of the Biel Chess Festival. In the following month, he contributed to India's bronze medal at the 41st Chess Olympiad in Tromsø scoring 7/11 on board four. He was also a member of the winning team of the Spanish League 2015, Solvay, along with teammates Pentala Harikrishna, Surya Shekhar Ganguly, Aleksander Delchev, Sergio Cacho Reigadas, Jesus Maria De La Villa Garcia, and Elizbar Ubilava. Adhiban competed in the Chess World Cup 2015, where he was knocked out by Vladimir Fedoseev in the first round, after the rapid tiebreaks. In January of 2016, Adhiban won the 2016 Tata Steel Challengers Tournament in a 3-way tie, which qualified him to play in the 2017 Tata Steel Masters Tournament. The co-leaders included GM Alexei Dreev and GM Eltaj Safarli, all of whom earned 9 points out of 13 (+6-1=6). However, because Adhiban defeated them both, Adhiban had the better tiebreaks and, therefore, guaranteed the spot in the next Tata Steel Masters tournament. Adhiban achieved a career high live rating of 2693 in September 2016."

Singh was born in 1884, a year before the accession of his father Fateh Singh to the throne of Mewar and Udaipur as Maharana. On 28 July 1921, following some social unrest in Mewar, his father was formally deposed, while being allowed to retain his titular title, and effective power in the state fell into the hands of Bhupal as his son and heir. He became ruler of the state in name as well as in fact in 1930. After the independence and partition of British India in 1947, Singh was one of the first of the Indian princes to sign an Instrument of Accession to the new Dominion of India, and on 18 April 1948 he became Rajpramukh of Rajasthan, succeeding Sir Bhim Singh, Maharaja of Kotah. With effect from 1 April 1949 his title was raised to Maha Rajpramukh. Also he was held titles of Honorary Major-General, Indian Army 15 October 1946 (earlier Honorary Lt.-Col. 4 August 1939), Honorary Colonel, Indian Grenadiers, 1 June 1954. In the 26th amendment to the Constitution of India promulgated in 1971, the Government of India abolished all official symbols of princely India, including titles, privileges, and remuneration (privy purses). Bhagwat Singh succeeded him as the titular ruler of the state. One of Bhopal Singh's palaces was Jag Niwas, on an island in Lake Pichola, since used for the filming of several films, including the James Bond film Octopussy (1983)."

  "text" : "Bobby Eugene Wright (March 1, 1934, Hobson City, Alabama - April 6, 1982, Chicago) was an American clinical psychologist, scholar, educator, political activist and humanitarian. He received his BSc in Education and MSc in Counseling from Chicago State University and his PhD in Clinical Psychology from the University of Chicago in 1972. At the point of his untimely death he was President-Elect of the Association of Black Psychologists. During the mid 1960s he worked as a truant officer in the Chicago Public School system, and led a successful challenge to racist hiring procedures for black teachers. His political work has been credited with helping lay foundations that later enabled the election of Chicago's first African-American mayor, Harold Washington in 1983. Two of his scholarly works have been described as highly influential by the 2013 National Conference on African/Black Psychology: The Psychopathic Racial Personality (1974, republished in 1984 and other years as one in a series of essays), and Mentacide: The Ultimate Threat to Black Survival (1979). He has been classed in the 'radical school' of Black psychology of the time - those who developed a self-consciously independent framework in opposition to the dominant worldview stemming from europeans, many of whom were influenced by Frantz Fanon; by contrast with traditionalists who worked with the American Psychological Society of the time and critiqued but did not correct, or reformists who were partially independent and appealed for change to both white and black cultures. He also wrote The Black Child: A Destiny in Jeopardy. He contributed to political processes concerning the continent of Africa and Pan-Africanism. The Bobby E. Wright Comprehensive Mental Health Centre in Chicago was so renamed in his honor. Overall his work emphasized the need to recognize psychological racial warfare, and for Africans to define themselves in their terms, while analyzing the psychology of White supremacy not only of its victims, and to develop a durable social theory and associated institutions to change the politics of mental health."

The theatrical release of Mona is considered one of the watershed events that helped inaugurate the Golden Age of erotic art films in the United States. The film is one of the paradigms for theatrically released erotic art films. In 1970, Osco directed the documentary Hollywood Blue with Michael Benveniste (as Mike Lite) and Howard Ziehm and, in the same year, the film Mona. Later, in 1971, Osco produced another erotic art film, Harlot. In 1974, he produced a sci-fi spoof of Flash Gordon, Flesh Gordon. In 1976, Osco produced the musical comedy Alice in Wonderland: An X-Rated Musical Comedy, which, in a softcore version, received an R-rating from the MPAA. The film was released in mainstream theaters and grossed over $90 million globally. Starting in 1987, Osco directed an additional six movies and shorts, only two of which had erotic themes. In 2007, an Off-Broadway musical based on his Alice in Wonderland was staged at the Kirk Theatre in New York City. Osco was credited with writing the book. The show was entitled Alice in Wonderland: An Adult Musical Comedy and flyers advertising it were designated \"For Mature Audiences Only\". The show was set in a trailer park in Weehawken, New Jersey."

Bill Ray was born in Anaconda, Montana on April 6, 1922 to Eli and Marchetta Ray, who were of Serbian and Yugoslavian descent. Ray and his family lived in Montana, Idaho, and Oregon. After graduating from Wallace High School in Wallace, Idaho, Ray moved to Juneau, Alaska in 1938 with his family. He served in the United States Navy during World War II. Returning to Juneau following the war, Ray worked as a bartender at the PaMaRay Club, a bar established by his parents along the busy \"bar block\" on Juneau's South Franklin Street. Eli and Marchetta had become known in the years following their arrival in Juneau as Pa and Ma Ray, hence the name. Ray also worked as a card dealer, a longshoreman and in commercial fishing. He would later go into business for himself in Juneau, owning and operating a bar, a liquor store, and a charter boat business. Ray served as a Democrat in the Alaska House of Representatives in 1964 and then in the Alaska State Senate in 1970. In 2001, Ray moved to Sequim, Washington where he lived in retirement. In 2002, Ray wrote his memoir: Liquor, Legislation & Laughter: the story of a S.O.B. (Sweet Old Bill). He also wrote: The Hacker's Bible, about golf. Ray died of a heart attack in Seattle, Washington."

Shiban participated in the Yemeni revolution, helping run a media centre in Sana'a's Change Square. In September 2013 Shiban was detained at Gatwick Airport under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, after his arrival in the United Kingdom to speak at an event at Chatham House. Shiban was questioned for an hour and a half about his political views and his work for Reprieve. When Shiban objected to officials that his views had no relation to security concerns, the officials threatened to detain him for the maximum nine hours permitted under the act. Shiban had previously visited the UK without incident during 2013."

  "text" : "Berek Lajcher (October 24, 1893 – August 2, 1943) was a Jewish physician and social activist from Wyszków before the Holocaust in Poland, remembered for his leadership in the prisoner uprising at Treblinka extermination camp. More than 800,000 Jews, as well as unknown numbers of Romani people, were murdered at Treblinka in the course of Operation Reinhard in World War II. Lajcher was a graduate of the Warsaw University Faculty of Medicine in 1924, and a retired officer of the Polish Army from the Polish–Soviet War of Independence. After the German invasion of Poland during World War II, Lajcher was expelled by the Nazis along with all Polish Jews from Wyszków, and relocated to Węgrów, from where he was deported to Treblinka, the secretive forest camp where Jewish men, women and children were being put to death in gas chambers. Lajcher became the leader and clandestine organizer of the Treblinka revolt. On August 2, 1943, after a long period of preparation, the prisoners stole some weapons from the arsenal and made an attempt at an armed escape from the Totenlager. Lajcher was killed in the fighting. Several Trawniki guards were killed and some 150 Jewish prisoners escaped. Gassing operations at the camp ended soon after the revolt. Lajcher was remembered by survivors incorrectly as either Dr. Lecher (sic), or Dr. Leichert from Wegrów."

  "text" : "Benedict of York (died 1189) was a moneylender and a leading member of the 12th century Jewish community in York, England. Benedict was considered the second greatest moneylender in York after Josce of York. Benedict acquired several lands as a result of his activities and debts to him were still being honoured a decade after his death. Benedict attended the coronation of King Richard I along with Josce of York, and was forcibly baptised as \"William\" during the subsequent attacks on the Jewry of London at Richard's coronation. Benedict was severely wounded in the attack and accepted a Christian baptism from a monk from York, Prior William of St. Mary's Abbey. Benedict recanted his Christian faith the next day when summoned before King Richard. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Baldwin of Forde, said of Benedict's recantation that \"...if he will not be a Christian, let him be the devil's man\". Benedict later appealed to King Richard to allow him to return to his Jewish faith, though this was against canon laws. He died in Northampton soon after his forced baptism. The chronicler Roger of Hoveden said that Benedict was buried in neither the Jewish or Christian cemetery in Northampton following his death as a result of his recantation. Benedict's house at Spen Lane was described by William of Newbury as like \"unto a royal palace in size and strength\". Benedict's children and his widow were burnt alive in his house during the Easter York riot in 1190."

  "text" : "Berowulf or Berowelf (died 26 September 800) was the bishop of Würzburg from 768 or 769 until his death. Since the 11th century, his name has appeared as Bernwelf. It may also be spelled Berowolf, Bernwulf or Bernulf. Berowulf's predecessor, Megingoz, retired in 768. The first reference to Berowulf as bishop comes from April 769. Prior to his election he was a monk from the local monastery of Sankt Andreas. As bishop, he introduced the rule of Chrodegang to replace that of Boniface. He had a close relationship with Charlemagne (reigned 768–814), who charged him with the evangelisation of the Slavs in the upper Main region. In 779 he was commissioned to establish a new missionary diocese, the bishopric of Paderborn, in the east. The first two bishops of that see, Hathumar and Badurad, were sent to Würzburg Cathedral to be educated at the school Berowulf had established. He also grew the scriptorium, and the first catalogue of books in the cathedral library dates from his episcopate. The main part of the list was written in an Anglo-Saxon hand around 800. A later addition, in a German hand, notes five books which had been lent to Holzkirchen and Fulda Abbey. In all, it contains thirty-five books. It was compiled after 787—since the manuscript fly-leaf contains a copy in the same hand of Charlemagne's letter De litteris colendis of that year—but probably before 800. In October 788, Berowulf brought the relics of Saint Kilian to the cathedral which now bears the saint's name. In 787, he tried unsuccessfully to assert episcopal control over Fulda. His successor in Würzburg was the obscure Liuttrit (800–803)."

A Pioneer Arizonan, her family first settled in the Territory in 1870. Barton was born near the historic family homestead in Artesia, Arizona. After over twenty years service in accounting and materials management with the City of Safford, she retired in 2009. She participated in the Sagebrush rebellion, and Barton is a former county officer with People for the West, an advocacy group promoting private property rights and opposing federal intervention in western lands. She attended and graduated from The Leadership Institute as well as the Western Legislative Academy in Colorado. Barton is also a graduate of the Dodie Londen Excellence in Public Service Series and a former state officer with the Arizona Federation of Republican Women. Barton's district reaches from the Grand Canyon, through Flagstaff and Sedona and east through Payson to the White Mountains. The population of her Legislative District is over 216,000, and Flagstaff is the largest metropolitan area within her District. Frustrated by the economic impacts to her rural district caused by the United States federal government shutdown in 2013, as well as the administration's initial refusal to allow Arizona to keep the park open, Barton took to Facebook to express her anger over the losses of over $1.6 million per day being suffered by her rural communities and compared President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler."

  "text" : "Bernard d'Ascoli (born 1958) is a French pianist. Born in Provence, France, and blind since the age of 3, d'Ascoli began learning piano and organ at the age of eleven, using scores written in Braille. In 1974 he was the youngest French Baccalaureat graduate of the year and four years later at the age of nineteen, he won the First Prize in the Barcelona International Piano Competition. In 1980 he received honorable mention at the Fryderyk Chopin competition.After winning prizes in Santander, Leipzig and Warsaw, d'Ascoli came to major public attention in 1981 when, following his Third Prize in the Leeds International Piano Competition, he made his London debut in recital and with orchestra and made his first recording of the Liszt sonata and other works for EMI. He made his first appearance with a major American orchestra in 1992, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He went on to perform in London (Royal Festival Hall and the Barbican), Amsterdam (Concertgebouw), Vienna (Musikverein), Melbourne, Paris, Tokyo, Madrid, Washington, Geneva, and the Sydney Opera House. He has performed with most British orchestras, including the main London ones, as well as with many major overseas ensembles such as the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Montreal Symphony, Boston Symphony, and Dresden Philharmonic. The conductors he has appeared with include Svetlanov, Sanderling, Berglund, Plasson, Casadesus, Guschlbauer, Litton, Menuhin, Pritchard, Llewellyn, Herbig, Leppard, Fischer, Järvi, Parrot and Andrew Davis. He has taken part in international festivals such as the BBC Proms, Sintra, Oviedo, Besançon or La Roque d'Anthéron. In 2000 he was a special guest of the Sydney Olympic festivities, appearing at the Opera House both as recitalist and soloist with the Sydney Symphony. He is founder and Artistic Director of PIANO CANTABILE, an organisation based in Provence which is dedicated to the coaching and professional support of highly talented young pianists. d'Ascoli has recorded albums of Chopin and Schumann for Nimbus and has made regular recordings as well as live broadcasts for the BBC. He features prominently on a Schumann CD issued by Linn Records of the Quintet and other works, where he is joined by the Schidlof Quartet. His special affinity with Chopin's music led him to undertake the complete recording of the Scherzi, Impromptus and Nocturnes for the Athene-Minerva label. This double album was selected as \"Editor's Choice\" in Gramophone magazine."

  "text" : "Bill Birrell is a British artist. He was born in Glasgow, United Kingdom, in 1945. He studied at Glasgow School of Art from 1964–66 and from 1968–70. He has lived and worked in Toronto, Canada and in Glasgow, U.K. While he was a student at Glasgow he started to develop his unique style. His older brother Ronald Birrell, who was also an artist, was a major influence on his life during this time. His first paintings were industrial landscapes and figure compositions. Birrell's work is difficult to categorize, not simply realistic, figurative, symbolist, surrealist, historical or combinations of these. It often contains figures in rooms or landscapes, usually female, creating a potent atmosphere of disquiet or sometimes harmony. It is the creation of this atmosphere that is important to him. While he was a student at the GSA he began to show paintings at the Royal Glasgow Institute. In 1970 he met Cyril Gerber, a Glasgow art dealer. Birrell would later exhibit his drawings, paintings, and constructions at Cyril Gerber's Compass Gallery in Glasgow. He has also shown his work at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh, at Le Mur Vivant gallery, and the Lamont Gallery in London, and at Corporart. He has also exhibited his work in Toronto, Bath, Geneva, and Copenhagen. James Morrison, with Scottish Television created a 1989 film about his work which stressed his uniqueness and separation from the Scottish art establishment. Birrell works mostly in oil paint and ink, and often works out his ideas on paper before transferring them to canvas or board. His main influences were his brother Ronald Birrell and early Renaissance painters such as Piero Della Francesca and Piero Di Cosimo."

  "text" : "Bernhard Stempfle (1882 in Munich – 30 June 1934) was a Catholic priest and journalist. He helped Adolf Hitler in the writing of Mein Kampf. He was murdered in the Night of the Long Knives. Stempfle entered the priesthood in 1904. He joined the Hieronymite order (the Poor Hermits of Saint Jerome) in Italy. In the years leading up to the First World War, he wrote for the Corriere della Sera and various other German and Italian papers. Following the outbreak of war, he returned to Munich, performed pastoral work at the university, and established close contacts with Reform Catholic elements (i.e., elements that opposed political Catholicism, and politicians it regarded as too willing to make compromises with the Jews and \"atheistic\" socialists) in the city, especially the nationalistic Hofklerus at St. Kajetan. In 1919, he first began publishing in the Munchener Beobachter, where he wrote relentlessly on the destructive influence of Jewish atheism and on the moral acceptability and necessity of ruthless persecution of Jews, even as far as pogroms, pursued in defense of the faith and institutions of the Catholic Church, and the example provided throughout the years by anti-Semitic leaders within the hierarchy. By 1920, he was a leader of the secretive anti-republican Organisation Kanzler (Orka) and by 1923 he was chief editor of the anti-Semitic daily Miesbacher Anzeiger and a leading journalistic figure within the broader volkish-anti-Semitic movement in Catholic Bavaria. He was also a regular confidant of Hitler. As an increasingly prominent Nazi figure, he was the target of Social Democratic satire and portrayed as the anti-Semitic bishop of Miesbach. He idealized Hitler and attacked the BVP, Center party, and their alleged Jewish backers. According to Hitler's personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, Stempfle frequently visited Munich and was a member of Hitler's inner circle, joining Hitler \"at his corner table at the Café Heck\", and advising him on religious issues. In June 1934, having been deported to the Dachau concentration camp, his body was found in the woods near Harlaching. His death is attributed by some accounts to a broken neck and by others to shots in the heart \"while trying to escape\". There is disagreement also over the reasons for his murder. In some accounts, it is considered possible that he was regarded as having too much information about Hitler's past and personal life, and especially about the death of Hitler's niece, Geli Raubal. Other accounts hold that it was perhaps his attacks on Christian Weber, for immorality and running a brothel, that determined his fate."

  "text" : "Basil Nikitin (1885 - 7 June 1960) was a Russian orientalist and diplomat. Basil Nikitin was born in Sostonovit, a town in Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. Nikitin's family had several Orientalists. Therefore, he developed an interest in the subject as a boy. He took trips to the Black Sea region and the Caucasus. After graduation from high school in 1904, Nikitin traveled to Russia, where he enrolled at the Lazarev Institute to learn Persian and Turkish. In 1908, Nikitin applied for a job at the Foreign Ministry in Saint Petersburg. He was hired, and his first posting was to the Russian Embassy in Afghanistan. He served at the embassy for a year, returning to Paris and marrying. In 1911, Nikitin once again found himself in a Russian Embassy. This time it was as Vice-Consul in Rasht, Gilan. Here he studied the agrarian question noting that landlords collected both state taxes and exacted a rent whose magnitude varied according to their greed. This situation had given rise to many peasants abandoning their villages. In 1915, he was promoted to consul and based in Urmia. It was here that he arranged a meeting with Shimun XXI Benyamin, the Assyrian Patriarch who had agreed for Assyrian troops to join the Imperial Russian Army. Nikitin promised that after the First World War the Assyrians would be offered national community land in Russia. However, the matter was not pursued as the 1917 Revolution prevented further meaningful discussions. He served as ambassador for three years. During this term, Nikitin saw the outbreak of the First World War and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. When the October Revolution broke out and Zarens was ousted, Nikitin decided against returning to Russia, and emigrated instead to France. After settling in France, he retired from politics and began writing books. He published several books, writing mostly about the Kurds and other people of the Middle East. The time spend in the Middle East had endowed Nikitin with a deep insight into the Kurdish problem. He was, therefore, in a unique position to identify and understand the awakening of Kurdish nationalism. He closely studied the development of the Kurdish nationalism, classifying it in three phases. The first phase, which was marked by rioting, he referred to as the unorganized and directionless phase. The second phase, according to Nikitin, was the one that showed the first signs of organization. This phase was between 1880 and 1918. It was also the period during which the first Kurdish political parties and associations came into being. The third phase was the phase when the Kurds appeared as a political force on the international political scene, as demonstrated by historic agreements like the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920."

After the death of his father at Merv in 651, Bahram fled to China along with many other Sasanian nobles, where he and his brother Peroz III asked the Chinese Emperor Gaozong to support them in their fight against the Arabs. Bahram repeatedly tried to recapture the occupied Iranian territories from the Arabs, which he did not succeed in. Bahram died in 710, his son, Prince Khosrau (Chinese: Juluo), continued his father's military efforts. However, Khosrau's campaigns and his first successful invasion into Persia were eventually unsuccessful."

His father Longolongoʻatumai Aleamotuʻa bore the title of \"Lord Fielakepa\" before him; Sosaia Aleamotuʻa, as the eldest son and second of six children, inherited it upon his father's death in 1997. Though he had an elder sister, the kingdom's thirty-three titles of hereditary nobility may only be held by men. He also inherited the estates attached to the title, and the traditional responsibilities thereupon. In 1984, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Auckland in New Zealand, followed by a Master of Laws degree from the International Maritime Law Institute in Malta in 1996. He entered public service in 1986 as Assistant Secretary in the Tongan Ministry of Justice. He was later appointed Private Secretary to King Taufaʻahau Tupou IV, and clerk to the Privy Council of Tonga. In 1998, he was appointed Governor of the Haʻapai district, a position which entitled him ex officio to a seat in the Legislative Assembly, in Cabinet and in the Privy Council. In 2001, he was appointed Minister for Lands, Survey and Natural Resources, under Prime Minister Prince Tukuʻaho. As minister, he introduced a number of \"procedural simplifications\" to the policies of his department. From 2008 to 2011, he served as Chairman of the Royal Land Commission. In 2007, King George Tupou V appointed him Lord Chamberlain - a position which was created for him. Two years later, he was one of the first to be appointed to the equally new position of Law Lord within the Privy Council. He was also one of the only three nobles in Tongan history (at the time) to be elevated to the title of baron (the first having been Baron Vaea in 1970). Having \"suffered from diabetes and heart problems\" he died at Auckland City Hospital in New Zealand on 10 February 2013, at the age of fifty-one."

Patchett took part in propaganda broadcasts following his defection, in which he condemned British espionage."

When in Italy, his subjects were based on gods of legend and romantic motifs. Toermer often painted in the style of the old Dutch. In 1852 Toemer was invited to exhibit a work entitled “The Wedding Morning – Ill Omen” at the Royal Academy in London.

  "text" : "The Barjeel Art Foundation is a museum and cultural institution located in the United Arab Emirates with a mandate to manage, preserve and exhibit the personal art collection of Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi. The Foundation serves as a resource for Arab modern and contemporary art and hosts exhibitions and lends artwork to international institutions such as Serralves Foundation (Portugal) and the Mori Art Museum (Tokyo), while also serving as an educational vehicle for local and international art communities. The foundation has shown works that highlight the value of heritage, family, structure and history and how it is translated in the context of globalisation. Other works examine life in the Diaspora, the desire to create an identity or recapture a history that has become lost or scattered. Barjeel Art Foundation initiates, supports and presents artistic projects all over the world. Through curated exhibitions of the collection, loans to leading institutions and international forums such as Asilah Festival (Morocco), and Art Dubai (UAE) as well as various efforts to support educational activities by contributing to the image archives of Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World (MEMAAW), organizing panel discussions and student tours, the foundation aims to create a public platform for critical debate around the contemporary art practice of artists with Arab heritage. Consisting of over 1000 pieces of modern and contemporary art from Arab artists, the foundation is the most comprehensive publicly accessible art collection in the Middle East. It operates from a permanent base in the Maraya Art Centre in Al Qasba, Sharjah. The Al Qasba complex was designed and executed by the Halcrow Group, which was acquired by CH2M Hill in 2011. Al Qasba opened to the public in 2005."
