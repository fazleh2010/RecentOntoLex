Boettcher's hunting lodge, the Boettcher House (also sometimes referred to as Lorraine Lodge, (National Register of HIstoric Places listed building #84000858, Charles Boettcher Summer Home and the Jefferson County Conference & Nature Center). ) was built in 1917 as a summer home and seasonal hunting lodge. It sits on 110-acres donated to Jefferson County, Colorado, in the 1970s and has been used for weddings and other public events since 1975. It was designed by Denver architect John J. Huddart. The foundation bearing his family name has supported numerous projects in Colorado such as the Boettcher Concert Hall and the Denver Botanic Gardens."

His winning stride continued, he again won with a thumping majority. the voters of his constituency blessed him for his untiring efforts to develop the constituency. he was largely tipped to make it into B. S. Yediyurappa's constituency, but the party wanted him to be in the organisation and strengthen the party. When D. V.

Two of his most famous horses were the American bred Walter Dear and French Gelinotte. Charlie Mills was born as one of the six sons of an Irish horse trainer Anthony Mills. His father came to Germany for working as a trainer at the newly opened Bahrenfeld race track in Hamburg. Charlie soon started to drive himself and won his first race in 1903 at Berlin. In 1931 he started a stud farm named Gestüt Lindenhof in Templin, Brandenburg with a Jewish publisher and horse breeder Bruno Cassirer, who later emigrated to Britain. In 1935 Mills acquired another stud farm in Kremmen. After the war Mills moved to France in 1947 and had a farm at Senlis, north of Paris. Charlie Mills spent his last years in Switzerland where he died at the age of 83. In 1966 Mills made a short appearance in a French comedy Le Caïd de Champignol by Jean Bastia. The film was shot in Senlis."

  "text" : "Charles Alexander Weibel (born October 28, 1950 in Terre Haute, Indiana) is an American mathematician working on algebraic K-theory, algebraic geometry and homological algebra. Weibel studied physics and mathematics at the University of Michigan, earning bachelor's degrees in both subjects in 1972. He was awarded a master's degree by the University of Chicago in 1973 and achieved his doctorate in 1977 under the supervision of Richard Swan (Homotopy in Algebraic K-Theory). From 1970 to 1976 he was an \"Operations Research Analyst\" at Standard Oil in Indiana, and spent 1977–78 at the Institute for Advanced Study. In 1978 he became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania and in 1980 an assistant professor at Rutgers University, where he was promoted to professor in 1989. He joined Vladimir Voevodsky and Markus Rost in proving the (motivic) Bloch–Kato conjecture (2009). It is a generalization of the Milnor conjecture of algebraic K-theory, which was proved by Voevodsky in the 1990s. He was a visiting professor in 1992 in Paris and 1993 in Strasbourg. Since 1983 he has been an editor of the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra. In 2014, he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society."

  "text" : "Christen Jensen Lodberg (31 October 1625 - 12 June 1693) was a Danish bishop. Born in Todbøl, Lodbjerg Parish, his father, Jens Christensen, was a farmer. In his eleventh year he went to the small grammar school in Thisted, and then to Viborg, from Viborg perhaps to Odense and finally to Roskilde school, from which he graduated in 1647. During his studies, he returned to the farm to help out. After completing his theological studies and accumulating some money, he traveled abroad in 1652, partly helped by a scholarship. Beset by lack of funds, he may have enlisted as a soldier on his travels, first in Naples, where he is said to have become acquainted with a Spanish general, under whom he served one and a half years in the Spanish guard. After his return in 1657, he took a master's degree, gave philosophical lectures and released some physico-astronomical theses, one of which, Philosophical-theological study on the first 2 verses of Genesis, attracted attention. After again having been abroad, as the steward of a young nobleman, he became in 1663 professor at Sorø Academy, which had been in decline. In 1665 he was called to court as tutor to the King of Denmark's younger son, Prince George of Denmark. He was appointed dean of Roskilde in 1666, while continuing to be the prince's confessor. In 1681, he became bishop of Ribe and the following year a doctor of theology. In 1671, he married Johanne Eilertz #1649-1714#, daughter of Alderman Jacob Eilertz of Copenhagen. He died in Ribe, and was buried in Roskilde Cathedral. His son Jacob Lodberg was bishop of Odense. Based on text from the Dansk biografisk leksikon."

  "text" : "Catualda (flourished in 1st century AD) was a Marcomannic exile who deposed the Marcomannic king Maroboduus in 18 AD. Catualda is mentioned in The Annals of the Roman historian Tacitus. Following the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, while Germanicus was avenging Rome beyond the Rhine, Drusus attempted to divide and conquer the tribes within the vast realm of the Marcomannic ruler Maroboduus. Drusus established relations with Catualda, a young Marcomannic noble living in exile among the Gutones. After the weakening of Maroboduus following the previous invasion of Bohemia by Arminius, Catualda returned with a \"strong force\" in 18 AD, and having \"corruptly won over the nobles\", entered the palace and deposed Maroboduus. In an adjacant fortress, Catualda \"found the long-accumulated plunder of the Suevi and camp followers and traders from our provinces who had been attracted to an enemy's land, each from their various homes, first by the freedom of commerce, next by the desire of amassing wealth, finally by forgetfulness of their fatherland.\" Catualda was however soon defeated by the \"overwhelming strength\" of Vibilius of the Hermunduri, and was like Maroboduus forced to seek refuge in the Roman Empire. He was thus settled in Forum Julii (Fréjus) in Gallia Narbonensis. The Marcomanni were subsequently ruled by the Quadian client king Vannius, who was himself also deposed by Vibilius in coordination with own nephews."

  "text" : "Charles Russell \"Charlie\" Dunn (c. 1898 – September 23, 1993) was an American bootmaker of handmade Western, or cowboy, boots for more than 80 years. Dubbed the \"Michelangelo of cowboy boots,\" he first gained widespread notice in the wake of Jerry Jeff Walker's song \"Charlie Dunn\" (1972). By the time he retired in 1988 from Texas Traditions, his shop in Austin, he routinely charged up to $3,000 for a pair of boots, had a waiting list of hundreds of interested buyers willing to wait three years for delivery, and had made boots for a long list of celebrities, including Arnold Palmer, Mary Kay Place, Gene Autry, Slim Pickens, Don F Brooks, Harry Belafonte, Ernest Tubb, Peter Fonda, and Carole King. Don Counts, who owned several pairs of Charlie's boots and lured him out of a premature retirement, described Charlie as \"a real character, an elflike creature who captivated everybody.\" Known for his colorful language and broad sense of humor, Charlie in his customary black beret and cobbler's apron measured out at 5'4\" and 135 pounds of pure imp. One friend noted that even though he was \"quiet-spoken,\" he could \"tell stories all day and all night.\" When Charlie died at 95 from complications arising from a stroke, he had passed along his bootmaking mastery to Lee Miller, his heir-designate, thus assuring the survival of exceptional bootmaking in the traditional, handmade manner. As with four generations of Dunns before him, Charlie had persevered in and prolonged the production of custom boots, despite the general trend toward bootmaking in factories. One of a handful of survivors of an endangered species—the half artisan, half artist maker of once-common items—Charlie managed, in passing his skills to a new generation, to make sure that the world continued to enjoy prized bootmaking."

There was no Democratic candidate in the general election. Representative Bell serves on the Appropriations and Land & Resource Management Committees and the Subcommittee on Articles VI, VII & VIII. In January 2015, Bell introduced legislation, HB 623, that prevents salary, pension, and other benefits from being paid to any Texas state employee who issues a same-sex marriage license. The bill included a provision to forestall legal action challenging the proposed law by mandating that state courts dismiss any such challenges and award court costs and attorney's fees to the state. Rep. Bell is a strong advocate for traditional values, an advocate for state and citizen sovereignty and for a limited federal government. Bell also supports expanding career and technology training at public high schools so that interested, motivated students can enter the job market with a career certification, without following the college or university route."

  "text" : "Corinne Morgan (16 February 1876 – 1945?) was the stage name of Corinne (or Cora) Welsh. She was a contralto singer and pioneer recording artist who recorded popular songs in the early years of the twentieth century and was best known for her duets with Frank Stanley. Some sources misspell her name as Corrine. She was born at Commercial Point, Ohio, the daughter of John C. Welsh, a farmer, and later moved to New York City. In 1902, she started recording for the major cylinder recording companies of the day, including Edison and Columbia, although after 1904 most of her recordings were for Victor Records. She was one of the first female singers to record regularly, and mainly recorded sentimental rather than comic songs. Her successful duets with Frank Stanley included \"It's A Lovely Day For A Walk\" (1903), \"Listen To The Mocking Bird\" (1904), and \"When You and I Were Young, Maggie\" (1905). She also recorded with the Haydn Quartet on \"Toyland\" (from the operetta Babes In Toyland, 1904), \"Dearie\" (1905) and \"How'd You Like To Spoon With Me?\" (1906). Her solo recordings included \"So Long, Mary\" (1906), and \"Lullaby\" (1907). She does not seem to have recorded after 1909, but worked as a professional singer until at least 1919. Most sources give her year of death as 1945, although a date in 1942 has also been suggested."

  "text" : "Chung On Siew (simplified Chinese: 郑安寿, traditional Chinese: 鄭安壽, pinyin: Zhèng Ānshòu, 1851 - 25 December 1907) was a low profile mainland Chinese capitalist, industrialist, inventor, investor, philanthropist and real estate developer known for his extensive travels and scholarship. He was conferred upon the title Justice of the Peace by the Queen of England, Alexandrina Victoria, for his contributions in charity and education to the British Commonwealth during the late eighteenth-century. His anglicised and transliterated surname Chung, derived from the surname Zheng, is also anglicised and transliterated as Chang or Zhang. Based on historical records, he was the descendant, precisely the twenty fourth generation, of an aristocratic family from Xinyang, Henan Province, China. This scholar-gentry family dominated the Zhuangyuan title of the prestigious Chinese imperial examination for over a thousand years. Despite being subjugated during the Tang Dynasty, as descendants of royalty from the Zheng (state), they became the most powerful and richest people as well as top scholars recorded in ancient Chinese history. During the Qing Dynasty, as a result of their family ties with the ruling Aixinjueluo family through marriages as well as their ranks in imperial court, they were assigned to carry out imperial edict in Canton, modern day Guangzhou, China. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he was invited by the British to develop British Malaya. He was known as a wise investor as well as the inventor of the hydraulic mining method. One of his largest tin mines employed over 400 men. His tin mines were managed by European engineer, A. Hamilton.  He has a street named after him in the tin mining town of Ipoh, Perak. The street was selected by Oscar-winning Taiwanese Director Ang Lee as a setting for one of his award-winning movies. An international hotel chain, ibis Styles, was constructed along the street after demolishment of his pre war shophouses in 2013. According to a prolific British writer, Arnold Wright, he was one of the biggest owner with many rubber plantations and tin mines in South East Asia. Based on the Singapore Straits Times published on 4 June 1908, he acquired many other properties in China and Hong Kong. He retired back to China in 1905 and resided in China until his death in 1907. His descendants now reside in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, United Kingdom and United States of America while some remain in China."

  "text" : "Christian David Gebauer (15 October 1777 – 15 September 1831) was an animal painter and an etcher. Gebauer was born at Nowa Sól in Silesia, and educated at the Copenhagen Academy from 1800 under Lorentzen. He devoted himself to landscapes as well as animals, executing the latter at first in Indian ink, but afterwards in oil. In 1813 he proceeded to Dresden, where he took to drawing, painting, and etching military scenes, and in 1815 was received into the Academy there. Later in his life he established a school of design at Aarhus, where he died in 1831. His pictures of horses and dogs, several of which are in the Copenhagen Gallery, are among his best works."

  "text" : "Clifford Embleton (11 May 1931 – 4 July 1994) was a British geomorphologist. He was born in Bromborough at that time in Cheshire. He was the son of Arthur Thomas Embleton (1895-1954), a shipping clerk, and Constance Fitzgerald (1896-1948). He was educated at Birkenhead School and won an open exhibition at St John's College, Cambridge to read geography. He graduated in 1953 having won the Philip Lake Prize. His doctoral thesis in 1956 was on the glacial landforms of north Wales. His research on glaciation in Wales and Norway led to the publication of a classic text on the subject, 'Geomorphology, Glacial and Periglacial' with Cuchlaine King, published by Hodder & Stoughton in May 1968, ISBN 0713153776 which was later substantially revised in 1975. He became a lecturer and then senior lecturer at Birkbeck College, London and University College, London and became a professor at King's College, London in 1982. He published 75 academic papers and books on glaciation, geomorphology in Europe, geomorphological hazards and a geographical study of Africa. He was a gifted organist and was elected fellow of the Royal College of Organists when only 18 years old. He married Davina Caroline Cherry in 1956 and they had three sons. They divorced and he married Christine Hamann in 1991."

  "text" : "Carl \"Charlie\" Brandt (1957 – c. September 13, 2004) was an American murderer and serial killer. Brandt, a native of Indiana and longtime resident of the Florida Keys, committed suicide in September 2004 after his wife, Teresa \"Teri\" Brandt, was stabbed seven times and his niece, Michelle Jones, was decapitated and had suffered severe mutilation. An investigation by police concluded that Brandt had murdered Teri Brandt and Michelle Jones before hanging himself in Jones' garage. It later came to light that Brandt had shot his parents – his pregnant mother fatally – in 1971, when he was thirteen; he spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released, and was never criminally charged. Because of this incident – of which Teri Brandt's family was unaware – and because of Charlie Brandt's efficiency in killing his wife and niece and his hidden obsessions with human anatomy, investigators looked into the prospect that he had been a serial killer who had operated without detection since moving to Florida in 1973. Police have positively ascribed up to six homicides to Brandt."

  "text" : "Charles J. Bell (1858-1929) was a Scotch-Irish-Canadian-American businessman, cousin of Alexander Graham Bell, son-in-law of Gardiner Greene Hubbard, and nephew of Melville Bell. Born in 1858 in Dublin, Ireland, he attended Wesley College before emigrating to Canada in 1873. He moved to Washington DC in 1880 to be his cousin's secretary in the new Bell Telephone Company. In 1881 he traveled to Paris to set up branches of the Bell Telephone Company in Europe. That same year he married Roberta Hubbard, daughter of Gardiner Greene Hubbard. She died giving childbirth in 1885, and after her death Bell married her sister Grace Hubbard. In 1888 he co-founded the National Geographic Society, and was its first treasurer. He bought the property for the headquarters of the society, where it still is. Bell died on October 2, 1929."

  "text" : "Clodomir Santos de Morais, PhD (30 September 1928 – 25 March 2016), was a Brazilian sociologist who originated the Organization Workshop (OW) and the associated Activity-based Large Group Capacitation Method (LGCM). In the 1940s and 1950s de Morais worked as a trade unionist and a journalist, becoming a member of the Pernambuco State Assembly and co-founder of the Ligas Camponêsas (Peasant Leagues). After the 1964 coup he was forced into exile, first in Chile, and, as ILO Regional Advisor on Agrarian Reform for Central America, he subsequently worked as Agrarian Reform consultant in Latin America, Portugal and Africa. After the end of military rule de Morais returned to Brazil in 1988, answering a call from the University of Brasilia to help in the 'hidden civil war' of unemployment. He recently returned to his hometown in Bahía State."

  "text" : "Charles W. Piercy (1833-1861), California Democratic politician, and Assemblyman, that as a Douglas Democrat was killed in a duel with a Southern Democrat Assemblyman Daniel Showalter in the last political duel in California. Charles Wesley Piercy, was born, in Decatur County, Iowa, on June 11, 1833 to Nathan Piercy and Elizabeth Scott Piercy. He came across the continent to California in 1852, in a small party one of whom was Daniel Showalter of Pennsylvania, but when they arrived in California they went their separate ways. Piercy settled in El Monte and in 1858 joined with others there in purchasing and reselling the lands of Mormons returning to Utah at the time of the Utah War. Allied to those interests he was elected Sheriff of San Bernardino County in 1859. Piercy resigned in Oct. 1860 to run for a seat in the State Assembly. In the bitterly contested campaign of 1860, Charles W. Piercy was nominated for member of the 1st District of the California General Assembly by one party, and W. A. Conn the incumbent, by the other. Piercy was elected, but there was a claim of fraud. The accusation was that polls at Temescal, maintained by a resident named James Greenwade, kept open shop for three weeks and that whenever candidate Piercy was in need of more votes, they were furnished from this precinct. The case was taken to court, where the two opposing lawyers, H. M. Willis and Bethel Coopwood, had a fight in court wherein Coopwood sustained a slight wound, but won the case. Piercy won his seat as a member of the 1861-62 California State Assembly, representing California's 1st State Assembly District. Piercy and Daniel Showalter, an Assemblyman who represented the Breckinridge Democrats, disagreed over the U.S. Senate election to a point that provoked a duel. On May 25, 1861 their duel with rifles, was held in Fairfax, California at the home of Democrat politician Charles S. Fairfax. After attempts to prevent the duel were made by friends, the first shots were exchanged and both parties missed, Showalter asked for a second firing, and managed to shoot Piercy, who was killed. It was the last duel between political figures in California. Charles W. Piercy was buried in Lone Mountain Cemetery, in San Francisco. When San Francisco passed an ordinance in 1912 evicting all existing cemeteries from city limits the remains of Piercy were sent to Colma."

By the time of his death in August 1993, age 73, Chuan was at the head of one of the three dominant business families in Thailand - the others being the Sophonpanich family and the Lamsam family - and the business group Chuan had created, the Ratanarak Group, included Thailand’s most successful terrestrial broadcaster, a major retail banking and insurance group and the country’s second largest cement producer. Comparing Thai and US entrepreneurs, Professor Krishnamra, head of the Sasin Business School at Thailand’s Chulalongkorn University, has said “given the size of the market and the stage of development, Chuan as an entrepreneur was comparable to the Vanderbilts or Rockefellers”. Chuan is the father of Krit Ratanarak and the grandfather of Chachchon Ratanarak."

  "text" : "Claudio Rocchi (8 January 1951 – 18 June 2013) was an Italian progressive rock singer-songwriter, musician and radio host. Born in Milan, at young age Rocchi was a bassist in the group Stormy Six, with whom he recorded their first album in 1968, Le idee di oggi per la musica di domani. In 1970, he started a solo career, publishing the album Viaggio. In 1971, he released the album Volo Magico numero 1, with which he became a constant presence in all the meetings and the rock festivals of the time. The album was referred as \"one of the definitive albums of the Italian psychedelic music, perhaps the only true classic of the genre ever produced in our country\". He retired in the early 1980s, as a result of personal choices, and then came back in the 1990s. His last album was In Alto, published in 2011. He was also a radio host, best known for the musical program Per voi giovani. Rocchi even founded the first free radio of Nepal \"The Himalayan Broadcasting Company\", of which he was director for three years. He died on 18 June 2013, at the age of 62, of an incurable degenerative disease."

  "text" : "Chen Pokong (born 20 December 1963) is the pen name of Chen Jinsong, a Chinese author and political commentator based in the United States. Born in Sichuan Province, Santai County, Chen is a graduate of Hunan University and Tongji University in China, and Columbia University. As a postgraduate student in 1985, he submitted a joint letter calling for political reform to former Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang. In 1989, he initiated, organized and participated in a student movement in Guangzhou, and also established a \"democracy salon\" in Sun Yat-sen University in January. On April 22, 1989, he joined Chen Wei, Yu Shiwen and other student leaders in launching a democracy movement in Guangzhou Province in support of the student protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. He was arrested for his activism and spent the years between 1989 and 1993 in prison and forced labor. In 1994, he furnished evidence to the United Nations and other international bodies that China was exporting goods produced in labor camps for sale, a contravention of international law and a breach of human rights. Chen came to the United States in 1996, where he attended Columbia University as a visiting scholar and later obtained a master's degree. In the U.S., Chen Pokong regularly appears as an analyst on Chinese current affair programs, including Voice of America, Radio Free Asia, New Tang Dynasty Television, BBC Chinese, and others. He frequently writes political columns for Radio Free Asia, Hong Kong's Open Magazine, and other publications. He is also an author of several books on Chinese political culture, including \"The Unwelcome Chinese,\" “A Hundred Points of Common Sense on China,\" \"A Thick Black Theory of Zhongnanhai,\" and others. In 2007, Chen was awarded the \"Prominent News and Culture Award.\" He currently resides in New York City."

After the aforementioned campaign abruptly ended he launched his own signature line in 2004. The line was available only at his own store on Gansevoort Street in the New York City borough of Manhattan and through an exclusive deal at Saks Fifth Avenue. Nolan died of cancer of the head and neck on January 30, 2011 at the age of 53. He was the partner of the financial writer and Democratic National Committee treasurer, Andrew Tobias."

In 1821 he failed to win reelection, but became a member of the \"College of Community Overseers\" (Kollegium der Gemeindebevollmächtigten, comparable to today's city council). With Johannes Scharrer, he founded the city's first savings bank in 1821. A street in the Gleißhammer section of the city is named for him."

  "text" : "Dr Charles Kearns Deane Tanner (20 September 1849 - 21 April 1901) was an Irish surgeon and politician. Tanner was born in Cork, the son of notable surgeon Dr. William Kearns Deane-Tanner and Eliza Sharpe, educated in Paris and Winchester, and studied arts and medicine at Queen's College, Cork and the Universities of Leipzig and Berlin. He practised as a surgeon at South Cork Infirmary and County Hospital and lectured on anatomy at Queen's College. In the general election of 1885, Tanner was elected MP for the Mid Cork constituency, and was re-elected unopposed for the seat until his death. His involvement in the Parliament was controversial, as his behaviour was often obstructive. The Times remarked after his death that \"it was difficult to regard him as a serious politician ... he came repeatedly under the censure of the Speaker\". The Church Standard remarked that \"there was scarcely a session that he did not make a fierce attack upon the ministry\" and he \"was credited with the record of having been more frequently 'suspended' from the House of Commons for violent speech than any other member of the body\". He was actively involved in the Plan of Campaign, and was a supporter of Parnell until he made an adverse comment about Tanner's father. When the Parnell split occurred, Tanner became an anti-Parnellite. Dr. Charles Kearns Deane Tanners personal politics were at odds with many in his family. This caused quite a bit of controversy within the family. He died in 1901 of consumption and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London next to the grave of his brother Dr. Lombard John Newman Deane-Tanner Dr. Charles Kearns Deane-Tanner was the uncle of early Hollywood Director William Cunningham Deane-Tanner, aka William Desmond Taylor."

Chen was born in what was known as Takao Prefecture, a division of Japanese Taiwan, in 1916. He studied Dutch at the Tokyo University of Foreign Languages, and was also fluent in English, Japanese, Malay, Hoklo and Mandarin. He was sent by the Japanese government to the Dutch East Indies in 1942, shortly after Japan had begun its occupation of the territory. Chen stayed in Indonesia after the end of World War II and found work designing jewelry. He sided with Sukarno in the subsequent Indonesian National Revolution and was imprisoned by the Dutch for a year. After the revolution, Chen joined Thomas Liao's Formosa Democratic Independence Party and helped secure Liao a trip to the Bandung Conference held in 1955. The next year, Liao appointed Chen the ambassador to Southeast Asia upon the formation of the Japan-based Republic of Taiwan Provisional Government. The Indonesian government eventually arrested Chen and rescinded his passport before deporting him. Chen then traveled to Switzerland and was granted citizenship there before moving to Japan to see Liao. The Kuomintang forced Chen's return to Taiwan and asked him to cease his pro-independence advocacy. He did return, but founded another pro-independence organization in 1961. The Taiwan Garrison Command arrested Chen for his actions the next year and imprisoned him in a facility on Qingdao Road in Taipei. In 1963, Chen became the first independence activist to be executed in Taiwan."

His map of a park system for the Salmagundi Club is said to have inspired Frederick Law Olmsted's work. Hermany was also involved in the design of the River Pumping Station for the Cincinnati Water Works. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville His son, Charles Scowden Hermany, lived from 1872 - 1903 and was also buried at Cave Hill Cemetery. In 2009 the Louisville Water Company (LWC) celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Crescent Hill Filtration Plant. Their website notes: \"the opening in 1909 culminated Chief Engineer Charles Hermany's quest for pure water. It marked 30 years of research that included building the Crescent Hill Reservoir and a landmark experiment to develop a purification process for drinking water.\" Hermany worked with George Warren Fuller to complete the project. The designs have even been said to have influenced Frederick Law Olmsted who visited in 1891. A University of Kentucky student compared Hermany's work with that of Marcus Agrippa's in Imperial Rome."

She graduated from the University of Utah with a BA in English in 1975.Ms Luchetti’s Old West ancestry is a factor in her lifelong interest in American frontier life. A great-great grandfather Frederick Waymire was an American farmer and politician who served in the Oregon Territorial Legislature and was a member of the Oregon Constitutional Convention, 1857. Waymire represented the farming contingent at the convention and was characterized as a “sort of Far West David Crockett.” Her maternal great-great-great grandfather, Henry Walker Crabb, was the second vintner in California’s Napa Valley, a gold-seeker who came to California in the 1850s and who in 1874 founded the ToKalon vineyard—located between Yountville and St. Helena. Crabb had brought cuttings of “noble varietals” from France including Black Burgundy, similar to the Refosco of northern Italy."

While not a prolific composer, he was the author of several operettas and ballets which were produced in his native land. His published works were principally for mandolin and guitar or violin and piano, and were issued solely in Italy. Bracco was a cultivated musician and musical conductor in Genoa and Orvieto, Italy. In Orvieto he was conducted the municipal orchestra for several years, and in Genoa conducted the mandolin and guitar band, \"Club Musicale Genovese\"; he dedicated his symphonic overture I mandolini a congresso to the members of this band. Bracco was also conductor of the Philharmonic Society of Certosa, and the Banda Operaia Genovese. His composition I mandolini a congresso (scored for two mandolins, mandola, lute and guitar) was in 1902 awarded the gold medal in the musical competition organized by the proprietors of the mandolin and guitar periodical Il mandolitio of Turin. It appeared originally in the June 1902 number of this journal, and was an immediate and pronounced success being included in the repertoire of all European mandolin bands of importance or note. Philip J. Bone wrote that it was the most classic and original composition for these instruments at the date of its publication, because of its \"tuneful melodies, and interesting changes of tempo, its artistic and effective scoring for each instrument individually…it maintains to the present day its exalted position among original works for mandolin bands.\" The work was popular enough that during the International contests for mandolin bands held at Bologne, France, 1909, so many contestants chose to play I mandolini a congresso that unusual remarks were head from a member of the jury. His work Serenata was performed by Enrico Caruso on a Victor record, Matrix C-23151. Serenata / Enrico Caruso and Matrix B-23151. Serenata / Enrico Caruso."

  "text" : "Charles Loomis Dana (March 25, 1852 – December 12, 1935) was an American physician, professor of nervous and mental disease at Cornell Medical College. Dana was born in Woodstock, Vermont. He attended Dartmouth College, a Phi Beta Kappa member, and graduated in 1872. In 1875, he earned a Masters of Arts and a law degree (LLD) from Dartmouth in 1905. He was interested in medicine and studied briefly with Dr. Boynton in Woodstock. He moved to Washington, DC to serve as a secretary for several years to the U.S. Senator from Vermont. In 1875, he became a private secretary to Spencer Baird, curator then Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. While in Washington, he attended the medical schools at Georgetown University and Columbian College, and earned his medical degree in 1877. He earned a second medical degree in 1878 from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. He interned for two years at Bellevue Hospital in New York under Drs. Austin Flint and Edward G. Janeway. He then opened his medical practice. To supplement his income, he saw patients at the local Marine Hospital from 1879 to 1888. Between 1880 and 1887, he was professor of physiology at the Women’s Medical College (which closed in 1918 and became the New York Medical College). He published his medical lectures and edited the weekly publication, Medical Record, with Dr. Smith Ely Jelliffe. In 1886, he became a Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine, serving as President, 1905-1906; Chair of its Public Health Committee, 1911-1928; and a Trustee, 1906-1934. Dana became interested in neurology through his associations with Drs. Edward Seguin, William Hammond, and George Beard. He joined the New York State Neurological Society in 1881 and the American Neurological Association in 1882, serving as President in 1892. He held the post of professor of Diseases of the Nervous System and Mind at the New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital from 1884 to 1895. He served on the Board of Trustees of the Neurological Institute of New York. From 1902 until his retirement in 1934, he was a professor of nervous diseases at Cornell Medical College. Dana published over 250 articles. His Text-book of Nervous Diseases for the Use of Students and Practitioners of Medicine, first published in 1892, went through ten editions until 1925. His publications attempted to apply new ideas and experimental results from general pathology to neurology, and medical topics included the study of medical psychology, eugenics, and public health. He belonged to many social and literary groups including the Sons of the American Revolution, the Society of Colonial Wars, and the Century Association. He was a founder and member of the Charaka Club in New York (1893-1947), where prominent physicians gathered to discuss literary and historical topics. In 1927, Dana was invited to deliver the John Hughlings Jackson annual lecture at the University of Edinburgh, and was awarded an honorary LLD. He died in 1935 at Harmon-on-Hudson, New York."

  "text" : "Chen Li (1810–1882) was a Cantonese scholar of the evidential research school, known for his contributions to historical Chinese phonology. Chen Li's family originally came from Shaoxing prefecture in Zhejiang province, moving to Nanjing in the early Ming dynasty.Chen's grandfather moved to Guangzhou, where his two sons remained after his death.Chen Li was the first in his family to register as a Guangzhou resident.He passed the provincial examination in 1832, but was unsuccessful in the imperial examination seven times.He also sat examinations at the Xuehaitang Academy in Guangzhou, headed by Ruan Yuan, and taught there as co-director for several decades from 1840. In his pioneering Qièyùn kǎo (切韻考 \"An examination of the Qieyun\", 1842), Chen systematically analysed the pairs of characters (fanqie) used to indicate pronunciations of words in the Guangyun, a Song dynasty redaction of the Qieyun dictionary published in 601.Chen was able to enumerate the initials and finals of the phonological system of these dictionaries, now known as Middle Chinese, and demonstrate subtle differences from those of the later rhyme tables.This analysis would be repeated, though less thoroughly, in the 20th century by the Swedish linguist Bernhard Karlgren, who was unaware of Chen's work at the time.Chen's collected essays (東塾集 Dōngshú jí), published in 1892 after his death, include a much-quoted early description of the phonology of Cantonese in comparison with the categories of Middle Chinese. Chen was one of several Guangzhou scholars who sought to reconcile the moral concerns of Neo-Confucianism with the analytical methods of Han learning, a reaction against Neo-Confucianism (\"Song learning\").In his Hànrú tōngyì (漢儒通義 \"Comprehensive meanings of the Han Confucians\", 1856), Chen defended the philosophical significance of Han learning.In later works he argued that Zhu Xi, the founder of Neo-Confucianism, was also concerned with philology."

  "text" : "Connie Gilchrist (23 January 1865 – 9 May 1946) was a British child artist's model, actress, dancer and singer who, at a very early age, attracted the attention of the painters Frederic Leighton, Frank Holl, William Powell Frith and James McNeill Whistler, the writer and photographer Lewis Carroll and aristocrats, Lord Lonsdale and the Duke of Beaufort. She became a popular attraction on stage at the age of 12 in a skipping rope dance routine at London's Gaiety Theatre, where she was then engaged in Victorian burlesque and vaudeville throughout her formative years. Gilchrist, who became known as the \"original Gaiety Girl\", had abandoned the stage by the time of her marriage in 1892 to Edmond Walter FitzMaurice, 7th Earl of Orkney."

  "text" : "Frances Christine Fisher Tiernan (July 5, 1846 – March 24, 1920), who used the pen name Christian Reid, was a 19th-century American author who wrote over 50 novels including The Land of the Sky. Frances Christine Fisher was the daughter of Col. Charles Fisher, who died at the Battle of Manassas. The Fisher family was rich but the Civil War caused the family to lose much of their money. Fisher made the decision to write using the name Christian Reid, though the family did not like the idea. The family lived at the northwest corner of Fulton and Innes Streets in Salisbury, North Carolina. Fisher donated land for Sacred Heart Catholic Church, dedicated November 19, 1882. She taught cathecism and music. Some critics described the work of Christian Reid as \"a graceful, limpid style\", \"bland\" and \"sylvan romances\". One biography says \"There is in her fiction an over-reliance on the picturesque that was popular in the years following the Civil War. Yet, her work stands apart from the many narratives of travel in Appalachia in its honest and realistic portrait of life in southern society.\" Fisher married James Marquis Tiernan in 1887, and they moved to Mexico. Shortly after they came back to Salisbury in 1887, James Tiernan died. In 1909 Fisher received the Laetare Medal at the University of Notre Dame The United Daughters of the Confederacy built a monument in 1939 on West Innes Street in Salisbury, which was moved in 1955 and again in 1983, this time to the Rowan Public Library. The Confederate Monument in Salisbury was paid for partly from the money Fisher made from The Land of the Sky. She is buried at Chestnut Hill Cemetery in Salisbury. Because a fire destroyed some records in the 1930s, it is not certain which family member is buried where. In 2006 the entire family plot was enclosed by a brick wall, with materials and labor donated by the owners of Taylor Clay Products. A pink granite bench was added and a granite cross was restored."

  "text" : "Chris Salewicz is a Journalist Broadcaster and Novelist who lives in London.He was as a senior features writer for the New Musical Express from 1975 to 1981 where under tutelage of editor Neil Spencer he and other journalists were said to have re-written the book on music journalism. The period Chris spent at NME is regarded by some as a 'Golden Age of Music Journalism'. where, fuelled by the punk rock explosion the whole genre changed into a complex revolutionary socio economic critique rather than the fan club style journalism of the previous decades. Along with other NME's illumini (Tony Parsons and Julie Burchill) of that period Chris's work soon found its way into serious mainstream publications the Sunday Times, the Independent, the Daily Telegraph, Conde Nast Traveller, Q, Mojo and Time Out, he also wrote for The Face magazine. Salewicz's time at the NME helped him forge a unique relationship and friendship with two men who would reshape music in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s: Joe Strummer (of the Clash) and Bob Marley. His journeys with these two men from Trenchtown Ghetto, Jamaican Gun Court to Zimbabwean independence, from Maida Vale Squat to Groucho Club to the search for Garcia Lorca's bones in Andalucía, continued to redefine music journalism. As his subjects influence expanded beyond musical spheres Salewicz's writing and subsequent books on Joe Stummer (Redemption Song) and Bob Marley (The Untold Story) would also expand beyond the music into what made Joe and Bob political and cultural icons. 1995 he and film director Don Letts moved to Jamaica for two years to develop film ideas. Drawing on extensive research, Salewicz embarked on the writing of Third World Cop the most successful film ever in the Caribbean when it was released in 1999. Salewicz is the author of fifteen books, including the acclaimed Rude Boy: Once Upon a Time in Jamaica; Redemption Song: the Definitive Biography of Joe Strummer, an exhaustive, epic biography of the Clash frontman, and Bob Marley: The Untold Story. He was the on-screen narrator in 2010's Beats of Freedom, a documentary feature film – a cinematically-released documentary in Poland - about how Polish rock'n'roll helped bring down Communism. The same year he went into Tivoli Gardens in Kingston to report on the \"Dudus affair\" for The Wall Street Journal. Chris Salewicz lives in London."

  "text" : "Charles Alexander Bruce (11 January 1793 – 23 April 1871) was a soldier, explorer and author who is best known for being the father of the tea industry in India. Bruce's brother Robert first discovered the indigenous Assamese tea plant in 1823 and told Charles of its existence before his death. In 1824, Bruce fought in the First Anglo-Burmese War, during which he was posted to Sadiya and made commandant of a division of gunboats. In 1835, Bruce was charged by the British East India Company to start tea plantations, and in 1836 resigned his commission with the gunboat flotilla when he was appointed as the superintendent of the Assam tea plantations. At first, the East India Company tried to plant Chinese tea in Assam, but the Chinese plants cross-pollinated with the indigenous tea plants and the experiment was considered a disaster. In Sadiya, Bruce, acting on his own initiative, planted a nursery that consisted just of indigenous plants. In 1836, he sent a sample of the manufactured tea to the tea committee in Delhi. Lord Auckland approved this and tea experts stated that the tea was \"of good quality\". By 1837, Bruce had a consignment delivered to the tea committee – the consignment consisted of 46 chests filled with tea from the indigenous plants. Eight chests weighing 350 pounds were sent to be auctioned in London on 10 January 1839. In 1838, Bruce wrote An Account of the Manufacture of the Black Tea, As Now Practised at Suddeya in Upper Assam, By The Chinamen Sent Thither For That Purpose. In 1871, Bruce received the gold medal from the Royal Society of Arts for cultivation of the indigenous tea plants in Assam. Bruce died aged seventy-eight in Assam, where he was buried in the Christian graveyard at Tezpur."

  "text" : "Colin Whatmough (1950 – January 4, 2011) was a creator of loudspeaker designs and the proprietor of Whatmough Monitors, an Australian manufacturer of audio equipment. Whatmough began dissecting loudspeakers and studying the physics of sound re-production at the age of fourteen. In 1976 he founded Whatmough Monitors with the launch of the Whatmough Monitors Mk II (a large transmission line/open baffle hybrid). The Mk II was the first speaker to incorporate a lead dampening lining in its construction. audiophiles. In 2014, Whatmough's head office is located in Clayton, Victoria and the brand is being sold in most states of Australia. Whatmough's speaker designs have won the company many recognition from publications such as Sound & Image and various Audiophile Websites, in both Stereo and Multi-Channel categories. Whatnough speakers have been praised for tonal accuracy, extended frequency range, good transient response, and accurate integration. Whatmough designed speaker prototypes using computer programmes. The prototypes were then tested using Audiophile Studio Recordings of Jazz, Blues and Classical music, because of their wide variety of instruments and high dynamic range. The prototypes were then modified as many times as necessary to achieve the desired result."

  "text" : "Christopher Walsh Atkins (born 7th May 1976) is a British film maker who was jailed for multimillion-pound fraud. Atkins has produced low-budget dramas. In 2007 he directed the BAFTA-nominated documentary Taking Liberties, which criticised the Blair government for undermining civil liberties and featured Atkins' friend, David Bermingham, a banker extradited for fraud. In 2009 Atkins directed Starsuckers, which criticised the media for unethical behaviour and tricked journalists into buying fake stories; part of the film was shown to the 2011 Leveson Inquiry, where he gave evidence. Atkins then made Dispatches documentaries that tricked actors into endorsing fake products and tricked private detectives into investigating complicit individuals. In 2013 he produced and directed an episode of Panorama which alleged that charities such as Comic Relief had made unethical investments. In part of an operation involving over 100 officers from HMRC's Fraud Investigation Service and many arrests, Atkins was arrested in 2012 while living in a £3.5 million house in Hampstead, and released on bail. In 2016, he was found guilty on two counts of \"Conspiracy to Cheat the Public Revenue, theft and fraud\", sentenced to five years in jail and disqualified from acting as a company official for 12 years. The trial found that he had operated the fraud for years, circulating money and creating false invoices to establish a \"web of lies\" to give the appearance of having spent £5.7m on Starsuckers and another film that was never made, in order to obtain public money as relief. Atkins had worked with accomplices and had boasted about obtaining £115,000 of taxpayers' money from Taking Liberties without any checks, and that he is a \"known player.\" The judge said he didn't see why Atkins had tried to use his evidence to the Leveson inquiry to reduce his jail sentence: “what you did say was at the time not accepted by some parties as accurate,” the judge said."

Since this decision, the Bank of England announced in July 2013 that the image of Jane Austen will appear on the £10 note by around 2017.

  "text" : "Charles Prudhomme, M.D. (1908-1988), an African-American physician and psychoanalyst entered the field of psychiatry in the 1930s. He served as the vice-president of the American Psychiatric Association in 1970-1971, the first African-American to gain elected office in the organization. Prudhomme was born in Opelousas, Louisiana. When Charles was three years old, his father developed tuberculosis and the family moved to Denver, Colorado. Along the way, the family stopped in Kansas City, Missouri where Charles and his mother stayed while his father continued to Denver. Charles received his schooling in Kansas City, became a baseball player, and graduated from high school, second in his class. Prudhomme entered the University of Kansas but remained only a short time. Due to segregation laws, he was not allowed to take certain courses or use the university's facilities. He applied for and received a scholarship to Howard University, a historically black college, in Washington, DC, and over the next six years he attended college and worked. He graduated in 1931 and entered the Howard University College of Medicine. He received his M.D. in 1935. He interned in internal medicine at the Freedman's Hospital (now Howard University Hospital) in Washington, DC. During his years at Howard, medical students attended lectures at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a federally funded psychiatric hospital for mental patients. Dr. Benjamin Karpman, a psychoanalyst and forensic psychiatrist, was a member of the hospital staff, and a professor of psychiatry at Howard. Prudhomme attended his classes and wrote his senior paper on suicide which was published in 1938 in the journal, The Psychoanalytic Review. Prudhomme planned to do a psychiatric residency at St. Elizabeth's but he was told that federal legislation, which established the hospital in 1855, enforced segregation. In 1937, he obtained a fellowship at the University of Chicago but was dismayed to learn that he was assigned to work at the Provident Hospital, which provided medical care to black people. He returned to Washington, DC to work at St. Elizabeth's, but he was unsuccessful. In 1940, using his contacts with then U.S. Senator Harry Truman, arrangements were made for Prudhomme to go to Tuskegee, Alabama, and work at the Veterans Administration hospital for black veterans. He met many black psychiatrists who had been trained in Boston by Solomon Carter Fuller (1872-1953), the first American black psychiatrist. Prudhomme remained at Tuskegee until 1943 when the U.S. Army transferred him to Howard University to head the Army Specialized Training Unit. While at Howard, he registered at the Washington School of Psychiatry to study and train under Dr. Freida Fromm-Reichmann, a German psychiatrist. Prudhomme was admitted to the Washington Psychoanalytic Society in 1958, but only after he was required to complete additional training. Prudhomme's writings discuss his experiences with racism, which he encountered throughout his professional career. Prudhomme practiced psychoanalysis in Washington, DC for many years and taught at Howard University. He often pointed to the importance of cultural patterns in the practice of psychiatry. He died of a heart attack in 1988."

Wilson Barrett engaged her for a role in his play The Sign of the Cross which he took on tour of the United States. Riccardo played the role of Ancaria and later played Berenice in the same play. Robert B. Mantell in 1898 who struck by her beauty also cast her in two Shakespeare plays, Romeo and Juliet and Othello. Author Lewis Strang writing in 1899 said Riccardo was the most promising actress in America at the time. Towards the end of 1898 Mantell chose her for another Shakespeare part, Ophelia im Hamlet. Afterwards she was due to join Augustin Daly's Theatre Company but Daly died in 1899. In 1899 she gained her biggest fame by playing Iras in the first stage production of Ben-Hur."

  "text" : "Charles James Herbert de Courcy St Julian (10 May 1819 – 26 November 1874) was a journalist, newspaper owner-editor and the first Chief Justice of Fiji. St Julian's obituary records that he was born in France but other sources suggest London in 1818,. He claimed to be the son of Thomas St Julian, French army officer, and his wife Marian, née Blackwell. However, the Australian academic, Marion Diamond, in her biography of St Julian, claims that he deliberately obscured his origins and that it is likely that his real name was Charles Trout and that his initial training was as a wood and ivory carver. St Julian emigrated to Adelaide in 1837, proceeding in 1839 to Sydney, where he wrote for the Australian Chronicle, and subsequently for the Commercial Journal. In 1843 he joined the staff of the Sydney Morning Herald, which he left four years later for the Sydney Chronicle, afterwards known as the Free Press. In 1849 he rejoined the Herald. St Julian participated in municipal politics, serving on the Waverley council in 1860 and as its chairman in 1861. He went on to serve as an alderman on the Marrickville Borough Council from 1868 to 1871, and as Mayor from 1868-1869 and again in 1871. In February 1870, he became a magistrate. St. Julian remained as Law Reporter for the Herald until 1872, when King Seru Epenisa Cakobau appointed him Chief Justice of Fiji. When Fiji became a British colony in 1874, Governor Sir Hercules Robinson proposed an annual pension of £200 for him, but he died near Levuka, Fiji on 26 November 1874."

  "text" : "CJ Lim (born Chwen Jeng Lim, 1964 in Malaysia) is the Professor of Architecture and Urbanism at The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment at University College London (UCL); and served as Pro-Provost of University College London. He is the founder and director of Studio 8 Architects, a UK-based multidisciplinary and international practice in sustainable urban planning, architecture and landscape, focusing on interpretations of social, cultural and environmental programmes. Along with Bernd Felsinger, Lim leads Unit 10 within The Bartlett School of Architecture's MArch Architecture course. Lim’s research of cities is developed through a new urban paradigm - the 'Smartcity'. The work addresses what the spatial and phenomenological implications are when sustainable design is applied to a city and the role that citizens play in the production of a relevant social space. A central component of the Smartcity is urban agriculture and the establishment of an ecological symbiosis between nature and built form. The Royal Institute of British Architects has awarded Lim the President’s Medals International Teaching Awards for contribution to architectural education on four separate occasions (1999, 1998, 1998, 1997). In 2006, the Royal Academy of Arts London awarded him the Grand 'AJ/Bovis Lend Lease' Architecture Prize. He also won the Worshipful Company of Chartered Architects Award in 2006 and 2007. He received his education at the Architectural Association School of Architecture (AA)."

He was 2 ft 4 in (0.71 m) tall and performed with several groups from the early 1920s through the late 1940s, billed as the smallest man in the world. His small physique was often contrasted alongside larger circus sideshow acts, such as the juvenile obese and the excessively tall. Regarded as a \"highly successful sideshow [novelty]\" and celebrity, Howerton visited the White House and represented recruitment efforts of the United States Marine Corps. He was featured in multiple films, including a role as a Munchkin in 1939's The Wizard of Oz. He retired in 1949."

He was brought back, tried, and imprisoned for bigamy. His publishing company was liquidated. Granville was dining at a London dinner party when a London magistrate (who said that he never forgot a face) asked him for a private word. The magistrate said that they were fellow guests that night, but next morning he would inform the authorities that some years earlier Granville had earlier appeared before him for bigamy, was given bail, and absconded. Granville then fled to Algiers with his secretary and a large cheque from the Oxford and Cambridge Review. He was extradited for embezzlement, but subsequently charged only with bigamy, and was imprisoned although his wives were willing to give him testimonials as a good husband! The story was heard by Arthur Ransome from Ashley Dukes at the Garrick Club forty years later."

  "text" : "Charles Hanford Henderson (December 30, 1861 – January 2, 1941) was an American educator and author. Born in Philadelphia, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1882; was lecturer at the Franklin Institute 1883–86; Professor of Physics and Chemistry in the Philadelphia Manual Training School 1889–91, principal 1893–95; Ph.D. at Zurich in 1892; lecturer on education at Harvard 1897–98; and director Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, 1898–99. Professor Henderson was a major figure in the creation of educational camps for boys. He founded Camp Marienfeld a Summer Camp for Boys and was its headmaster for 17 years, and was headmaster of the Marienfeld Open-Air School at Samarcand, North Carolina, 1914–16. Marienfeld; a pioneer among camps was established by Dr. Henderson in the summer of 1896 in Milford, Pennsylvania, and was moved to Chesham, New Hampshire in 1899 and operated into the 1950s. It was a study camp for boys and stressed the educational program of the progressive camp. Dr. Henderson was an early proponent of manual training and the Arts and Crafts movement in industry. He advocated redesigning the school to suit the nature and needs of the child. Marietta Johnson, the founder of the Marietta Johnson School of Organic Education in Fairhope, Alabama credited Dr. Henderson with having coined the term \"organic education\" in his 1902 book Education and the Larger Life which was one of her educational bibles. Dr. Henderson was then a rival of John Dewey in the education reform movement. Although Dewey grew greatly in stature, Henderson was highly regarded and spent his career implementing reform. He was a prolific author who wrote about progressive education, manual training for boys, the value of hand work and the benefits of summer camps. Dr. Henderson's reputation rests largely on his academic papers published in periodicals such as Popular Science, Harper's Magazine, the Atlantic Monthly and the North American Review. His books include: Elements of Physics (1900); Education and the Larger Life (1902); John Percyfield: The Anatomy of Cheerfulness (1903); Children of Good Fortune (1905); Lighted Lamp (1908); Pay-day (1911); What It Is to Be Educated (1914). In retirement he designed and maintained a summer home in the Arts and Crafts style in the artist’s colony of Tryon, North Carolina. Henderson's winter home was in Daytona Beach, Florida, where he died in 1941."

  "text" : "Cathy Massiter is a British whistleblower and former member of MI5 who revealed that the British security service carried out surveillance of British trade unions, civil rights organisations and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She sustained her revelations via a affidavit. From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, the MI5 designated the CND, an anti-nuclear weapons organisation, as subversive by virtue of its being \"communist controlled\". Communists had played an active role in the organisation, and John Cox, its chairman from 1971 to 1977, was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. From the late 1970s, MI5 downgraded CND to \"communist-penetrated\". In 1985, Massiter, who as an MI5 officer had been responsible for the surveillance of CND from 1981 to 1983, resigned and made disclosures to a Channel 4 20/20 Vision programme, \"MI5's Official Secrets\". She said that her work was determined more by the political importance of CND than by any security threat posed by subversive elements within it, and argued that the organisation was contravening the rules governing its practices. In 1983, she analysed telephone intercepts on John Cox that gave her access to conversations with Joan Ruddock and Bruce Kent. MI5 also placed a spy, Harry Newton, in the CND office. According to Massiter, Newton believed that CND was controlled by extreme left-wing activists and that Bruce Kent might be a crypto-communist, but Massiter found no evidence to support either opinion. CND activist Pat Arrowsmith, who had known Newton for twenty-five years, disputed the veracity of Massiter's allegations against him. On the basis of Ruddock's contacts, she had given an interview to a Soviet newspaper in 1981, MI5 suspected her of being a communist sympathiser. Massiter also revealed the surveillance of Harriet Harman and Patricia Hewitt, who had respectively held the posts of the legal officer and general secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties. Richard Norton-Taylor wrote in 2001 that Massiter's revelations in 1985 had never been officially challenged by the government, although British governments have a tradition of not commenting \"on matters of national security and intelligence.\""

  "text" : "(Not to be confused with Clifford Alexander Jr..) Cliff Alexander (born November 16, 1995) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He completed his freshman season at the University of Kansas for the Jayhawks' on their 2014–15 team. He declared himself eligible for the 2015 NBA draft but was undrafted. He played in high school at Curie High School in Chicago where he won Naismith and Mr. Basketball USA recognition as national player of the year. He did not play organized basketball until eighth grade, but by late in his freshman season he became a notable contributor to his high school's varsity team. He was ranked among the top 20 prospects in the national class of 2014 prior to his sophomore season. As a junior, he moved into the top 10 of the national class and was recognized as an All-American. By the beginning of his senior season, he was considered to be a top 5 player by most talent evaluators and his stock was still on the rise. Following a Martin Luther King Day performance during his senior year against the number one team in the country, many experts considered him to be the best player in the national class of 2014. In 2013, he represented USA Basketball in international play. Several talent scouts praised his powerful game. As a high schooler, Alexander felt he was most often compared to Amar'e Stoudemire. He was also contrasted with crosstown rival Jahlil Okafor, especially as a senior when they vied for national attention. Alexander was heavily recruited by many top Division I basketball programs and his recruitment was widely followed. He played in the 2014 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, 2014 Jordan Brand Classic and the 2014 Nike Hoop Summit, earning co-MVP of the Jordan Brand Classic. Alexander led Curie to the 2014 Chicago Public High School League city championship in a quadruple-overtime game against Okafor that was the lead story on SportsCenter. The championship was later forfeited. As a freshman with Kansas, he did not play in the latter part of the season after the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) launched an investigation into his eligibility."

She debuted in Åbo in 1802, and was active as a concert violinist there until she moved to Sweden in 1805. She was the first professional female violinist in Finland. A student of Erik Ferling, she attracted attention for her talent. She discontinued her career after her marriage with the vicar Johan Annell of Strängnäs in Sweden, because contemporary norm did not regard it suitable for a married woman of her class to perform in public, and then performed only before her friends in private. She returned to Åbo in 1865."

  "text" : "Charles Robert Heinz (December 21, 1942 - April 2011) was a pop and religious singer, and minister of music, in Germantown, Tennessee. His father was an elder in the family's church. In his mid-teens he recorded two of the earliest 45-rpm pop-music records for Satellite Records, which soon became Stax. At 16, he was preparing for the release of \"Destiny\", backed by \"Prove Your Love\". He asked a girl named Freda (whom he would later marry) that he be invited to her 13th birthday party, and they began dating. The flip-side song proved a local hit on release in 1959, but in September 1960, his \"Suddenly\", backed by \"Nobody Cares\", was released, with less success. After dating for three years, he and Freda \"ran away\", and married with her parents permission. He took a job in the management of a retail store, and moved his family to Alabama to take a promotion. Becoming dissatisfied with his work, he moved the family back to Tennessee; his father sensed a spiritual dissatisfaction, and urged a pastor friend to see whether their interests would be as close as he sensed. The son and the pastor found a common ground, and Heinz became involved in the pastor's use of music with this congregation. Heinz found this activity fulfilling, and in time took charge of and developed the music program beyond expectations, and made it his career. In February, 2011, he celebrated his retirement from the ministry, and died in April at the age of 68."

  "text" : "Charles Aubrey Hardwick CMG QC (29 July 1885 – 6 March 1984) was an Australian barrister and judge. Hardwick was born at Rylstone to George White Hardwick and Jane, née Harris. His qualifications were a Bachelor of Arts (1913) and a Bachelor of Law (1915), both from Sydney University; he financed his way through university as a clerk in the public service. While at university he won the Pitt Cobbett Prize for Constitutional Law (1912) and sat on the Committee of the university's Law Society (1913–14, 1915–16). Called to the bar on 2 June 1915, he was employed at the Red Cross Information Bureau during the war, for which he had been considered medically unfit. On 28 October 1922 he married Maisie Jean Fell, with whom he would have two sons. In 1932 he defended Francis de Groot at the trial resulting from de Groot's famous intervention in the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge; he successfully had de Groot released on the grounds of insanity. Hardwick was made King's Counsel on 23 August 1934, and in 1939 was acting judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court's Matrimonial Causes Jurisdiction. He was also involved in politics as a founding member of the United Australia Party, unsuccessfully contesting preselection for the state seat of Gordon in 1937 and running as one of five endorsed UAP candidates for Werriwa at the 1940 federal election. He was also involved in the formation of the UAP's successor, the Liberal Party. Also active in charitable causes, he was a founding member of the council of the New South Wales Institute of Hospital Almoners (Treasurer, 1937–63), vice-chairman of the Metropolitan Hospital Contribution Fund (1938–44) and Director of the Prince Henry Hospital; he also held numerous positions with the Benevolent Society of New South Wales (Director 1947–58, vice-president 1958–61, president 1961–73, vice-patron 1973–84). He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1971. He died in Sydney in 1984."

  "text" : "Concemore Thomas Thwaites Cramp (19 March 1876–13 July 1933), known as Charlie Cramp, was a British trade unionist and political activist. Born in Staplehurst in Kent, Cramp worked as a gardener, before gaining employment with the Midland Railway. He worked as a porter based in Shipley and then Rotherham, where he was promoted to become a guard, and joined the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (ASRS). Soon after, he moved to Sheffield, where he married an Elizabeth Baker, also from Staplehurst. Cramp was an effective trade unionist, and was elected to the executive of the ASRS in 1911, immediately prior to a major strike. The ASRS merged with other unions in 1913 to form the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR). Cramp maintained his position on its executive, working during World War I to oppose further strikes, and was elected as President of the NUR in 1917. He was also appointed as Industrial General Secretary of the union, a full-time position in which he was seen as deputy to General Secretary James Henry Thomas. Cramp was also active in the Labour Party. He stood unsuccessfully for it in Middlesbrough West at the 1918 general election. He was a member of its National Executive Committee from 1919 until 1929, and served as Chair of the Labour Party in 1924/5. The following year, he was elected as President of the International Transport Workers' Federation. In 1929, he was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, serving for three years, thereby swapping positions with Thomas. In 1931, Thomas was given a ministerial position, and Cramp took over as General Secretary, but he died suddenly two years later."

  "text" : "Charles H. Drayton (5 May 1919 Brooklyn, New York – 31 July 1953 Los Angeles) was an American jazz bassist who performed and recorded from the late 1930s until his death with artists that include Louis Jordan, Benny Carter, Dizzy Gillespie, Pete Brown, Ben Webster, Joan Edwards, Timmie Rogers, Savannah Churchill, the Basin Street Boys, Barney Bigard, Billy Holliday, Coleman Hawkins, Woody Herman, Julia Lee, Jack Teagarden, Louis Armstrong, Fletcher Henderson, Russell Jacquet, Marion Abernathy, The Treniers, Billy Taylor, Helen Humes, and Teddy Bunn. In 1946, he played several times with artists at Jazz at the Philharmonic. Drayton's performances — including the known fifty-two jazz recording sessions from 1938 to 1953 — with artists at the vanguard of bebop during the height of its development, placed him in the flow of many historic settings in jazz that marked the careers of musicians. In one such setting, Drayton was the bassist for Ben Webster's first recording session — February 8, 1944, World Broadcasting Systems, New York City — with Hot Lips Page (trumpet), Clyde Hart (piano), Denzil Best (drums). That session has been released multiple times. A 1993 release on CD is titled The Horn, by Progressive Records (OCLC 53833333)."

Relying upon only primary sources and original documents, which took her to distant archival repositories such as the U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C., and London, England to locate original materials, she authored some 23 books, including: \n*  The Troubled Waters of Medicine Creek : An Investigation into the Nature of the Fishing Rights Arising from the Medicine Creek Indian Treaty of 1854 (Thesis, Pacific Lutheran University, 1971)  \n*  They Walked Before : The Indians of Washington State (1977)  \n*  How to Research American Indian Blood Lines : A Manual on Indian Genealogical Research (1984)  \n*  Fort Nisqually : A Documented History of Indian and British Interaction (1986)  \n*  Leschi : Last Chief of the Nisquallies (1986)  \n*  Where the Waters Begin : The Traditional Nisqually Indian History of Mount Rainier (1994)  \n*  The Treaties, The Councils & The Reservation (Washington State Capital Museum, 1992) \n*  The Seasonal Round of Life in Traditional Times (Washington State Capital Museum, 1992) \n*  Tears of Internment : The Indian History of Fox Island and the Puget Sound Indian War (1996)  \n*  The Nisqually—My People : The Traditional and Transitional History of the Nisqually Indian People (2002)  \n*  Remembering Medicine Creek: The Story of the First Treaty Signed in Washington, with Maria Pascually (2005)  \n*  Stolen Lands : The Story of the Dispossessed Nisquallies (2007) \n*  Nisqually Indian Tribe (2008) Carpenter's expertise in writing and disseminating the history of the Nisqually people as a record of and supplement to their rich traditional oral history earned her the office of Nisqually tribal historian, chief consultant on Indian history for the permanent exhibit of the Washington State Historical Society, and curator of the society's Remembering Medicine Creek exhibit at the Washington State History Museum."

  "text" : "Charles Herbert Aslin (15 December 1893 – 18 April 1959) was a British architect. He was born in Ecclesfield, Sheffield, the son of steelworker Arthur William and Louisa Aslin and educated at Sheffield Central School and Sheffield University. During the First World War he served in the Army Pay Corps and the Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry before being made a captain in the Royal Artillery. After the war he was admitted to the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) as an associate, becoming a fellow in 1932. He took a post in the city architect's department in Sheffield, and in 1922 was appointed as borough engineer in Rotherham, where he designed the new municipal offices. After a few years as a lecturer at Sheffield University he became an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers and was appointed deputy county architect of Hampshire. In 1929 he became the Borough Architect for Derby responsible for the planning of major changes in the layout of the town under the title of Central Improvement Plan (CIP). In that role he is credited with the design of several major buildings both within the CIP and also elsewhere in the town, including the original 1933 Bus Station, Police Station/Magistrates' Courts, Council House, Riverside Gardens, Exeter Bridge, Exeter Place Apartments and the former Covered Market. After the Second World War he moved to become county architect of Hertfordshire County Council, where he introduced the concept of pre-fabricated construction techniques to meet an urgent demand for new schools. Over 100 such schools were built over the next decade to his C20 pre-fabricated design. In 1945, he was elected to the council of R.I.B.A. and elected president for 1954-56. He retired in 1958 and died in Hertford in 1959. He had married Ethel Fawcett Armitage, with whom he had one daughter."

She has also worked as an attorney at the Silicon Valley law firm Fenwick & West and as an investigative journalist with the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism as a Fulbright Scholar. Colleen is best known for her patent scholarship, especially her work on patent “trolls” or patent assertion entities (PAEs). She coined the term PAE in a 2010 law review article, and many lawmakers subsequently adopted the term. She has published empirical studies on how patent litigation impacts startups and venture capitalists, and she has been a vocal proponent of reforming the patent system. Colleen's work has received substantial recognition. In 2013, Managing Intellectual Property magazine named her one of the \"Top 50 IP Thought Leaders in the World\" and said that her work has \"led the debate in the US [on patent trolls] and been behind many of the recent proposals for reform.\" In addition, in 2013, she was awarded the inaugural Eric Yamamoto Emerging Scholar Award by the Board of the Conference of Asian Pacific American Law Faculty (CAPALF) and was named a Silicon Valley “Woman of Influence” by the Silicon Valley Business Journal, which called her \"one of the most quotable and frequently consulted commentators on the patent system\" and said she is \"a leader in the national community of intellectual property scholars.\""

His career as a professional artist began while working as an illustrator for the U.S. Army recording and drawing medical illustrations of the wounded and dead during the First World War. He continued the practice in civilian life and became a noted artist-illustrator who worked for a number of prominent magazines, including the Saturday Evening Post, which were very popular during the pre-television era of the 1920s to 1940s. After the Second World War Chickering began working for the U.S. Post office designing U.S. Postage stamps, some of which became famous. Later in life he became a designer and illustrator for first day cover cachets that were also popular among stamp and postal history collectors."

In 1807 he founded the glass factory Gjøvig Glassverk on the other side of the river, creating an industrial environment and laying the grounds for a larger city there. The factory became known for its blue vases, basing the color on cobalt blue from Blaafarveverket and dubbed \"Gjøvik blue\". Near the factory he also erected the administration building \"Kauffeldtgården\". The building still stands, and was preserved in 1985. In the 1830s his son Wexel Hansen Kauffeldt took over most of the factory administration. It was discontinued in 1843, and Caspar Kauffeldt died in the same year."

  "text" : "Caterina Dolfin (Venice, 8 May 1736 - Venice, 14 November 1793) was an Italian (Venetian) poet. Caterina was the daughter of the Nobilhuomo Ser Antonio Giovanni Dolfin and the Nobildonna Donata Salamon, members of a secondary branch of one of the most ancient families of venetian aristocrary. Caterina's father was knowned to have squandered the family fortune, leaving serious debts to his wife and daughter uppon his death in 1753. In 1755, the young \"nobildonna\" made a suitable marriage with Marcantonio Tiepolo, a member of another influential noble family which had the means to relieve the Dolfins of their debts. The marriage of Caterina with Marcantonio Tiepolo achieved great notoriety in Venitian society. It is understood that in 1756, only months after her marriage, Caterina entered into a relationship with Andrea Tron, a Statesman, and also member of the aristocrary, although not of the antiquity of the Dolfins. Very shortly after her affair began, Caterina filed for divorce, the matter was subject of great scandal, but it's records, preserved until this day, have been of great interest for academics, containing a rich testimony of the rules, customs and social complexity of Venitian aristocracy. After years of scandal, the divorce was granted in 1772, upon which she married Tron, who used his marriage to enter the tightest circles of society, and stately institutions, achieving the prestigious office of \"Procurator of Saint Mark\", next most important post to that of Doge. From then on, Caterina Dolfin Tron was known as the \"Procuratessa\". In 1757, Caterina made her debut as a writer under a pseudonym. Her most famous work was a collection of sonets inspired by her father, which were published in 1767-68. She was a center of a circle of intellectuals and held a prestigious literary salon. Among her guests were Gaspare Gozzi. In several testimonies of her time, Caterina Dolfin was described as a beautiful, kind, cultivated and refined woman, admired for her brilliant conversation, her graceful poetry and prose. She was also an assistant of Gasparo Gozzi. In 1772, Dolfin was famously called before the Venetian Inquisition because of some of the contents of her library, which were reported to have ideas from the Enlightenment. Along with her poetry, famous entertaining and intellectual relevance, Caterina Dolfin never seized to shock Venitian society with her scandalous affairs. One of her most well known lovers was probably the twenty seven year old Gian Galeazzo Serbelloni, Duke of San Gabrio. According to their correspondence, still preserved until today, it is understood that the affair could have begun in 1773. There was a known occasion when Princess Gonzaga, close friend of Caterina, asked her to her present her to Venitian society during her visit to the city. The Princess had also been the subject of many scandals. When arriving at the Ducal Court, the noble ladies of the Venetian aristocracy refused to talk to her. However, Caterina Dolfin said out loud: \"Ladies, this is Princess Gonzaga, she as I belongs to an illustrious family, as for many of you, I could not say.\" In 1778, Andrea Tron, Caterina's husband was elected senator. However, he lost the 1779 election to become Doge of Venice despite being one of the two main candidates. This is partially attributed to the political scandals surrounding Caterina at that time, as was her involvement in the \"Gratarolo Affair\", named after Secretary of State Antonio Gratarolo. The case consisted in a series of courtly intrigues to get the post of Ambassador to the Duchy of Savoy for one of two candidates, one supported by Gratarolo, and the other by Caterina Dolfin. In 1772, Gratarolo had defeated Caterina's candidate. In 1775, a theatrical play supposedly commissioned by Caterina, exposed Gratarolo's intrigues and affairs. In the same year of her husband's candidacy for Doge, Gratarolo answered the insult with another play, which caricatured Dolfin and her social circle, exposing her love affairs and staining her name and reputation publicly. The play destroyed Andrea Tron's possibilities to become Doge, although the victorious candidate candidate turned out to have a spouse even more unsuitable for the title of Dogaressa, Margherita Delmaz, but is reported to have bribed many of the electors to assure her acceptance. Caterina Dolfin became a widow in 1785. She was left a fortune but became entangled in a dispute with her former in-laws. From 1788, she spent more time in her house in Padova. Her last years, she worked on a project for the reform of female education, which does not appear to have been finished before her death."

She also appeared as a guest on YACHT's third album, I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real. Known for her androgynous onstage persona as a performer, she has been called a \"neo-Annie Lennox\" by the New York Times. NPR music journalist Bob Boilen has referred to her as \"one of the most striking performers I've seen in a rock band.\" In addition, Evans is a science journalist, with a popular science and culture blog, Universe, hosted by National Geographic's Scienceblogs network. Her essay for Universe, \"Moon Art: Fallen Astronaut\" was anthologized in The Best Science Writing Online 2012. She is the co-author of New Art/Science Affinities, a book about contemporary artists working at the intersection of science and technology. In an interview with the contemporary art blog Bad At Sports, Evans called the book \"an attempt to document an emergent form of art practice in a micro-encyclopedic tome.\" She is also the author of a collection of essays called High Frontiers, published by Publication Studio, a small press in Portland, Oregon. USA Today called the book, \"sharp, short and accessible to scholars as well as those of us who don't read much science writing.\" In August 2013, she became the editor-in-chief of OMNI Reboot, a new online version of the science magazine OMNI. She is currently the Futures Editor of Motherboard, Vice (magazine)'s technology and science website. She is a member of the feminist collective Deep Lab."

  "text" : "Claude Thomas Alexis Jordan (29 October 1814, Lyon – 7 February 1897, Lyon) was a French botanist and taxonomist. Born into a wealthy family, he chose a career path in natural history rather than becoming a businessman like his father. From 1836 to 1877 he traveled widely throughout France, collecting many botanical specimens on trips to the Massif Central, the Alps, the Pyrenees as well as on excursions to locations near Lyon. As a member of the Linnaean Society of Lyon, he came under the influence of several local naturalists, including Marc Antoine Timeroy, an amateur botanist who would have a profound impact upon his career. At Jordan's extensive botanical garden in Lyon, with his assistant Joseph Victor Viviand-Morel, he cultivated many thousands of different varieities of plants. Known for his micro-morphological analysis of plants — as a taxonomist he proposed a narrow conceptualization for the determination of species. Because of this, he was widely criticized for his tendency to differentiate species too finely. In regards to the 1,685 species that he named, Johannes Paulus Lotsy referred to them as \"Jordanianas\", while Georges Coutagne called them \"Jordanias\". In a September 15, 1874 issue of Revue des deux Mondes, Jules Émile Planchon published an article regarding Jordan's narrow division of species, titled \"Le morcellement de l'espèce en botanique et le Jordanisme\" (The fragmentation of botanical species and \"Jordanism\"). During his lifetime, he created one of the largest herbariums known to exist, as he acquired exsiccatae series from around 200 other botanists. In 1849 the plant genus Jordania was named in his honor by Pierre Edmond Boissier and Theodor von Heldreich. He also has several species named after him; Rosa jordani (Désègl.) and Viola jordani (Hanry) being a couple of examples."

A few tables and six apostles painted on the pillars of the Dominican Church of San Pablo in Seville, which corroborates his being a disciple of Juan de Valdés Leal. De Torres visited the Court of Madrid in 1724and established a friendship with Antonio Palomino, the official painter of the Court, to which he devoted a complimentary poem. He returned to Cádiz, where he continued to paint until his death in 1730."

The 1395 obituary of Cobhlach Mór mentions that she was married several times, first to Niall O’Donnell, Lord of Tirconnell, then to Aodh O’Rourke, Lord of Breifne, and finally to Cathal, son of Aodh Breifneach O’Connor, the ‘royal heir’ (ríoghdhamhna) of Connacht. In the Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland, Mor is referred to as \"Port na-d-Tri Namhat\" (trns. the port or harbor of three enemies) because her three husbands were enemies of one another. She was interred in the monastery of Boyle."

The Cimmerians changed the name of their tribe to Sicambri in honor of Cambra. Cambra's son by Antenor, Priamus the Younger, succeeded his father when he was twenty-six. According to John Tritemicus, Cambra was so beautiful and wise that the Frankish monarchy obeyed her as if she was an Oracle, and she converted the people to civility from barbarianism. The Saxons, who apparently identified Cambra with the same status as that of a King or priest, developed the proverb Sy Camber, used to refer to any man who spoke as wisely as Cambra. According to John Lewis's history of Great Britain, Cambra taught Noblemen to build cities and castles; she taught women how to dress properly and to use modest countenance, how to sow flax and hemp, and to convert it into cloth; she gave laws and upright judgement to the people; she was a prophet and a priest to Diana; she made the laws of the Sycambrians, by which it was forbidden that the King's sons by second or third wives (etc.) should be called \"princes\", lest the Kingdom should be confounded. She built the cities Neomag and Neopag and \"died around the Year from the Creation 3590, and before Christ 373, Jonathas being High Priest of the Jews.\""

He was one of the most prominent film directors and screenwriters in pre-Communist China, together with Shi Dongshan, Cai Chusheng, and Zheng Junli. His most famous film was Women Side by Side (1949). Chen was abandoned as an infant, and then lost his both foster parents during early childhood. Before becoming a film director, Chen worked mainly in drama. His patriotic play Put Down Your Whip was highly influential and performed countless times during the Japanese invasion of China. During the war he also made a famous staging of the play Qu Yuan, and wrote one of the first Chinese books on film theory. After the early 1950s, Chen's attempts at filmmaking were repeatedly thwarted by the PRC government for political reasons. He worked as general manager of Tianma Film Studio before being imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution. After his rehabilitation at the end of the period, he spent three years on the historical film Da Feng Ge, but retired after that film was also cancelled due to politics."

  "text" : "Cornelis Hendrikus Elleboogius (Elleboog) (1603–1701) was a Dutch Reformed theologian. C. H. Elleboogius was born in 1603 at Schiermonnikoog. He studied at the University of Franecker between 1642 and 1644 under Johannes Maccovius. After the death of Maccovius, Elleboogius went to Utrecht where he studied under Gisbertus Voetius. His classmates included Simon Oomius and Petrus van Mastricht. Along with these fellow disciples of Voetius, Elleboogius is considered a lesser-known figure of the Nadere Reformatie. Elleboogius and Voetius were said to be “joined at the hip” (onafscheidelijk). After failing to convince the desire of his heart, Anna Maria van Schurman, to abandon the pietism of Jean de Labadie, Elleboogius retreated to Scotland where he served as Professor extraordinarius in theology at the University of Aberdeen. In his writings, Elleboogius showed an expert knowledge of rabbinic Hebrew as he argued against the theories of Thomas Gataker and Louis Cappel, who denied the Hebrew vowel points were an original part of the Hebrew language. He also held to the doctrine of synchronic contingency associated with Scotism and Reformed Orthodoxy. He left behind various academic disputations and a commentary on the Song of Songs, Huwelijks-Verbond en Borgtocht (1678). Recent scholarship now disputes whether Elleboogius remained committed to synchronic contingency over the course of his entire life. In a doctoral dissertation Scotus Enervatus: Non habenti aufertur quod videbatur habere (1693), his younger brother, Frederik Willem Pieter Elleboogius, included a dedication to C.H. Elleboogius, in which F.W.P. Elleboogius, \"like his brother, points out that the idea in Scotus of contingency is not so different from that of Thomas [Aquinas]\"."

In 1738, Emperor Charles VI had ennobled them by creating them Barons, for their services in the Habsburg Netherlands. Charles-Auguste was the youngest son of Baron Jean-Théodore de Tornaco. In his early life, he was a cuirassier officer in the Austrian military. He left the army to become a noble member of the second chamber of the Dutch Estates-General. Under the French occupation, Napoleon named him mayor of Luxembourg City by decree on 5 April 1811, an office he held until June 1814. He cared for the good of the city with a deep sense of duty, and also managed to represent the city's interests to the occupying forces. Of particular note is his care for the typhus-afflicted soldiers in the city. Under William I he remained a member of the Estates-General. Tornaco was an ardent champion of the cause of the pro-Dutch Orangists, who wanted the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to remain in personal union with the Dutch King, and he rejected the Belgian Revolution of 1830. His two sons, who were more vehently active against the Belgian cause, were even decried as the \"Tornaco mob\". From 1818 to 1827 he was mayor of Sanem, where the De Tornaco family were the lords of the castle. Charles Auguste married Elisabeth de Berlo-Suys (1775-1856) on 11 November 1800 at Berloz. The couple had three children: \n* Sidonie de Tornaco (1804-1876) \n* Victor de Tornaco, Prime Minister of Luxembourg \n* Mathilde de Tornaco (1813-1885), married Florent de Berlaymont (1815-1884) on 21 May 1840"

He was Prince (batoni) of Mukhrani and ex officio commander of the Banner of Shida Kartli and Grand Master of the Household (msakhurt-ukhutsesi) at the court of Kartli from 1735 and 1756. Constantine was a military commander under his suzerains, Georgian kings Teimuraz II and Heraclius II. He served as a governor (mouravi) of Tbilisi. As a measure against the marauding Lesgian raids, he fortified the fortresses of Ksani, Mchadijvari, and Shiosubani. In 1749, he took part in a successful military expedition undertaken by the Georgian kings to defend the Erivan Khanate from the Turkic Tarakama tribe. From 1754 to 1755, he was involved in the defense of Georgia's frontier from the Avar Khanate. He was killed in a clash with the Lesgians in 1756 and interred at the Cathedral of Mtskheta. Since his sons were still in their minority, Constantine's titles and properties passed on to his family member, Simon."

  "text" : "Caroline (Karolina Juliana Anna Ulrika) Lewenhaupt (1754, Oberbronn - 1826 Linköping), was a Swedish courtier, poet and amateur actor. Caroline Lewenhaupt was the daughter of Count Adam Lewenhaupt and Carolina Christina Anna Louise Sinclair, and married her cousin Count Charles Emil Lewenhaupt in Strassburg in 1778. She was brought up in France, and was described as witty, intelligent and jolly. Caroline Lewenhaupt had a long career at the royal Swedish court. She was hovfröken (maid of honor) to Queen Sophia Magdalena in 1771-1774; kammarfröken (a higher rank of maid of honor) with Princess Charlotte in 1774-1776; and statsfru (Lady of the Bedchamber) with Queen Sophia Magdalena in 1781-1795. She was considered suitable in the role of cheering up the reserved Queen Sophia Magdalena, and she was reportedly well liked by her, and was present at the death of the Queen in 1813. Caroline Lewenhaupt played a notable part in the famous amateur theater in the royal court of King Gustav III of Sweden. In the Christmas of 1775 at Gripsholm Castle, the monarch founded a theater society to organize the popular amateur theater at the royal court: in it, Caroline Lewenhaupt was appointed chairperson, \"Grand Mistress\", while Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna became the official poet and orator of the theater order. The most noted of the actors in the amateur theater of Gustav III were named as Caroline Lewenhaupt, Carl von Fersen, Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie, Nils Barck, Maria Aurora Uggla, Otto Jacob von Manteuffel Zöge, Bror Cederström and the sisters Ulla von Höpken and Augusta Löwenhielm, and Lewenhaupt and Uggla were counted as the Primadonnas of the amateur theater: they often played the leading parts. The 7 January 1776, for example, she played the part of Countess in La Gageuse with Gustav III as the Colonel, in which, according to Fredrik Sparre, the French Ambassador claimed that the part could not have been better given at any theater in Paris. In January–June 1811, she served as överhovmästarinna (Mistress of the Robes) for the Crown Princess, Désirée Clary. Reportedly, she was harassed by the Crown Princess who was encouraged by Elise la Flotte, who wanted her position. She became Mistress of the Robes of Queen Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte in 1818. Caroline Lewenhaupt were also literary active. She is noted to have written many of the texts to the poems which were read at different occasions at court. In 1825, she published Les apparitions. Mélo-drame. Représenté devant la famille royale le 30 janvier 1825./(C.L.) (Stockholm, imprimé chez Charles Deleen, 1825.)"

  "text" : "Charles-Jean-Marie Alquier (13 October 1752 - 3 February 1826), was a French diplomat. He served as French minister in several European capitals. Alquier was born in the village of Talmont, near Les Sables d'Olonne, in La Vendée. He was mayor of Rochelle in 1789, and was elected by the district of Aunis to the Estates-General. He was a member of the Constituent Assembly, and served on several committees; he became one of the secretaries of the Constituent Assembly. When the Assembly adjourned, he became President of the Criminal Tribunal of the Department of Seine et Oise, and was sent as their representative to the National Convention in 1792. In that Convention, he voted for the death of King Louis XVI. He assisted in the organization of Holland after its conquest by the French armies. In 1795 he was appointed Secretary to the Council of Ancients, one of the organs of the Constitution of the Year III under the Directorate. He began his diplomatic career in 1798 with the appointment as Minister Plenipotentiary to Bavaria, where he served until March, 1799, at the approach of war. Back in France he was made Receiver-General of the Department of Seine et Oise, but on the overthrow of the Directory on the 18th of Brumaire, he returned to the diplomatic service on behalf of the new Consulate. In March, 1800, he was appointed by First Consul Bonaparte and Foreign Minister Talleyrand as Minister in Madrid. When he was replaced in Madrid at the end of 1800 by Lucien Bonaparte, he was sent to Florence in February of 1801, as Minister Plenipotentiary, to arrange peace with France. He conducted the negotiations which regularized the French conquest of Tuscany by its formal cession to France. He moved to the Court of Naples in March and became French Minister there in April, 1801. One of his notable achievements was the dismissal of Lord Acton, the Neapolitan prime minister, in 1804. When a combined British-Russian fleet and army entered the ports of the Kingdom, Alquier left Naples. At the end of 1805 he was transferred to Rome to substitute for Cardinal Fesch, Napoleon's uncle, who had gone with Pope Pius VII to Paris. He returned to Paris in February, 1808. In 1810-1811, he was sent to Stockholm as Envoy Extraordinary, and served as Minister in Stockholm, and in 1811-1814 in Copenhagen. His mission was to enforce the \"Continental System\" of Napoleon against the British and Russian commercial interests. In 1813, he concluded a defensive-offensive alliance with Denmark. With the fall of Napoleon Alquier was recalled, and with the return of the Monarchy under Louis XVIII, he was condemned to exile as a regicide. He was allowed to return to France in 1818, with the consent of the King. He died in Paris on February 4, 1826."

In 2006, Estey came under investigation by the Lottery for alleged incidents of domestic violence against his wife, and for lying to Nevada gaming regulators about the incidents. Faced with the threat of losing Dotty's lottery retailer contract, Estey was forced to sell Dotty's locations in Oregon to a group of investors from South Dakota, including Dan Fischer and Marwin Hofer, at a sales price reportedly higher than $15 million. Estey has donated money to RightChange.com, a group dedicated to electing conservative Republicans. Estey was also a major donor to Super PACs supporting Mitt Romney in 2012."

  "text" : "Claire Kelly (March 15, 1934 in San Francisco, California – July 1, 1998 in Palm Springs, California) was an American actress. Born Claire Ann Green, the daughter of a wealthy California rancher, she was trained at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. Kelly started out as a model in Miami, and appeared several times on the cover of McCall, continuing her modelling career throughout the 1950s. She made the cover of Picture Week in 1956, and was a 1958 Deb Star. Kelly went on to starring roles in films such as The Badlanders (1958), Ask Any Girl (1959) and A Guide for the Married Man (1967). In The Badlanders, a western remake of the film noir The Asphalt Jungle, she played \"the Angela role immortalized by Marilyn Monroe\"  in the original film. In 1959 she was publicized as \"the screen's most exciting discovery since Rita Hayworth\". In 1964-65 she appeared in several episodes of the television series Burke's Law. From 1951 to 1955 Kelly was married to singer-comedian George DeWitt, using the name Claire DeWitt in Son of Sinbad, after which she was seen publicly with Lance Reventlow, son of wealthy heiress Barbara Hutton, singer Frank Sinatra, hotel heir Conrad \"Nicky\" Hilton, Jr., and actor Perry Lopez, whom she briefly married in 1960-1961, after which she married wealthy banking heir Robert Alan Kenaston, Jr. (d. 1995), son of actress Billie Dove, in 1961-1963, followed by wealthy Robert Murphy. She once dismissed Prince Aly Khan as \"gauche\" and Elvis Presley as \"a mere child\". On November 6, 1954 Kelly's 3-year-old son Nicholas Christopher DeWitt died after fighting for three days in an iron lung at Variety Children’s Hospital in Miami, Florida, the victim of a rare anesthetic hazard, which happened after he was bitten on the lip by Duke, a cocker spaniel owned by former featherweight champion Willie Pep, and his heart stopped beating as doctors repaired the damage with 25 stitches."

Pulitzer Prize-winning poet John Ashbery selected Hosea's first poetry collection, Put Your Hands In, for the Walt Whitman Award from the Academy of American Poets. Ashbery, in his judge's citation for the Walt Whitman Award, wrote that Hosea's poetry \"somehow subsumes derision and erotic energy and comes out on top.\" Reviewers of Put Your Hands In have highlighted the book's emphasis on contradiction, the absurd, and sound, comparing it to poetry by Language poets. Critic Stu Watson described Hosea's poetry as \"not a confession but a revelation,\" calling it the product of \"an impossibly refined imaginative vision, a vision that, remarkably open to interpretation, manages to reveal almost nothing about its creator, the poet beyond the page, while disclosing volumes about the contemporary reality in which that poet lives.\" Cristina M Rau critiqued the book's \"distracting...references to hyper-contemporary technology that simply does not seem to fit: iPhones, Facebook, Uggs, Instagram,\" but added that \"The pieces confuse and delight and reveal in a mostly successful way.\" Publishers Weekly found that Put Your Hands In \"juggles sexualized imagery, contemporary and historical pop cultural references, and an inventive approach to language that is as relentlessly provocative as it is approachable.\" Library Journal described Hosea's poetry as an \"energized, tumbling mass of tight-stitched imagery\" that \"presents a sort of nutty roadshow of American culture.\" Hosea's second book of poems, Double Zero, was published in 2016 by Prelude. Poet Ben Fama called the collection \"by turns melancholy, fragmented, and true to feeling....a book-length artist statement via linguistic selfies,\" and claimed that Double Zero \"accurately maps the experience of the contemporary subject.\" Hosea is curator of the Brooklyn-based Blue Letter Reading Series, which was named \"Best Reading Series (Poetry)\" in New York City by The L Magazine. Hosea is the recipient of fellowship residencies from Vermont Studio Center and Writers Omi Ledig House. Hosea's visual and conceptual artwork is represented by Brooklyn gallery Transmitter."

Lundh spent the summers of 1883 and 1889 in Skagen. During his first visit, he lived together with Christian Krohg and the Swedish painters Johan Krouthén and Oscar Björck in the house on Markvej which Michael Ancher and his wife Anna bought in 1884. Lundh became Helga Ancher's godfather at her Christening in October 1883. In 1883, Lundh travelled to Persia, where he remained until his return to Skagen in 1888. There are, however, no records of his paintings from 1888. After his second stay in Skagen, he abandoned painting and turned to forestry."

  "text" : "Carl Anton Ludwig Maria Schwaner (16 February 1817 in Mannheim – 30 March 1851 in Batavia) was a German geologist and naturalist. He studied geology and mineralogy in Heidelberg, afterwards being associated with the museum of natural history in Leiden. In 1842, on a recommendation from Coenraad Jacob Temminck, he became a member of the Natuurkundige Commissie voor Nederlandsch Indië (Scientific commission of the Dutch East Indies). He arrived in Batavia of the Dutch East Indies in August 1842, and following certain delays, traveled to Borneo in order to conduct geological investigations. From 1843 to 1848, he performed geological, topographical, zoological and ethnographical research on Borneo. From November 1847 to February 1848, he trekked from the southern town of Bandjermasin, through the interior of the island, to Pontianak on its western coast; thus becoming the first European to accomplish such a feat. In 1848 he returned to Batavia in order to evaluate his findings. Here he died three years later from a fever just prior to embarking on another scientific mission to Borneo. He was founder of the Natuurkundige Vereeniging in Nederlandsch-Indië, serving as its president until late 1850. A small portion of his Indonesian collections later became part of the Rijksmuseum in Leiden. The Schwanergebirge (Schwaner Mountain Range) of Borneo is named in his honor."

  "text" : "Christopher Doohan (born June 28, 1959) is one of the sons of Star Trek actor James Doohan. Chris and his twin brother, Montgomery, made uncredited appearances as background extras in the first Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Upon hearing that the role of Montgomery Scott would be recast for J.J. Abrams' film, Star Trek fans started a campaign asking other fans to write to Paramount Pictures in an attempt to persuade the studio and the filmmakers to allow either Chris or his brother, Montgomery, to play their father's role in the film, or, at the very least, to be extras in the film as they were for The Motion Picture. The role of Scotty in the new film went to British actor Simon Pegg, but on November 5, 2007 it was announced that Doohan had auditioned for a \"minor speaking role\" in the film. Doohan stated he would not have even won an audition had it not been for the support of the fans. He appeared alongside Scotty, assisting him in operating the transporter controls during the mission to the Narada. In 2012, It was announced that Chris Doohan won a credited speaking role in Star Trek Into Darkness as a Transport Officer. In 2012, it was announced that Doohan would play Scotty in Star Trek Continues, a web-based film series. The first episode \"Pilgrim of Eternity\" premiered at the Phoenix Comicon to a crowd of over 3,500 fans. With most of the cast in attendance, they signed posters in the lobby for almost three hours. The second episode, \"Lolani\", premiered in March 2014 at the Dallas, Texas Comic Con. The episode also stars Lou Ferrigno and Erin Gray. He also appears as Scotty in Star Trek Online, with a major appearance in the \"Agents of Yesterday\" expansion pack released in July 2016."

  "text" : "Dr. Charles Medom Hansen (Louisville, Kentucky, 1938) is an American-born scientist with Danish ancestry who is now a Danish citizen living in the Copenhagen area. After a degree (1961, Louisville) and Masters (1962, Wisconsin) in chemical engineering, Hansen worked for his PhD at the Technical University of Denmark, initially on the problems of solvent retention in polymers, starting his life-time interest in diffusion science. However, the problems of predicting the compatibility of solvents with polymers took over, leading him to overcome the problems of the then-popular Hildebrand solubility parameter by dividing Hildebrand's single parameter into three components: dispersion, polar and hydrogen bonding. His 1967 doctoral thesis (Dr. techn.) provided the basis for what came to be called Hansen solubility parameters, or HSPs. In addition to providing a theoretical framework, the thesis provided the first working set of HSP values for common solvents and for a range of commercial polymers, making it of immediate practical use to academia and industry. His theories were put to immediate use during his 8 years (1968–76) at the R/D Center, PPG Industries in Pittsburgh where the universality of HSP became apparent as they were shown to work equally well for problems such as optimising the compatibility of pigments within paint and ink formulations. Gradually they became adopted more widely as shown by the cumulative graph of Google Scholar citations for the phrase \"Hansen Solubility Parameter\". He was Director of the Scandinavian Paint & Printing Ink Research Institute in Hørsholm, Denmark from 1976–85, a Senior Scientist at Hempel Group 1985-87 then Senior Scientist at FORCE Technology, Copenhagen from 1988-2004. Upon retirement he became, and remains, an independent consultant. In addition to over 130 published papers and 8 patents (h-index 25), he authored Hansen Solubility Parameters – A User's Handbook in 1999 followed by an expanded 2nd Edition in 2007. With Abbott and Yamamoto he authored the package of software, eBook and datasets called Hansen Solubility Parameters in Practice, in 2008 which is currently in its 5th Edition."

They are both known for their roles in the 1984 horror film Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter as Tina and Terri. Camilla's most recent film is the 1997 film Dead Tides. Her well known TV role was in the soap operas Days of Our Lives as Gillian Forrester from 1986–87; she took over the role that her sister had played from 1987-88. She has made guest appearances on TV shows such as The A-Team, Cheers, Matlock, Baywatch, and Baywatch Nights. Camilla stepped into the role of Anna Devane from 1991–92, a popular character of \"General Hospital\" which had been vacated by Finola Hughes who had played Anna since 1985. Fans were outraged and in response, the character was killed off in a Yacht Explosion. Finola would later resurrect the character."

  "text" : "Carl Heins (1859 - 10 September 1923) was a German pianist, and a composer of light salon music in classical music style. He wrote both solo piano works and parlor songs. Hein's pieces show a special pianoesque ability to fashion pretty melodies picturesqely in the salon style of the time. His competentcy on the keyboard led him to perform and compose. He composed the song 'Zwei Dunkle Augen', which was recorded by the tenor Fritz Wunderlich. Heins possibly had roots in Bavaria — one of his other better-known pieces is 'Die Schwarzwälder Uhr' (the Black Forest clock). Stylistically his music is similar to that of his older compatriot Carl Böhm and much of it sounds like the sort of music one might hear played on a zither in an Alpine inn. Robert Leonhardt an operatic baritone who sang with the New York Metropolitan Opera company between 1913 and 1922 made numerous recordings for many major record labels, both in Europe and in the United States. An early recording he made on Gramophone 42325 with matrix number 1113B[54] was \"Zwei dunkle Augen\" by Carl Heins. Leonhardt recorded it onto a 78rpm on October 1901 when he was 24."

  "text" : "Charlotte Metcalf (born 1958) is a British documentary film director and producer. She is also a prolific writer and journalist. Her films cover subjects from corporate greed in America to transsexual prostitution and born-again Christianity. Her work has been commissioned and broadcast by the BBC, Channel Four, ITV and CNN. She has made films in Africa on cultural practices such as female genital mutilation, child marriage and marriage by rape and abduction or Raptio. Her film about William Hague, Just William...and Ffion, was said to break the mould of political documentary. Metcalf's documentary \"Schoolgirl Killer\", made for BBC Television in 1999, exposed the story of Aberash Bekele, a 14-year-old girl abducted and raped into marriage. Aberash escaped and shot her abductor when he gave chase. She was arrested for murder and put on trial, defended by the newly formed Women Lawyers Association. Metcalf managed to get into the courtroom to film, and Aberash was eventually acquitted. The documentary also included Aberash's older sister, Mestawet, who was on the point of leaving Ethiopia and taking her place as a runner in the Olympic Games, when she was abducted into marriage. Metcalf filmed Mestawet in her hut, living with three children and her husband, serving home-brewed liquor for a living. BBC audiences were deeply affected by the film and sent in ample funds to give Aberash a safe, boarding-school education. An indefatigable lawyer on the case, Meaza Ashenafi, is one of the characters in a story based on a similar tragic theme, which was made into a drama feature in 2014, called DIFRET and executive produced by Angelina Jolie. Metcalf has also made many films for the United Nations and for clients including Tesco, Unilever, the Labour Party, the International Olympic Committee and art galleries such as Robilant + Voena. She made the first party political broadcasts for Tony Blair and New Labour, including Clause Four."

  "text" : "Carmelo G. Garcia is an American politician from the state of New Jersey. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented the 33rd Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly. Garcia was born in 1975 and lived in Hoboken his entire life. He is a graduate of Seton Hall University where he received a Bachelor of Science in criminal justice and sociology and received a Master of Science from Stevens Institute of Technology in information systems and management. In 2002, he became a member of the Hoboken Board of Education, a position he continues to hold today. After serving as director of human services under Hoboken mayor Dave Roberts, he was appointed to head the Hoboken Housing Authority in 2009. He is the first Latino to hold the position. In 2013, Garcia ran for the General Assembly in the June Democratic primary election on a ticket with State Senator Brian P. Stack and Raj Mukherji but in April, was ruled ineligible to run for the seat. Judge Peter F. Bariso ruled that since the Hoboken Housing Authority received federal subsidies, Garcia was subject to the Hatch Act of 1939 banning those whose salary is paid primarily through federal funds from running in partisan elections. An appellate court overturned Bariso's decision and allowed Garcia back on the ballot. Garcia won the primary alongside Mukherji and won the November general election overwhelmingly. In the Assembly, he serves on the Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee, the Human Services Committee, and the Transportation and Independent Authorities Committee. He is not seeking a second term to the Assembly. On August 4, 2014, Garcia's contract at the Housing Authority was terminated during a meeting that featured numerous protests by residents and city council members. Claiming his firing was the result of a feud with mayor Dawn Zimmer, he began a campaign for the Hoboken City Council from the 6th Ward in August 2015 forgoing another term in the Assembly. He was defeated in the November 2015 non-partisan general election to the Zimmer-backed Jennifer Giattino. Garcia is married to Margarita and has three children. After his initial Assembly primary win in 2013, he and the others on the Democratic legislative ticket from his district endorsed Chris Christie in his successful bid for re-election to Governor of New Jersey."

He founded, and was a member of, several medical boards in Queensland, including a local branch of the Australian and New Zealand Association of Radiology. Uhr also entered the world of horse racing, and was chairman of a Queensland racing club. He also donated to colleges of the University of Queensland and stood in local elections.

According to the 1868 book Giants and Dwarfs, Chaffin (then age 42), \"has all the appearances of manhood, and he converses with vivacity and intelligence. His face is worn, sunken, and wrinkled, and its lower part is covered with tangled red ahir. His voice is of a childish treble, and particularly mournful. He is, however, cheerful and hopeful in disposition, and not in any way sensitive about his singular dwarfishness. Many years ago he was exhibited in all the cities of North and South America, and excited much interest and wonder; but since that period he has been living in obscurity in Bedford county.\" Chaffin did appear to make additional public appearances after this book was published. Chaffin's two brothers and parents were reported to be normal or greater than normal size. Chaffin died at his Virginia home in April 1873."

He was part of Taiwan's folk music scene and worked as an analphabetic creator of lyrics. His spontaneous performances of traditional tunes became an object of study for many scholars focused on the music of Taiwan and brought him to the attention of writers engaged in music criticism including the novelist Wang Tuoh. According to the Journal of Music in China, Chen Da was \"the only noted singer of Taiwanese folk singing.\" Chen Da is also referred to as a singer of “Hoklo folk songs,” a synonym of “Taiwanese folk songs.” Chiang Ching-kuo sought to visit Chen Da in his hometown, according to reports in the press. The high esteem that the singer has been accorded is also mirrored by the language used when referring to Chen Da: Music scholar Jen Shangren has praised the singer, claiming that “Chen Da is a rare folksong gem in the history of Taiwanese folk music…” Writing in the Taipei Times, the music critic Ho Yi has called Chen Da “the late folk legend” and “an exceptional yueqin musician famed for his Hengchun folk music sound (恆春調).” Helen Rees referred to Chen Da as the \"wandering bard\" in the “Introduction” to her book Lives in Chinese Music. Wang Ying-fen has called him “the best-known singer of the Hengchun Peninsula.” During the late 1970s, Chen Da became a voice of socio-cultural resistance against the Kuomintang (KMT) in the eyes of many supporters of the Tangwai movement, as the democracy movement was called. As a folk singer, he “has inspired a host of musicians ... in Taiwan.”"
