  "text" : "DeRose attended East High School in Pueblo, Colorado and played American football there. DeRose attended the University of Southern Colorado (USC), now known as the Colorado State University-Pueblo (CSU-Pueblo). He received a bachelor of science degree in business management in 1984 and received a Master of Business Administration in 1985. In the early 1980s DeRose served as a linebacker for USC. He also served as an athletic director for the university. By 1994 DeRose re-established the school's baseball program and had a new stadium complex built for baseball. Baseball had been previously ended in 1984 due to budget cuts. DeRose was also the owner, founder, and head coach of the Pueblo Crusaders, a Minor League Football System team. He served as the middle linebacker of the team. DeRose and Ed Watkins, who became the president of the league, met in late 1986, establishing the league. He also was the defensive captain of the 1987 New York Giants strike replacement team. He also tried out as a free agent for the Denver Broncos and has made attempts to re-establish the American football team of CSU-Pueblo. Under DD Marketing, DeRose negotiated exclusive soft drink contracts with U.S. school districts. DeRose's business model was against the previous system of soft drink manufacturers making low bids for exclusive soft drink contracts; school districts did not have the time or inclination to pursue alternatives to the low bids and had accepted the low bids. Under DeRose, school districts were able to get more lucrative contracts. In 1998 DeRose said that he negotiated such contracts for 63 school districts. DD Marketing marketed \"Zap Me,\" a program that places computers in schools. The computers installed by the program included advertisements seen in corners of the computer screens. DeRose expressed favor for placing advertisements in schools, saying that if there are no advertisements in schools, \"it doesn't give our young people an accurate picture of our society.\" DeRose argued that it was not his role to tell schools to accept advertising. Andrew Hagelshaw, the senior program director of the Center for Commercial Free Public Education, said that DeRose \"really illustrates the worst aspects of commercialism in schools\" and that he was \"making millions of dollars off commercializing public schools, and he is not taking into account any of the negatives.\" Constance L. Hays of The New York Times said that \"Several critics compare Mr. De Rose to the title character in The Music Man, the musical about a small town falling for a charlatan's pitch.\" Dan DeRose was one of the owners of Small Smiles Dental Centers. According to his brother, Michael DeRose, Dan DeRose provided some management and marketing services for the company. In 2006 the owners of Small Smiles, including Dan DeRose, sold the company. DD Marketing was not a part of the sale. In 2007 Dan DeRose announced that he was going to give a gift to CSU-Pueblo's American football team. It was the largest gift in the school's history. In 2007, at the Sangre de Cristo Arts and Conference Center, Dan DeRose received Charles W. Crew Business Leader of the Year award from the Pueblo Chamber of Commerce. In 2010 the Sons of Italy awarded DeRose, an Italian American, with the Golden Lion Award for his work with CSU-Pueblo and the Pueblo, Colorado community. In 2012 he was elected as the chairperson of the board of trustees of CSU-Pueblo."

  "text" : "Desy Lumini, best known as Daisy Lumini (18 August 1936 - 18 August 1993), was an Italian composer, singer and stage actress. Born in Florence, at young age Lumini graduated in piano and composition, and began her career as a composer of soundtracks and songs; she later came to fame by participating in numerous Italian television shows. Lumini, who spoke five languages fluently, during her career also toured in the United States (where she participated at The Perry Como Show and sang at Carnegie Hall), France and Germany. In the sixties, after a brief period in the cabaret, she devoted herself to the research and the diffusion of Tuscan folk music, recording many albums with the popular repertoire and put it on shows with the stage company of Beppe Chierici. After working in contemporary musical theater, in the eighties Lumini started a successful collaboration with Salvatore Sciarrino, winning the Prix Italia Award in 1985. In 1993, the day of her birthday, she killed herself with her husband Tino Schirinzi, struck by an incurable disease, by jumping from the viaduct under construction on the Bilancino dam near Barberino di Mugello."

During a return journey from Europe in 1932, Duncan met Hugh MacLennan on board the SS Pennland. They married in 1936 and settled in Montreal. Duncan wrote several semi-autographical works describing her encounters with Canadian culture before her health began to limit her activities in the late 1940s.

Because of this, after Li Cunxu's downfall and succession by his adoptive brother Li Siyuan, Li Siyuan's chief of staff An Chonghui came to suspect both Dong and Meng Zhixiang, the military governor of neighboring Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). Dong and Meng jointly rebelled against Li Siyuan and were successful military, forcing the imperial government to eventually move into a reconciliatory posture. Dong, however, as his son Dong Guangye (董光業) and Dong Guangye's family were slaughtered, refused the imperial overture, and later launched an attack on Meng, as Meng was moving to reconciliation with the imperial government. Meng defeated him, and he was later killed by his own subordinates."

  "text" : "Ding Yan (Chinese: 丁晏; Wade–Giles: Ting Yen; 1794–1875) was a Qing dynasty Chinese classical scholar. He achieved the rank of juren in the Imperial Examinations. Ding was born in Shanyang (present-day Huai'an), Jiangsu province. Although not awarded an official post, he was an important figure in the defense of Shanyang from the British in 1842, during the First Opium War. He also helped to rebuild the city's walls after the attack. As a result, he was appointed secretary of the Grand Secretariat in 1843. The following decade, Ding again organised a militia to defend the city from the Taipeng Rebellion. However, he was accused of incompetence, and was banished. This ruling was later overturned, and he was given responsibility for civilian military training, eventually reaching the second rank. His sons Shou-ch'ang and Shou-ch'i also served in public office. Despite his military accomplishments, Ding was best known as a scholar of the Classics. His Shang shu yu lun made the case for the forgery of the Shu ching, and he made many key arguments in favour of Wu Cheng'en being the original author of the Buddhist classic Journey to the West. He authored over fifty books on scholarly subjects, and was the director of two literary academies. Many of his works were compiled and published in 1862 as the Yi zhi zhai cong shu (Collected works of Yizhizhai Studio)."

He was a monk at the Hilandar Monastery and a contemporary of Saint Sava. In fact, he accompanied St. Sava when the latter visited the Holy Land. He was much respected by the royal court in Raška, as well as by the monks on the Holy Mount, better known as Mount Athos. Teodor's account of his troubles, recorded on the pages of John Exarch's Hexameron (Šestodnev), which Teodor was copying at Domentijan's request, contains many references concerning Domentijan and his character. It may be concluded that Domentijan was essentially a hymnologist who wrote biographies to two Serbian saints but, in fact, glorified monasticism and Christianity."

  "text" : "Jairo Mora Sandoval (March 22, 1987 – May 31, 2013) was a Costa Rican environmentalist who was murdered while attempting to protect leatherback turtle nests. Just before midnight on May 30, 2013, Mora and four female volunteers were abducted by a group of masked men. The women eventually escaped and informed the police. Mora's bound and beaten body was found on the beach the next morning. An autopsy determined he died by asphyxiation after suffering a blow to the head. Sea turtles are protected by law in Costa Rica, but poaching remains common. Locals take eggs, which are believed to be an aphrodisiac, and sell them on the black market. The egg trade has been linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. Environmentalists working in Limón say they are often threatened for trying to protect turtle eggs. Jairo Mora was one such environmentalist working in the area. In the wake of Mora's death, the organization he worked with cancelled beach patrol efforts in Costa Rica. His death attracted international attention, including a statement from the United Nations and multiple rewards for information on the case. In Costa Rica, his death led to calls for reform of environmental policy. On June 4, the government met with environmentalists to discuss potential changes to policy. A plan submitted by environmentalists and endorsed by Environment Minister René Castro would set up a new protected area and grant park rangers more authority to stop poachers, among other changes. On June 5, vigils were held across Costa Rica in honor of Mora. On June 18, the government announced the allocation of ₡20 million (US$40,000), which was later upped to ₡30 million (US$60,000), to memorialize Mora."

  "text" : "David Levi Strauss (born March 10, 1953 in Junction City, Kansas) is an internationally known poet, essayist, art and cultural critic, and educator from the United States. He is the author of a book of poetry, four books of essays, and numerous monographs and catalogues on artists. Since 2007, he has been Chair of the graduate program in Art Writing at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. He also taught at the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College from 2001-2005, and since 2002 he has continued to teach in the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard. Strauss’ principal subject in his books of essays has been the fertile and always changing relation between aesthetics and politics. He has been called “the undisputed champion of literary art writing,” and writer Luc Sante called him “photography’s troubled conscience.” Luc Sante, blurb on back cover of Between the Eyes (Aperture, 2003) Strauss’ critiques and theories about the role and influence of art and photography on society are frequently cited in the works of other contemporary writers and critics. In his introduction to Strauss’ book Between the Eyes, John Berger wrote, “Strauss, who is a poet and storyteller as well as being a renowned commentator on photography (I reject the designation critic) looks at images very hard . . . and comes face-to-face with the unexplained. Again and again. The unexplained that he encounters has only little to do with the mystery of art and everything to do with the mystery of countless lives being lived.” And Arthur Danto wrote, “David Levi Strauss is an art critic of exceptional originality and depth. I can think of none in this field I would rank ahead of him in terms of his knowledge, his seriousness, his adventure, and the power of his writing.” Strauss received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2003-04, and the Infinity Award for Writing from the International Center of Photography in 2007. The selection committee for the latter wrote, “His special perspective on ways of seeing has shaped our understanding of the changing nature of visual media.”"

The disease left him with a permanent physical disability and a speech impediment. He was placed in the care of his grandmother who became his source of strength and who taught him to do his best to be self-reliant as far as possible. Dwight Yearwood’s inspiring story has been captured in the book, Dwight Yearwood – Polio…He survived and conquered by Anton LaFond."

Specifically, Tryon specialised in the study of the languages of the Pacific Islands, particularly Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and the French-speaking Pacific. From 1970 to 1971, Tryon completed the first systematic study of the languages of Vanuatu, known at the time as the New Hebrides. His study, which collected a list of vocabulary words from communities throughout the islands, determined that there were more than one hundred distinct languages in Vanuatu. Tryon determined that the modern, indigenous languages of Vanuatu are part of Austronesian language family. Tryon began to study the languages of the Solomon Islands beginning in 1978. He was also authored works on the pidgin and creole languages of the Pacific Islands, including Pijin of the Solomon Islands and Bislama of Vanuatu."

  "text" : "David of Hungary (Hungarian: Dávid; between 1053 and 1055 – after 1094) was a member of the Árpád dynasty as the second son of Andrew I of Hungary and Anastasia of Kiev. David's exact birth date is unknown. His elder brother, Solomon was born in 1053 and the establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany (1055) clarifies that Andrew I has 'sons', thus David perhaps was born between the two dates. During the civil war between his father and Prince Béla, Queen Anastasia took refuge with her two sons to Austria, where they resided until 1063, when Béla I died in accident. David did not participate in the battle for the throne, involving his brother and his cousins, Géza and Ladislaus, and did not deal with the politics. According to historian Mór Wertner, David was a member of the clerical order in 1094. In the same year he donated a large sum of money to the Abbey of Tihany, which founded by his father, Andrew I in 1055. Probably he died shortly, as the tone of the charter of donation was formulated as a testament. In 1095, when King Ladislaus I died, according to the contemporary records, only princes Lampert, Coloman and Álmos survived the king. David was buried in Tihany, next to his father."

In the early 2000s, he moved to London, England, where he got a job at Gordon Ramsay's Claridge's, later moving to other Ramsay restaurants in London, Tokyo and New York City. He later became executive chef at Daniel Boulud's Lumière restaurant in Vancouver, following the departure of Rob Feenie from the establishment in 2007, until its closure in 2011. He opened his own pair of restaurants, ensemble and ensembleTap, in 2011. He won the Top Chef Canada title soon afterward, investing his prize money in the venues, but closed them in 2012 after determining that rental costs in downtown Vancouver were too expensive for them to become profitable. In early 2013, MacKay announced that he was returning to his hometown of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan to open a new restaurant. The restaurant, named Ayden Kitchen & Bar, opened on November 15, 2013. He made a return appearance on Top Chef Canada in 2013, acting as sous chef to third season finalist Danny Francis."

  "text" : "Dawn Averitt (born 1968) is an American HIV/AIDS treatment policy advocate and activist. Averitt was diagnosed with HIV in 1988 at the age of 19, most likely acquired as a result of a rape she experienced living and modeling in Spain. She began her career working in the office of Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia from 1990 to 1993. Averitt started working for the AIDS Survival Project in 1993. She was an early advocate for women with HIV and for reducing stigma associated with the disease in order to improve access to care. In 1995, Averitt launched the Women’s Information Service and Exchange (WISE) the first US-based organization to focus on HIV/AIDS treatment information and advocacy for women. In 2000, Averitt completed a hike of the entire length of the Appalachian Trail called “Trekking with AIDS” to raise awareness about HIV and the reality that it can affect anyone, and to celebrate 12 years of successfully living with HIV. In 2001, Averitt decided to have children and in 2002 authored an article called \"HIV and Pregnancy: Tough Choices and the Right to Choose\" about her choice. In 2002 and 2004, Averitt delivered two healthy HIV negative children. In 2002, she and her brother Richard co-founded The Well Project, a nonprofit organization that \"works to improve the lives of women living with HIV and AIDS, and to change the course of the AIDS pandemic by focusing on treatment and prevention for women.\" Much of Averitt's work has focused on including women and people of color in research on HIV/AIDS and on advancements in HIV treatment and care. She founded a think tank in 2003 that became the Women's Research Initiative on HIV/AIDS (WRI). In 2003 she also received a Mothers and Shakers award from Redbook Magazine. From 2006 to 2009 Averitt was a driving force behind the GRACE Study, the first HIV treatment study in the US to successfully enroll a majority of women. The GRACE Study helped show that HIV positive women and people of color will participate in clinical studies and that they experience different barriers to treatment than men. In July 2007, Averitt received a Women Leading Global Change Award from the World YWCA for her leadership in the HIV and AIDS pandemic. In 2010, Averitt was named to the Presidential Advisory Committee on HIV/AIDS (PACHA). In 2012, she organized the first National HIV Awareness Month in the US to raise awareness of the ongoing epidemic in the US. To date, more than 63,000 people have signed a petition on the organization’s website committing to help end AIDS in the US. Dawn Averitt was born in Georgia in 1968 and now lives in Vermont with her daughters."

The trip took 38 days. He flew a Jabiru J230 with adaptations that he designed to enable him to fly. The purpose of the flight was to spread the message of the charity founded by Jacka, On a Wing and a Chair. The charity's mission was to raise the publics' expectations of what people with disabilities can achieve and inspire everyone, with or without a disability, to get out and have a go at their own dreams and goals. In 1988, as a 19-year-old, Jacka had a motorbike accident which resulted in C5/C6 quadriplegia. He was left with 6% physical function. He has no movement below his armpits, limited arm function, no finger function, and cannot regulate his body temperature. Jacka is a former Paralympian, representing Australia as part of the Australia national wheelchair rugby team at the 1996 Summer Paralympics. In 2006, Jacka became the world's first quadriplegic to fly a powered hang glider (ultralight trike). In order to fly the aircraft, Jacka designed the adaptations needed to suit his disability. Jacka was also a founding member of the Physically Challenged Shooters Club, based in Springvale, Victoria."

  "text" : "Richard E. \"Dick\" Longshore (born March 21, 1926 in Arkansas City, Kansas - died June 8, 1988 in Sacramento, California) was an American Navy veteran of WWII and both Korean and Vietnam Wars. He was also a California politician and a member of the Republican Party. He first ran for the California State Assembly in 1982 against Democratic incumbent Richard H. Robinson, who had held the Orange County-based 72nd district since 1974. Although Longshore managed just 43.8% of the vote, he didn't give up. He ran against Robinson again in 1984 and this time, with Ronald Reagan at the top of the ticket, scored 49.8% of the vote. From 1984 to 1986 he served as a member of the State Veterans' Board. By the time Longshore ran again in 1986, Robinson had decided to make what would turn out to be an unsuccessful run for Congress against then Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Santa Ana). In the race for Robinson's now open assembly seat Longshore defeated the Democratic candidate, then Santa Ana mayor Daniel E. Griset by just over 10 points. In 1988, one day after winning the Republican primary for reelection, Longshore died from complications of pneumonia. This allowed the Orange County Republican Central Committee to name a replacement candidate, and they chose 29-year old Curt Pringle, an elected member of the committee. Pringle went on to narrowly win the seat against Democrat Christian Thierbach, a deputy district attorney from Riverside county."

In 2013, he was a member of a team of scientists that discovered and characterized the extrasolar planet Kepler-64b, a.k.a. PH1, the first planet discovered in a quadruple star system. He showed that suspected transits in the Kepler Space Telescope data of the system were indeed due to a planet transiting the eclipsing binary in the system. In 2014, he helped discover and characterize planets in three additional stellar systems, including Kepler-88 and Kepler-247. Asteroid (79912) Terrell is named in his honor."

  "text" : "Damien Mander (born 11 December 1979 in Mornington, Australia) is a former Australian Royal Navy Clearance Diver and Special Operations military sniper turned anti-poaching crusader. An environmental and animal welfare activist, Mander is outspoken about the priorities of mankind in an increasingly challenged society. He frequently advocates the use of military equipment and tactics for the purpose of protecting animals, including the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Mander used his life savings and liquidated his investments and assets to fund the start-up and running costs of the International Anti-Poaching Foundation – an organisation dedicated to the protection and preservation of wildlife in some of the world's most volatile regions. Mander’s personal evolution has seen him recognise the need for protection of all animals, not just from an ethical standpoint, but also from a global environmental perspective. A public speaker, Mander is a vegan who actively encourages his audience to hold back the tide of human encroachment and correct the imbalance between dwindling wilderness areas and rapidly increasing human populations. Mander is also a director of the Conservation Guardians. He resides in Southern Africa with his wife Maria."

  "text" : "Walter Cole (born 1930), better known as Darcelle XV, is a drag queen in Portland, Oregon, United States. Cole was raised in the Linnton neighborhood and served in the military until the late 1950s, after which he lived a \"conventional\" life in southeast Portland with his wife and two children. Funds he received from the military helped Cole start new business ventures. He first purchased a coffeehouse near Portland State University called Caffé Espresso, which later relocated and was expanded to include a jazz club called Studio A. In 1967, Cole purchased a tavern in northwest Portland called Demas, which became Darcelle XV Showplace. Cole first wore a woman's dress at age 37. By 1969, he had developed the \"alter ego\" Darcelle and came out as gay. He left his wife and began a relationship with Roxy Neuhardt. During the 1970s, the Showplace became a popular destination for drag performance. In 1999, Darcelle became the oldest female impersonator on the West Coast after the closing of San Francisco's drag venue Finocchio's. In 2010, Darcelle served as grand marshal of the Portland Rose Festival's Starlight Parade and received the city's Spirit of Portland Award. That same year, Cole and Sharon Knorr published his memoir, Just Call Me Darcelle; Knorr also served as director of Cole's 2010 one-person show of the same name."

  "text" : "Tito Claudio Traversa (April 22, 2001 – July 5, 2013) was an Italian climber who died of complications from a climbing accident in which he fell from a 50 feet (15 m) groundfall on July 5, 2013 at the age of 12. An investigation by French officials revealed that his quickdraws were assembled incorrectly, with the carabiners threaded only though the rubber keeper, and not through the full-strength sewn loop at the ends of the quickdraws that are designed to support the climber's weight. According to public prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello, eight out of ten of Traversa’s quickdraws were assembled this way. Five people have been charged with manslaughter in the case. Among those charged is the owner of the company that produced the rubber keepers without instructions, as well as the owner of the gear shop that sold the keepers. The manager of the club that organized the climbing trip, as well as two of the instructors who were at the climbing site, have also been charged for failing to check the safety of the equipment."

  "text" : "Derek Ronald Sherborn (7 May 1924- 4 July 2004) was a conservationist and Principal Investigator of historic buildings for the Ministry of Town and Country Planning, who played a major role in the rescue of historical properties, making a pioneering contribution to the preservation of England's architectural heritage. The only child of Ronald Thorne Sherborn, a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, amateur photographer and draughtsman, and his wife Evelyn May (née Allman), Sherborn was born and raised in Streatham, a descendant of the Sherborn family of Bedfont, Lords of the Manors of Fawns and Cockbell, first recorded in the person of John Sherborn, of Feltham, who appeared in the Middlesex Muster Rolls for Foot Soldiers in 1338 as being required to serve with a bow and arrow. The family had been settled at Bedfont since the 14th century. In his youth, Sherborn was a collector of coins, stamps and Roman pottery, and his enthusiasm for history led him to attend auctions. After Streatham Grammar School, Sherborn joined the R.A.F.  Upon his discharge in 1944, Sherborn's interest in architecture led him to survey all the old buildings of Reading. This study qualified him, in 1948, for a position with the newly formed Ministry of Town and County Planning, as an investigator of historic buildings. The work, poorly paid and solitary, was nonetheless his true vocation given his great passion for conservation; given the damage and neglect of wartime and heavy cost in death duties, many formerly great estates were imperiled. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Although numerous houses of distinction were lost, Sherborn's diligence and effort led to successful rescues of houses such as Calke Abbey, Derbyshire, Lydiard House, at Lydiard Tregoze, Wiltshire, and Cowick Hall in Yorkshire. His 1951 list of 2,000 outstanding country houses for the Gower Report led to the creation, in 1953, of the Historic Buildings Council for England, Wales and Scotland. By 1978, Sherborn was the Ministry's Principal Inspector, on the Listing Committee, Ecclesiastical Buildings Committee and the Outstanding Buildings Committee of the Historic Buildings Council. He retired in 1982. Fawns Manor in Bedfont, in the ownership of the Sherborns since the 15th century, was inherited by Sherborn's uncle, the taxonomist Charles Davies Sherborn on the death of his kinsman William Sherborn in 1912. When Charles Davies Sherborn died in 1942, the Manor came to Ronald Thorne Sherborn; the family took up residence in the restored house in 1950. Sherborn lived there after his father's death until 1983, when, following several burglaries, he sold the manor to the British Airways Housing Association and moved to a seafront villa in Brighton. He died in 2004, having published his memoirs, 'An Inspector Recalls', the previous year."

Its through the attitude and the way art is created which decide the spiritual energy and power in the artistic expression. He oppose to the modern view of art that the concept and the ideas in art is the most important and central. He means that the concept and the ideas emerge from the way the art is done.

In 1917, while on his way to China and Japan with a friend, Austen \"Billy\" Parker, to study traditional Asian theater, he became stranded in Panama, unable to find passage on any of the ships transiting the Panama Canal because of shipping diversions due to demands of the First World War, he and Parker decided to head for France to join the war effort. On March 28, 1917, Tucker joined the French Foreign Legion, but only a few weeks later in April he transferred to the Lafayette Flying Corps. From May 22m, 1917 to January 26, 1918, he was in training at the aviation schools of Avord, Pau, and Le Plessis-Belleville, being breveted pilote (Caudron) and promoted to corporal on September 30, 1917, and attaining a record as a skillful and courageous pilot. On January 28, 1918 he was sent to the front, assigned first to Escadrille Spad 74, transferring later to Spad 15 in the Groupe de Combat 13. In June he was promoted to sergeant. On July 8 he was part of a routine patrol of five Spads when they encountered 15 German Fokkers in the Soissons and Chateau-Thierry area. The other four returned to base but Tucker was reported missing. He was found with the wreckage of his plane in a field along the Longpont-Chaudun road or on a battlefield at Vierzy - the German records are incomplete. He died of his wounds and after the war his body was identified and buried in an American war cemetery at Seringes-et-Nesle."

  "text" : "Dr David James Masterton Mackenzie, CMG, OBE (Traditional Chinese: 麥敬時醫生, 23 July 1905 – 10 March 1994) was a British colonial medical official. From January 1958 to September 1963, he was Director of Medical and Health Services of Hong Kong, being the last non-Chinese person to hold that post, and an official member of the Legislative Council. Born in New Zealand, Mackenzie spent his childhood in the United Kingdom and graduated from the medical school of the University of Edinburgh in 1929. He moved to South Africa in 1932 and joined the Colonial Medical Service in 1934. He was Director of Medical Services of Bechuanaland from 1946 to 1949, of Nyasaland from 1949 to 1955, and of Northern Nigeria from 1955 to 1957. Having served in the medical departments of a number of British colonies and protectorates in Africa for some 23 years, he had become an expert of tropical diseases and infectious diseases in that region. As Director of Medical and Health Services of Hong Kong, preventing and controlling infectious diseases had become his prime objective. When the territory was twice hit by cholera outbreaks between August and October 1961 and 1962, he adopted a number of effective emergency measures to combat the disease, such as to set up a temporary cholera hospital and a quarantine station-cum-isolation camp, and more importantly, set up a large number of vaccination points in the territory to urge the public to receive free vaccinations. Besides, to satisfy the ever-growing demand, he rapidly expanded the public health system by constructing a number of large-scale hospitals and public health facilities including the North Wing of Kwong Wah Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital. In retirement, he served in the Communicable Disease Center in Georgia, the United States, and the medical school of the University of Cape Town, South Africa. He resided in Cape Town in later years and died there."

  "text" : "Dennis Comeau (born 1965, New Haven, CT) is a shoe designer and former new wave vocalist and guitarist. Musically he is best remembered for his short-lived band Hormones with Stiv Bators and Andre Siva, his band Flustercunk, and collaborations with members of Pere Ubu, and DNA. Flustercunk notoriously opened for Blondie at CBGB in 1982, and were kicked out and asked not to return after a fight broke out in the crowd and Comeau was hit in the face with a bottle and hospitalized. The band was accused of \"inciting a riot\", though band members refuted the accusation. After leaving the music industry, Comeau became an assistant to shoe designer Enzo Angiolini, now owned by Jones New York. Moving to Florence, Italy in the mid-1980s, Comeau launched both a couture line of ladies shoes, and followed up a few years later with a bridge line under the Comeaution label. In 2001 Comeau acquired the then-defunct Bernardo Sandals label along with his business partner Roy Smith of Houston, TX. A higher-priced line under the label \"Bernardo Vintage Couture\" was launched worldwide in 2011, consisting mostly of re-issued sandals designed by Bernard Rudofsky and Eva Sonino. Bernardo was sold in 2011, and Comeau and wife Lynne resigned from their design position with the brand in March 2013. The Herbert Levine line was also briefly designed and owned by Comeau. Comeau and wife Lynne relocated to Tesuque, NM, in 2006, where they jointly own and operate a shoe design studio along with the studio in Florence, Italy"

  "text" : "Dominique Davalos is American rock singer and bass player formerly in the band Dominatrix who's controversial music video single \"The Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight\", released in 1984 was deemed too racy for its time. The track became a pioneering force in the freestyle genre, and was noted for its use of spoken lyrics. The song's video, directed by Beth B., featured a fur and stocking-clad Dominique, and it was the imagery in the video set against the subject matter of the song that prevented it from becoming a mainstream success. Commercial radio stations banned the single, and MTV refused to air the risque video. In 2012, the video was placed on display in the contemporary art wing of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.[1] Dominique worked with former Go-Go Kathy Valentine under the name The Delphines, they released two albums, The Delphines (1996) and Cosmic Speed (2001). Dominique and Kathy's current band The BlueBonnets have released 2 albums to date, Boom Boom Boom Boom (2010) and Play Loud (2014). They are currently working on a new BlueBonnets album and touring. Dominique is also currently writing, singing and playing bass for her other Austin Texas born band SuperEtte who just completed recording their second EP. The first EP Yours Til The End was released in 2014. As an actress, she best known for such films as Salvation!, A Woman Under the Influence, Howard the Duck and Stump the Band. As a bass player she has played bass for; The Keenen Ivory Wayans Show, Tito & Tarantula, Gods Hotel Featuring Spike From From The Quireboys."

Lean was born in Melbourne, and educated at Melbourne Grammar School. He was the managing director of Stadiums Limited, his family's business, prior to entering politics. He was a councillor of the City of Chelsea from 1990 to 1994, and served as mayor in 1994. Lean was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1996 state election, defeating Labor MP and former Kirner government minister Mal Sandon. Lean's victory in the formerly safe Labor seat fell against the tide of the 1996 election, the only seat gained by the Liberal government at an election at which they had a net loss of three seats to the Labor opposition. Lean was defeated by Labor candidate Jenny Lindell amidst the Liberal loss at the 1999 election."

She was later suspended by the Uttar Pradesh government for allegedly demolishing an illegal mosque wall in a village in Greater Noida, which resulted in severe opposition as it was perceived to be based on flimsy grounds. There was a growing demand from various political parties, associations of Indian bureaucrats, and by the general public on online social media for her suspension to be revoked. Her suspension was revoked by the Uttar Pradesh government on 22 September 2013. Nagpal was appointed OSD (Officer on Special Duty) in the Agriculture Ministry in January 2015, a post that she currently holds."

  "text" : "David Gelbaum (born in c. 1950) is an American businessman and primarily green technology investor and environmental philanthropist. Since 2002, he has invested up to $500 million in clean-tech companies through his Quercus Trust, with a portfolio of businesses involved in nearly every aspect of the emerging green economy, be it renewable energy, smart electric grids, sustainable agriculture, electric cars or biological remediation of oil spills. He is CEO and Chairman of the Board of Entech Solar, a company he co-founded with Mark O'Neill. Gelbaum studied at University of California, Berkeley and Humboldt State College in Northern California before graduating with a B.A. in mathematics from University of California, Irvine. After graduating, he worked for a math professor, Edward O. Thorp, whose theories led to the establishment of what became Princeton Newport Partners, one of the first investment firms to use mathematical formulas to price stocks and derivatives. Princeton/Newport Partners collapsed in 1989, following the indictment of five executives in connection with a scheme to create illegal tax losses. Mr. Thorp and Mr. Gelbaum were not implicated, and an appellate court later overturned the other executives’ convictions. From 1972 to 1989, Gelbaum worked at the financial firm Oakley & Sutton performing quantitative modeling for stock price returns and derivative securities. He moved to TGS Management with a similar capacity until 2002. His investment focus is on the environmental technology and renewable energy industries having served on various public company boards in these industries, including the boards of Solar Enertech Corp., ThermoEnergy Corporation, Clean Power Technologies, Inc. and Energy Focus, Inc."

  "text" : "David Amodio is an American scientist who examines the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying social behavior, with a focus on self-regulation and intergroup relations. Amodio is known for his role in developing the field of social neuroscience and for his neuroscientific approach to social psychology. Amodio’s research considers the roles of social cognition, emotion, and motivation, and their neural underpinnings, as they relate to implicit processes and mechanisms of control in social behaviors, and his research has revealed that social motivations and attitudes can shape the earliest stages of face processing in vision. In a complementary line of work, Amodio investigates the effects of discrimination on health and decision making among targets of prejudice, with the broad goal of understanding and reducing health disparities. Amodio is also the author of an influential review of the brain’s role in social cognition, and he has received attention for his study showing that political liberals and conservatives differ in patterns of brain activity associated with cognitive control—an early example of research in the field of political neuroscience. Although his questions often address classic social psychological issues, Amodio’s approach is interdisciplinary; he integrates theory and methodology from social psychology, cognitive and affective neuroscience, and psychophysiology to inform his hypotheses and the designs of his studies. Amodio directs the New York University Social Neuroscience Laboratory and the NYU Social Neuroscience Network, and he serves as Associate Editor for the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. He was also a co-founder of the Social and Affective Neuroscience Society and served on the founding advisory board for the Society for Social Neuroscience. Amodio has been recognized for his research contributions with awards such as the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) from the White House, the Janet T. Spence Award for Transformative Early Career Contributions from the Association for Psychological Science, the F. J. McGuigan Early Career Investigator Prize from the American Psychological Foundation, the Early Career Award for Contribution to Social Cognition from the International Social Cognition Network, and the SAGE Young Scholars Award from the Foundation for Personality and Social Psychology."

  "text" : "David G. Grier is an American physicist whose research focuses on experimental soft condensed matter physics—an interdisciplinary field that includes physics, chemistry, biology, and nanotechnology, aiming to understand how objects interacting in simple ways manage to organize into sophisticated hierarchies of structure and function. Grier is a professor in Department of Physics at New York University and a founding member of NYU’s Center for Soft Matter Research. Named as one of the “Top 20 Scientists Under 40” by Discover magazine in 2003, Grier served as chair of the university’s Department of Physics from 2005 until 2013. Soft-matter research features close ties to industry, both because many of the most interesting soft-matter systems have immediate economic value and also because research in this field involves developing new methods and instruments for processing nanoscopic and microscopic systems. Among these is a holographic optical trapping technique, developed by Grier’s group as part of its National Science Foundation-funded basic research program, which provides the groundwork for new categories of applications in photonics, medical diagnostics, drug discovery, and environmental monitoring. The company he founded to commercialize this technology, Arryx, Inc., was recognized with an R&D 100 Award during its first year of operation. Grier’s achievements in this field have led to his being named one of the Scientific American 50 for 2004 and one of the World Economic Forum’s Technology Pioneers for 2005. His laboratory’s other achievements include developing state-of-the-art methods of digital video microscopy and introducing powerful new methods of holographic video microscopy. Using these techniques, the Grier group has demonstrated the first practical tractor beams, the first knotted force fields, and the first optically organized micromachines. The partnership of optical micromanipulation and optical characterization has revealed new principles in non-equilibrium statistical physics and is responsible for the still-controversial discovery that like-charged objects sometimes can attract each other. Grier has published over 100 peer-reviewed articles on basic research in this area and holds more than 50 U.S. Patents on technology invented in the course of this research. His efforts have been recognized with a David and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship. More than a dozen of his former graduate students and postdoctoral fellows have gone on to faculty positions in major universities or leadership roles in industrial research and development. Raised in New York City and a graduate of Stuyvesant High School, Grier attended Harvard College, where he graduated with high honors in physics. He received his doctorate in physics from the University of Michigan in 1989. After two years as a postdoctoral fellow in the Condensed Matter Physics Department at AT&T Bell Laboratories, he accepted a faculty position at the University of Chicago, where he was a member of the Physics Department for 12 years."

  "text" : "Daniel Blain, M.D. (1898–1981) was an American physician and was the first Medical Director of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the first professional medical society founded in the United States in 1844. He may be credited with the leadership which brought changes in the practice of psychiatry after World War II and in advocating the treatment for people with mental disorders. Blain was born in China to missionary parents. His mother tutored him at home until he was 11 years old and was sent to boarding school in Shanghai. At age 13, he came to the United States to continue his education and worked through high school and college. He obtained his undergraduate degree from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. He left the university after his second year to teach at Hangchow College in China. He attended the University of Chicago for pre-medicine studies then entered the medical school at Vanderbilt University. He received his M.D. in 1929. He interned at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and then trained at the Boston City Hospital. His residency in psychiatry was completed at the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In 1941, he opened his private psychiatric practice in New York City. In 1972, he was awarded an LLD degree by La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and an honorary Sc.D. from Washington and Lee University. With the start of World War II, Blain was commissioned into the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), and was the medical director for the War Shipping Administration (WSA). Through the WSA, Blain directed the provision of medical care for casualties in the Merchant Marine Service. When the war ended, he was recommended to lead the Psychiatric and Neurologic Division in the Department of Medicine and Surgery in the Veterans Administration (VA) to provide care for World War II veterans. Blain was instrumental in providing psychiatric and neurologic care to thousands of veterans who were rehabilitating in inadequate VA hospital facilities and VA outpatient clinics which had inadequate numbers of trained medical staff. Blain forged relationships between the newly organized National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) of the USPHS, and with medical schools and universities. The new relationships between the VA hospitals and clinics established training programs in psychiatry, neurology, psychology, social work, and psychiatric nursing which led to the infusion of trained professional medical staff. Blain reorganized the Psychiatric and Neurologic Division’s central office by adding trained staff who were responsible for the patients. Blain was in the VA post for two years (1946-1948) when the American Psychiatric Association (APA) reorganized, and established the position of Medical Director. The APA offered the position to Blain. He accepted and was the Medical Director for ten years. He also served as the chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Georgetown University Hospital from 1947-1948. One of Blain’s first undertakings was moving the APA’s main office from New York City to Washington, DC, and to adequately staff the office. Since most psychiatrists were stationed in state mental hospitals and a small number of private mental hospitals, Blain began to visit the state hospitals to establish channels of communication with the APA membership. He began a four-page newsletter. He was appalled at the inhumane conditions he found at some state hospitals, which led to calling a meeting of hospital superintendents to exchange information and suggest improvements in patient care. Thus, the first Mental Hospital Institute was organized in 1949 and continues to meet annually. The Mental Hospital Institute Proceedings were published and led to the journal Mental Hospitals. After ten years as the APA Medical Director, Blain resigned in the 1950s. He spent a year as the director of Mental Health and Research and Training of the Interstate Commission of Higher Education. He then moved to California to serve as the Commissioner of Mental Health from 1959 to 1963. He retired to the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital, a private mental hospital in Philadelphia where he served as director of the community psychiatric program. He was named Emeritus Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. He also worked with the United Auto Workers to help organize the financing of mental health programs for the unionized auto workers. From 1966 to 1970, Blain was the superintendent of Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry which had a long history of custodial care. Blain was involved in numerous professional activities. He was a consultant to the Alaska Health Department, which was establishing the state’s first mental hospital. Blain reportedly visited over 500 mental hospitals during his career. In 1975, the Salmon Committee of the New York Academy of Medicine awarded him its Distinguished Service Medal. He served as Chairman of the Psychiatry Department at Georgetown Medical School from 1946 to 1948. Blain was a member of numerous professional organizations including the APA (president, 1964-1965), the American College of Psychiatrists, the American Psychoanalytic Association, the American Association of Mental Deficiency, the Canadian Psychiatric Association, the Australian College of Psychiatrists, and the Royal College of Psychiatry. He died in Philadelphia in 1981."

Police initially treated the case as one of a missing person, although their enquiries revealed she had probably been a victim of sexual abuse near the location where she was last seen. She is now believed to have been murdered. A jury failed to reach a verdict in the trials of two men, one accused of murdering Downes and the other of disposing of her body. A re-trial ended with not guilty verdicts when the prosecution withdrew the charges. There have been no convictions in relation to the disappearance of Downes."

His legislative service coincided exactly with the administration of Winthrop Rockefeller, Arkansas' first GOP governor since Reconstruction. Like Rockefeller, Patrick was unseated in his bid for a third term in the general election held on November 3, 1970. The Democrats, led by gubernatorial nominee and later U.S. Senator, Dale Bumpers wiped out the gains that Republicans had temporarily achieved during the Rockefeller years."

  "text" : "Diana Lui (born May 7, 1968 in Malaysia) is a Franco-Belgian artist, photographer and filmmaker of Chinese origin. Diana Lui is best known for her large format photographic portraits of today's growing hybrid generation of multicultural and multiethnic individuals. Diana Lui was born in Malaysia and has been based in Paris for more than 10 years. She graduated from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California in 1992. A master with the 8×10 inch view camera, Diana Lui develops long term photographic and artistic projects over several years. Intimate Portraits, what Lui calls \"intimate/psychological/anthropological portraits on today’s hybrid generation of new nomads who have lost their roots and origins due to the onslaught of globalism\" was initiated 20 years ago and continues to develop to this day. Lui’s silent portraits show the existential urgency of each individual’s existence through the space or objects surrounding him/her, the intrinsic gestures and physical positioning of the individual within his/her environment. With this constantly evolving series, she has won several awards including France’s 20th Bourse du Talent (Young Talent Award for Photography) and the Prix Kodak de la Critique Photographique (Kodak Critics’ Award), Belgium’s Prix National de la Photographie Ouverte du Musée de la Photographie à Charleroi and was in 2008 a finalist for the Prix de la Fondation HSBC pour la Photographie."

  "text" : "Dominic J. Monetta, (born 1942) served as the Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering (Research and Advanced Technology) from 1991 to 1993, acting as the de facto Chief Technology Officer for the United States Department of Defense. He had previously held the position of Director, Office of New Production Reactors, at the United States Department of Energy from 1989-1991, in addition to serving as the Technical Director and the Senior Executive at the Naval Ordnance Station, Indian Head, Maryland from 1986-1989.Dr. Monetta serves as the science and technology member of the Board of Hudson Technologies, Inc, The Center for Security Policy, The PAM Institute and the Nevada Test Site Historical Foundation. Throughout his career, he has been an early proponent advocating for development of alternative mobility fuels.Dr. Monetta worked extensively in operations pioneering new energy technology. He was responsible for designing and building the new U.S. Tritium Production Rectors, which would have been the only and largest nuclear reactors to be built in the United States in the past three decades and the single largest construction project in the federal government at the time.An article in the Journal of Business and Behaviorial Sciences credits Dr. Monetta with instituting a management style that “helped create a positive, competitive environment for sponsoring and encouraging innovation” to “jump-start tritium production while securing the future of American reactor design.” Dr. Monetta’s experience in the nuclear field was also applied to the Natural Gas industry, as his management concepts were instituted at the [Gas Research Institute] (GRI). A 1993 article shows that using this methodology, the GRI’s Research and Development arm saw a “success rate of at least twice the [industry] norms” which allowed “increased gas availability at lower prices.” The R&D undertaken by GRI “led the way to a family of high-efficiency furnaces” as well as innovations in “development of technology to allow recovery of unconventional gas.” Dr. Monetta’s demonstrated commitment to innovation and development of alternative fuels has continued into the realm of hydrogen technology. In 2004, he delivered a presentation at the SMART TechTrends Conference where he summarized the US approach to Hydrogen technology and urged swift action: “The problem for the U.S. is that waiting 25 years is not an option because the United States consumes more energy than any other country in the world…“Hydrogen represents an instant opportunity for capital expansion, growth, wealth accumulation and individual energy independence, security and prosperity.” He recommended several policy changes to help grow the Hydrogen industry, suggesting that legislators: “Provide short term items in the Department of Energy budget against a mid and long term R&D program plan. R&D is a critical element in the progression to the next level economy. The promise of the Hydrogen future rests in the ability of creative inventors to finagle meager dollars for advanced concepts, materials, storage and fuel.” He championed an initiative to “change out the entire U.S. government fleet” from fossil fuel to hydrogen vehicles.He encouraged promoting “the “personal perk” exemption from HOV restrictions for Hydrogen fuel vehicles”, which the Commonwealth of Virginia did in 2006, and again by extending the law in 2011.Lastly, Dr. Monetta implored legislators to establish “a 50% tax credit for anything Hydrogen (production, storage, transportation, consumption), allowing Hydrogen to be special and competitive with gasoline.” Dr. Monetta received a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Manhattan College, a M.S. in Engineering Administration (Operations research) from the George Washington University, and a Doctorate in Public Administration (R&D Management) from the University of Southern California."

He received his law degree from Howard University in 1871. He later moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he became the first black lawyer to appear before the Michigan Supreme Court. In 1890, Straker argued that the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" was unconstitutional according to Michigan law. Straker was one of the 56 prominent Detroit residents invited to contribute a letter to the Detroit Century Box, a time capsule organized by then-mayor William C. Maybury and sealed on December 31, 1900.  It was opened on December 31, 2000. The most thorough study of Straker is a 1974 dissertation: Dorothy Drinkard Hawkshawe, “David Augustus Straker, Black Lawyer and Reconstruction Politician, 1842-1908\" (PhD Diss., Catholic University of American, 1974)."

  "text" : "Richard J. \"Dick\" Casull (/kə'sul/) was a Utah-born gunsmith and wildcat cartridge developer whose experiments with .45 Colt ammunition in the 1950s led to the creation of the .454 Casull cartridge. Casull’s passion were six-shooters, and he was determined to create a high velocity round for the .45 Colt. His goal was to achieve a muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per second with Colt .45 rounds fired from a single-action Army-style revolver with a 7 ½ inch barrel. This proved impossible due to the tensile strength of the Colt .45 cylinder, so he set out to develop his own casing and bullet. Casull began his career as a wildcat cartridge developer after having contact with Elmer Keith in the 1940s, an Idaho rancher, firearms enthusiast, and author. Keith was instrumental in the development of the first magnum revolver cartridge, the .357 Magnum, as well as the later .44 Magnum and .41 Magnum cartridges. Keith was instrumental in the development of various wildcat cartridges, a few of which were later adopted as factory rounds. Casull also worked with Oregon-based gunsmith P.O. Ackley, the famous wildcat cartridge developer. Ackley developed a family of improved wildcat cartridges by rechambering extant firearms and fireforming the ammunition to decrease body taper and increase shoulder angle, resulting in a higher case capacity. Ackley improved not only standard cartridges but was the creator of the first .17 caliber (4.5 mm) centerfire cartridge. He developed the .450 Ackley Magnum (based on .375 H&H Magnum necked up to .458) and the .475 Ackley Magnum (based on a .375 H&H Magnum necked up to .475 (12 mm))."

Before retiring from teaching, Baldwin had previously worked as a lecturer at both the University of Leicester and the University of Nottingham. In 1986, over 25 years before the 2012 excavation and the discovery of the king's body, he predicted that Richard III's remains would be found at Greyfriars, Leicester. In his 2010 book, Robin Hood: The English Outlaw Unmasked, Baldwin argued that the 'real' Robin Hood was Roger Godberd, a disinherited supporter of Simon de Montfort. He drew attention to the many similarities between Godberd's career and the stories told of Robin in the earliest ballads, and to a grave slab in Loxley churchyard in Warwickshire which appeared to be identical to one associated with Robin in earlier centuries. In his 2007 book, The Lost Prince: The Survival of Richard of York, Baldwin discussed the possibility that the younger of the Princes in the Tower, Prince Richard, survived, and was the \"Richard Plantagenet\" who died in December 1550 at Eastwell in Kent. Richard had worked as a bricklayer at St. John's Abbey, Colchester, until 1539, but, unusually for someone of his class, could read Latin. He is sometimes said to have been an illegitimate son of King Richard III. Baldwin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 2012. A religious man, Baldwin was a member of a Christadelphian congregation in Leicester."

He has edited John Milton's Paradise Lost (Barnes and Noble 2004) and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (Barnes and Noble 2005). In 2002 a lengthy correspondence in The Nation followed Hawkes' critical review essay on Stephen J. Gould's final book. In 2012 a special issue of the journal Early Modern Culture was devoted to a discussion of his anti-materialist literary theory. In 2013 his 20,000 word article on Recent Studies in the English Renaissance for the journal Studies in English Literature angered critics with remarks on the contemporary economy that many found irrelevant to the topic. Hawkes' work generally explores the connections between economics, literature and philosophy, showing a strong anti-capitalist bias."

  "text" : "Denzil Dean Harber (1909-1966) was an early British Trotskyist leader and later in his life a prominent British ornithologist. Denzil Dean Harber was born at 25 Fairmile Avenue, Streatham on 25 January 1909. His father was a ship's carpenter turned architect, his mother the daughter of a successful south London butcher. During the First World War the family moved to Sussex , where they lived in a succession of houses at Climping, Lewes, and Eastbourne and finally at the Black Mill, Ore near Hastings. From a very early age he developed an interest in many aspects of natural history including reptiles, butterflies and moths, fossils and birds. Suffering from chronic asthma from infancy his formal education was spasmodic. He was however taught how to learn, and how to plan courses of study himself by an inspiring private tutor. Developing what became a lifelong interest in languages he taught himself French and German. It is not clear how he became interested in politics, but by the end of 1926 he was reading various anti-imperialist pamphlets published by the Labour Research Department. By March 1927 he had read the first volume of Capital. According to John McIlroy (see references) he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1929. It was undoubtedly this political interest that led him to start to teach himself Russian and then to study Russian commerce at the London School of Economics (LSE). In the summer of 1932, he travelled to the Soviet Union as an interpreter for a Canadian journalist with the intention of settling there but was disillusioned by what he found. Returning home, he found copies of the Bulletin of the Opposition published in Russian by the Trotskyist Left Opposition in Henderson's bookshop in the Charing Cross Road. Harber expected that the journalist who employed him would publish a full account of their visit to Russia and felt because he went as her employee it would not be right for him to publish his own, but in fact the journalist never did. However Harber did write a short report entitled Seeing Soviet Russia for the Lent Term 1933 issue of the student journal of the LSE Clare Market Review which included how he had witnessed famine in the Russian countryside and the ruin of Soviet agriculture. This is one of the very few contemporary accounts of Russian conditions written by an outside visitor fluent in Russian. In 1932 Harber joined the Communist League, the successor of the Balham Group an opposition group in the CPGB and the first independent Trotskyist group in the country. Trotsky advised the group to enter the Independent Labour Party (ILP), which had just disaffiliated from the Labour Party. Trotsky believed that the group should work for a \"Bolshevik transformation of the party\". The majority of the Communist League argued against joining the ILP in favour of maintaining an open party, but allowed thirty of its members led by Harber to form a secretive \"Bolshevik-Leninist Fraction\" in the ILP. This difference in orientation essentially split the party, and in November 1934, sixty Trotskyist ILPers officially formed the Marxist Group, led by Harber. While, perhaps due to this delay and infighting, the group never achieved the influence hoped for by Trotsky, it did win new members, including C. L. R. James. Ted Grant also joined the organisation, having moved from South Africa. By the ILP Conference of 1935, it claimed a similar strength to the Revolutionary Policy Committee, which was sympathetic to the Communist Party of Great Britain. However Harber now left the ILP to join the Labour Party, as Trotsky urged, now forming the Militant Group. Harber later led this into the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL) of which he was a secretary for a time. In 1944 the RSL fused with the rival Workers International League to form the Revolutionary Communist Party (1944-1949]. Harber was one of the British delegates to the founding conference of the Fourth International in Paris on September 3, 1938 and together with C. L. R. James was elected to represent Britain on the International Executive Committee. Later than month he married Mary Whittaker who he had first met in the Labour League of Youth. The following year he moved with her back to Sussex - to Eastbourne - where he became a Co-operative Society insurance agent, a job he held for the rest of his life. By 1937 he had revived his interest in natural history and in particular in ornithology. In Sussex he started to contribute to the South-Eastern Bird Report. That for 1939 records his sighting of a Snow-Bunting at Birling Gap near Eastbourne on September 24 of that year. For the next ten years he combined political activity with ornithology. Harber had long opposed Gerry Healy, but when the Revolutionary Communist Party dissolved in 1949, he did briefly follow many of his comrades into Healy's group, The Club. However, after publishing one article in the Club's journal, Marxist Review, he abandoned active politics (though not his political beliefs) in favour of ornithology. In 1948 the Sussex section of the South Eastern Bird Report became an independent publication The Sussex Bird Report under the editorship of Grahame des Forges. In 1949 Harber became the report’s co-editor and from 1956 its sole editor, a position he held until 1962 when he relinquished control to the newly formed Sussex Ornithological Society. In 1963 his and des Forges’s A Guide to the Birds of Sussex was published. Very early in his ornithological career Harber had come to the conclusion that a series of rare and exotic birds allegedly shot in an area around Hastings between 1903 and 1916 (the so-called Hastings rarities) were forgeries and the manuscript to the Guide to the Birds of Sussex rejected them. By the time the Guide was published a full exposure of the forgery had been published in British Birds (magazine) (1962 vol 55 8 283-349). Harber’s reputation as an ornithologist increased over the years. In 1955 in an extended review of The Birds of the Soviet Union for British Birds he brought together his knowledge of Russian and ornithology. In 1959 he was invited to join the British Birds Rarities Committee  – the official adjudicator of rare bird records in Britain – and in 1963 he became its Honorary Secretary. He died on 31 August 1966"

Assisted by Disney's top animators, Graham helped to document and establish many of the principles that make up the foundation of the art of traditional animation. he posthumously received the Winsor McCay Award for lifetime achievement in the animation field from ASIFA-Hollywood in 1982. Don Graham really knew what he was teaching, and he \"showed\" you how to do something – he didn't just talk. He taught us things that were very important for animation. How to simplify our drawings – how to cut out all the unnecessary hen scratching amateurs have a habit of using. He showed us how to make a drawing look solid. He taught us about tension points – like a bent knee, and how the pant leg comes down from that knee and how important the wrinkles from it are to describe form. I learned a hell of a lot from him!— Art Babbitt, Once Upon a Time — Walt Disney: The Sources of inspiration for the Disney Studios"

  "text" : "Don Crosby, OAM (29 October 1924 – 3 December 1985), born George Wallace Donald Crosby, the fifth child of actor Joseph Alexander (Marshall) Crosby and Theresa King. He was named after his father's friend, the actor and comedian George Wallace Stevenson. At the age of one, he was taken on stage by his father in a production of the operetta His Royal Highness. At age 12, he started producing radio sketches at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC, then known as the Australian Broadcasting Commission). After leaving school, he continued acting and worked in insurance. After World War II broke out, he served as an air gunner in the Royal Australian Air Force. In 1945, aged 21, he travelled to London and worked as an assistant stage manager in the West End, when he was offered a scholarship to study at the Royal Academy, after which he worked throughout England in repertory. In 1949 he returned to Sydney and married Elizabeth Teresa Glover. He appeared in Doris Fitton's production of Dark of Night, and numerous other productions in Sydney and Melbourne. Entering radio in 1949, he had a successful career not only as an actor but also as a producer. When television arrived in Australia in 1956, he easily made the transition to the new medium, featuring in plays, again at the ABC, after which he moved to commercial television, appearing in serials made by Crawford Productions, such as Ryan, Division 4, Matlock Police and Homicide. In 1968, he played the role of Mervyn in Tony Hancock's doomed Australian series, which was shelved upon Hancock's suicide and later released as a TV movie in 1972. With his craggy features, Crosby was often compared to British superstar Sir John Mills. In radio, another popular role was in the long-running Gwen Meredith drama serial Blue Hills. More stage roles followed and he was celebrated for his appearances in works by Steele Rudd. In film, his credits include Newsfront, Little Boy Lost, The Picture Show Man and the indigenous rights film The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith. His later television work included roles in The Young Doctors and A Country Practice. He was one of Australia's most distinguished actors and radio producers, with a career spanning all genres including stage, film, radio and television. He urged the use of Australian actors where possible and spoke out against cuts in ABC funding. In 1980, he was awarded an OAM, and in 1985 he received the Australian Film Institute's Longford Lyell Award for services to the industry. He was a trade unionist and was president of Actors Equity of Australia from 1976 until his death from a myocardial infarction in 1985 in the Sydney suburb of Potts Point. He was survived by his wife, threes sons and a daughter. He was 61."

  "text" : "David Schubert (1913–1946) was an American poet. An excellent student, he had been accepted to Amherst at the age of 16. The poet Robert Frost was one of his professors there and showed him kindness, but in part due to mental instability the college asked him to leave. Though diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia he had poems published in prestigious poetry magazines during the Depression. David Schubert died of tuberculosis at the age of 33. During a breakdown Schubert destroyed a large portion of his work, but after his death his ex-wife spent years piecing his poems together. She then found him a publisher who put out Initial A in 1961. More recently an expanded edition of his work has been released as Works and Days. William Carlos Williams said of David Schubert: \"To sit down for a little while and reread some of Schubert’s rare and poignant verse is like opening a window in a room that had become stuffy without one’s realizing it.\" John Ashbery dedicated a chapter of Other Traditions to Schubert, in which he relates coming to the same conclusion: \"I myself value Schubert more than Pound or Eliot, and it's a relief to have an authority of the stature of Williams to back me up.\""

  "text" : "Dennis Nikrasch (September 12, 1941 – 2010) was a Vegas slot cheater and a former locksmith who was responsible for spearheading the biggest casino theft in Las Vegas history, by grabbing $16,000,000 from rigging slot machines over a 22-year period. His career began in Chicago, Illinois as a locksmith. He then found out that he could break into any lock he wished, due to his extensive knowledge of the tools, and became associated with members from a key Chicago crime family until his arrest in 1961. When he was released in 1970, he realized that he could make even bigger profits by manipulating slot machines in Las Vegas. From 1976 until 1983, he obtained $10 million from this method. He was then found in 1986 and sentenced to five years in prison. He was released in 1991, but didn't return to Vegas headlines until 1996, when he returned, this time with a new approach in response to the higher levels of security. He actually managed to keep his cheating secret until November 1998, when one of his accomplices revealed information about his cheating machines. He was arrested and sentenced to 7.5 years in prison, being released in 2004. He died in 2010 from unknown causes."

Together with hieromonk of his church, bishop Michail and Metropolitan Pimen he traveled to Constantinople and its region in 1389. Ignjatije wrote the earliest record about the Battle of Kosovo, only 12 days after the battle. He recorded that a man who loyally served Prince Lazar (Serbian: у цара српскога Лазара неки верни слуга) was slandered as traitor. With intention to prove his loyalty during the battle this man pretended that he deserted Lazar's troops, went to the sultan Murad I and killed him. The name of this man is added (Miloš) to some later transcripts of Ignjatije's original text although it was not presented in the original manuscript."

He earned his doctorate at the University of San Fernando, later serving as secretary of the Colegio de Abogados in Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1845–47). In 1850 he emigated to Puerto Rico, where he maintained a successful law practice. Here he befriended Leopold Krug, a German consul stationed in Mayagüez, who like Bello y Espinosa, was an amateur botanist. With Krug, he collected flora native to the island, and in the meantime, took copious notes of the various plants. In 1880 he returned to La Laguna and published the two volume \"Apuntes Para la Flora de Puerto Rico\" (1881, 1883), an annotated checklist of 964 species that was based on his Puerto Rican collections. In this work, however, he failed to make any mention of Krug's significant contributions to the project. Bello y Espinosa's original plant collections from Puerto Rico were eventually destroyed by insects. In 1880 Bello y Espinosa published a book of prose, titled \"Un Jardín Canario\". The standard author abbreviation Bello is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Downer Tenney Bramble (born Hartland, Vermont, February 28, 1832; died October 9, 1887, Watertown, South Dakota) was an American pioneer businessman and politician in Dakota Territory. Bramble was born into a Vermont farming family in Hartland on February 28, 1832. At the age of 17 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee to work in a drug store owned by his older brothers Gilman and George; later he and Gilman opened a branch store in Memphis. In 1857 he moved to Ponca, Nebraska, where he briefly operated a grocery, and served in the 5th Nebraska Territorial Legislature. He married a woman named Lucinda Brown, but she died 6 months later, and Bramble loaded up a wagon full of goods and moved to the frontier at Yankton. While visiting Connecticut in February 1861, Bramble married Martha Perry; she died 16 months later in Yankton, followed a few months later by their infant daughter, Carrie. In January 1866 he remarried, this time to Virginia Van Der Hule, with whom he had two children, Harry Jesse and Frank Litchfield Bramble (1871-1966). At Yankton, Bramble established a general store, bringing goods by ox cart from Sioux City. This became the firm of Bramble, Miner and Co. Bramble operated freight lines and ferries, owned the largest warehouse in Yankton, helped start the bank and build the railroad. A branch store at Fort Pierre was washed away in the Great Flood of 1881, which caused such extensive damage to Bramble's enterprises that he was forced to close his store in 1882. In 1884 he was appointed receiver at the government land office in Watertown, South Dakota and moved his family there. Bramble also served four terms in the Dakota Territory's territorial legislature, 3 terms (1861, 1862, 1873) on the Council and once (1866) in the House. Bramble died of cancer in Watertown, South Dakota on October 9, 1887. He was buried at Yankton City Cemetery in Yankton."

  "text" : "David Leon Chandler (May 26, 1937 - January 23, 1994) was an American journalist who wrote several historical and biographical books during the 1970s and 1980s. He was associated with early coverage of the Kennedy Assassination and was mentioned in the Warren Commission report. Chandler was born in Covington, Kentucky.Following service in the merchant marine and U.S. Navy, Chandler worked three years from 1959 for The News-Herald in Panama City, Florida. Eventually he led a team whose investigation and coverage of corruption won the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, citing the newspaper's \"three-year campaign against entrenched power and corruption, with resultant reforms in Panama City and Bay County.\" He worked for New Orleans' afternoon newspaper The States-Item 1962–1964 and then on contract with Life magazine, initially regarding the Kennedy assassination. Chandler ran for Governor of Louisiana in the 1971 Democratic Party primary \"hoping to prove that a candidate could win the governorship without taking any campaign contributions\"—and finished twelfth with 0.62% of the vote. From 1972 he was a free-lance writer of magazine articles and books. Chandler's books include Brothers in Blood (1975), a history of the Cosa Nostra; The Natural Superiority of Southern Politicians, (1977); 100 Tons of Gold about a mysterious gold horde in New Mexico; Henry Flagler: The Astonishing Life and Times of the Visionary Robber Baron Who Founded Florida (1986); The Binghams of Louisville (1988), a controversial biography of Robert Worth Bingham (who married Flagler's widow a year before her death); and The Jefferson Conspiracies (1994), about the death of Meriwether Lewis (released several months after Chandler's death). He also ghost-wrote the autobiography of his friend, Lafayette Lawyer J. Minos Simon. Chandler lived in New Orleans during the late 1960s and 1970s where he resided in an apartment in a building owned by Clay Shaw. He died in Denver at age 56. He was survived by his third wife Mary Voelz Chandler and by four children from previous marriages."

He was a member of the royal Mukhrani branch of the Bagrationi dynasty, born as a younger son of Levan of Kartli (Shah-Quli Khan) and his first wife Tuta Gurieli. Domentius was energetically involved in the politics of Kartli and, according to some contemporary accounts, he even had regal ambitions. The split in his patriarchal tenure was due to his opposition to the accession of the Ottoman regime in Kartli and he spent thirteen years in the Ottoman captivity from 1725 to 1737. A man of letters, Domentius compiled a collection of Georgian hagiography. He also sponsored reconstruction and repair of several churches and monasteries in Georgia. His regnal name is sometimes given as Domentius III."

As a literary critic and biographer Stouck has explored the importance of landscape in the arts: Willa Cather’s great plains, Sinclair Ross’s Saskatchewan prairie, Ethel Wilson’s British Columbia. In his biography of Arthur Erickson he focuses on the architect’s integration of buildings with their settings: Simon Fraser University terracing a coastal mountaintop, the University of Lethbridge outlining a prairie coulee, Vancouver’s Museum of Anthropology celebrating a shoreline, and domestic homes shoring up hillsides and defining forests. As an editor and historian he has been concerned to rescue fragile documents, especially letters, and to make them part of the public record."

  "text" : "Donald J.P. Ziraldo is a Canadian winemaker and businessman, and a recipient of the Order of Canada. He has often been hailed as one of the most important figures in Canadian Wine History. He has been credited with starting the first winery in Canada since Prohibition. He and his partner/winemaker, Karl Kaiser, were the founders of Inniskillin Winery in Niagara, Canada. In the spring of 1974 Ziraldo was determined to start a winery after he and Karl Kaiser, an Austrian-born wine-maker who had immigrated to Canada a few years earlier, found the wines in Ontario to be \"undrinkable\". Ziraldo got the OK to obtain a winery license from Major-General George Kitching, who was the chairman of the Liquor Licensing Board of Ontario. Along with Kaiser, they worked together for 30 years to establish Inniskillin and put Canadian wines, which were at the time, virtually unknown, on the world wine map. Their most well known accomplishment was winning the coveted the Grand Prix d'Honneur at Vinexpo, France in 1989 for the Inniskillin Vidal icewine. Ziraldo would be the man to create an internationally recognized Canadian wine category with icewine. Today, Canada is one of the world's largest producers of icewine and sells a significant quantity to the Asian markets, largely due to the efforts of Ziraldo's vigilant marketing prowess over the past 30 years."

Representing Tibet at national Chinese music competitions in 1988 and 1990, she won a silver medal each time. She made five albums in Tibet. Her music, which is characterized by a mixture of traditional and popular folklore, was also critical of the situation in her country, which is considered by the Chinese authorities as a threat to the state. Inspired by the Taiwanese singer Teresa Teng, Dadon also incorporated some styles of Tibetan rock band Rangzen Shonu after hearing a tape smuggled into Lhasa in 1988. In 1992, she decided to flee and was granted political asylum in the United States (Middletown, Connecticut). Her defection was cited in an internal speech by the Secretary of the CPC Tibet Committee Chen Kuiyuan in 1997, as well as the TV journalist Ngawang Choephel and director of the Tibet Hotel in Lhasa Jamyang Choegyal, son of Minister Kashopa Chogyal Nyima, two other government employees. In 1997, with her 3 years old son Tenzin Tashi, she participated in a march for Tibet led from Toronto to New York, by Thupten Jigme Norbu, and the Tibetan Freedom Concert in New York."

  "text" : "Daniel Nearing (born December 21, 1961) is a Chicago, Illinois-based director, screenwriter, and independent filmmaker.Hogtown, his 2015 \"period-less\" American film, has been called \"the most original film made in Chicago about Chicago to date.\" His earlier breakthrough film, the micro-budget production Chicago Heights (2010) garnered rave reviews, especially among fans of the original source material, Sherwood Anderson’s influential collection of short stories, Winesburg, Ohio, a book long thought impossible to be adapted as a film. Noted film critic Roger Ebert included Chicago Heights in his list of the Top Art Films of 2010. Nearing’s storytelling style tends to be more circular than linear. He views plot as a veneer that ties together the more important, character-centered aspects of any story. Nearing is known for building sequences of vignettes and using powerful imagery to focus on the isolation and humility of human life. He works primarily in black and white, with moments of what he refers to as \"ecstatic color\" and with heavily shadowed, \"idiosyncratic\" shot compositions. Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune says that \"Nearing's chosen way of telling a story is poetic, elliptical and sometimes unhelpfully indirect... with a true artist's eye.\" Nearing is also a professor at Governors State University in University Park, Illinois, where he is a three-time winner of faculty excellence awards and founded the MFA in Independent Film and Digital Imaging program."

  "text" : "David Howard (born David Charles Edwards) (14 June 1937 – 11 August 2013) was an English ballet dancer and teacher, who taught internationally at institutions such as the Royal Ballet, the American Ballet Theatre, San Francisco Ballet, Joffrey Ballet, and the National Ballet of Canada. Howard opened his popular eponymous dance studio in New York City, the David Howard School of Ballet (later the David Howard Dance Center) in 1977, before its closure in 1995. His dance center welcomed all students including children, adult beginners and professionals from the Broadway musicals and ballet. In addition to his teaching, Howard was an expert on the history of the pointe shoe worn by ballet dancers, and a pioneer in their design. As a boy, Howard studied dance and won the Royal Academy of Dance's Adeline Genée Silver Medal aged 16. When he registered with the British performing artists' union, Equity, he found that a David Edwards was already a member, and so he had to call himself David Howard. Howard later became a dancer in the London Palladium chorus, appearing in shows featuring Julie Andrews, Marlene Dietrich and Danny Kaye. Howard was a soloist at the Sadler’s Wells Theater Ballet, the forerunner of the Birmingham Royal Ballet. From the Royal Ballet he briefly joined the National Ballet of Canada, and returned to london in the early 1960s. Howard performed in musicals in London before a back injury ended his performing career, and began to train as a hairdresser, which further hurt his back. Howard continued to teach dance and in 1966 Howard was contacted by the oil heiress Rebekah Harkness, who was looking for teachers for her ballet school, the Harkness Ballet in New York City. Howard left to teach in her school in Manhattan, where he lived for the rest of his life. Of his move to the United States Howard said that he \"...came as an upstart and ended up a part of the American dream.” Howard later taught at two dance schools in Manhattan, Steps on Broadway and the Broadway Dance Center. He also taught internationally and created 125 instructional dance CDs and DVDs. His teaching style was described by The New York Times as \"...a kinaesthetic approach, in which dancers were taught to rely less on external feedback from the mirror and more on the minute internal signals that telegraph the position of the head, limbs and torso in space\". Howard said of dance that “Out of the feeling comes the form...Ninety percent of the time students are taught the form first. And then they’re expected, through some act of God, to get the feeling.” Howard's pupils included Gelsey Kirkland, Patricia McBride and Mikhail Baryshnikov. McBride paid tribute to Howard describing him as \"...one of the great teachers of our day, for many, many years,” and Baryshnikov said of Howard that \"He was a kind of father figure for people like me and like Gelsey.”"

  "text" : "Donald Elliott Hines (born November 14, 1933) is a family physician in Bunkie in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, who was from 1993 to 2008 a member of the Louisiana State Senate for District 28. In his last term from 2004 to 2008, he was the Senate President under his political ally, Democratic former Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco. Hines completed his undergraduate studies from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and obtained his M.D. from the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans. He served in the United States Navy from 1959 to 1963 and began his medical practice in 1966. He is a member of the Louisiana and the Avoyelles Parish medical societies. Hines was a member of the Avoyelles Parish School Board from 1972 until his election to the state Senate. Hines won a special election in January 16, 1993, to succeed Senator John Saunders, who resigned after seventeen years in the office. In addition to his own Avoyelles Parish, District 28 included in 1993 all or parts of the following: Allen, Calcasieu, Evangeline, Jeff Davis, and St. Landry parishes. Hines polled 15,314 votes (58 percent) to 11,094 (42 percent) for his intraparty opponent, I. Jackson Burson, Jr, a lawyer from Eunice. Hines was elected to his first full term in 1995 with opposition from one other Democrat. From 1996 to 2000, a portion of Avoyelles Parish was also represented in the state Senate by a second physician and a former professional football player, Republican Tommy Casanova of Crowley in Acadia Parish. Hines won his third and fourth terms without opposition in 1999 and 2003. In 2006, HInes was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. In its announcement of his induction, the Hall of Fame called his a \"country doctor ... who became one of the Senate’s most articulate spokesmen for the needs of the working class and poor people.\" Hines chaired the task force that created the Louisiana Children’s Health Insurance Program. He also authored the Rural Hospital Preservation Act and the SeniorRX Prescription Program. He helped to establish the Gene Therapy Research Initiative. Term-limited in the Senate, Hines was succeeded by his fellow Democrat Eric LaFleur of Ville Platte in Evangeline Parish. LaFleur won the Senate seat on November 17, 2007, when he defeated in a runoff contest, Donald Newton of Bunkie, a grandson of Donald Hines. District 28, which has been frequently altered in redistricting, now includes Avoyelles and Evangeline parishes and portions of Acadia, Allen, and St. Landry parishes."

  "text" : "As director of the Pixar Photoscience Team at Pixar Animation Studios, DiFrancesco and his team were responsible for the task of accurately transferring high resolution digital images to film. In this role, he developed the world's first laser scanning and recording devices for 35mm motion picture film  and established reliable, commercially successful methods for this process, called PixarVision. This pioneering work earned him two Scientific and Engineering Technical Academy Awards and 16 patents. In 1996 the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers adopted his recommended practices for governing output of digital images to film. Before that DiFrancesco worked at Computer Image Corp., working on Scanimate with Lee Harrison, and also at Xerox PARC with Dick Shoup working on the first 8-bit shift register framebuffer technology, and at JPL with Jim Blinn working on Carl Sagan's Cosmos Series. His prototype film recorder resides in the permanent apparatus collection of the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film. His recent research included the development of a prototype interchangeable light field lens for motion picture cameras that enables post-production re-focusing of motion picture images and the capturing of 3D motion pictures with a single lens and camera. In 2004, DiFrancesco designed a custom LED-based strobiscopic lighting system to sync the animation of physical Pixar Toy Story characters in the Pixar Zoetrope, first shown at the Museum of Modern Art in collaboration with [Pixar’s 20th Anniversary exhibit]. The original Pixar Zoetrope has travelled the world to various museums and several other zoetropes are on display at Disneyland’s California Adventure theme park in Southern California and other Disney theme parks. DiFrancesco’s technical knowledge with zoetropes was put into use on a two-minute film entitled “Forza/Filmspeed,” directed by Jeff Zwart. The film revealed the world’s fastest Zoetrope in the form of a high resolution still images taken from the Xbox game Forza Motorsport 5. Stills from the game were printed onto panels and staged at key intervals around a Barber Motorsports Park race track to recreate the illusion of movement known as the persistence of vision. As a photographer, DiFrancesco’s work has been displayed at the MoMa in New York City, the Yale University Library collection, V&A CG collection London, England and in a number of private collections. He holds a BFA from the University of Wisconsin-Superior, attended the Danish Film Institute and the MFA program at the University of Colorado. In 2000, he was awarded an honorary PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Superior."

Watterston was born in Balgone Barns, Haddingtonshire, Scotland, youngest son of James Watterston and his wife Catherine née Broadwood.The family, after spending a year in Gottland, in the Baltic Sea, went to Australia, arriving in April 1853. After acting as clerk in an attorney's office in Melbourne, Watterston moved to Queensland in May 1860, and in October of the same year, commenced his connection with the press. He learned reporting on the Ipswich Herald (afterwards the Queensland Times) under and then moved to Brisbane in 1865, to undertake parliamentary reporting. Watterston spent several years in the gallery for The Brisbane Courier and next on the Guardian, from which paper, in June 1869, he obtained promotion to the parliamentary staff of The Argus, Melbourne, returning to Victoria after nine years' absence. Watterston executed various special commissions for The Argus, being sent to the United States in 1876, for six months, in connection with the Philadelphia Exhibition. He went to England in 1879, to report on the movements of the Berry-Pearson embassy. Watterston was appointed chief of The Argus reporting staff in 1881, and four years later, on the editorship of the Australasian becoming vacant, he had that position given to him, the Australasian being a weekly literary, sporting and agricultural journal, started by the proprietors of The Argus in 1864. Watterston was editor of the Argus from 1903 to 1906. Watterston died in Armadale, Victoria, Australia on 23 July 1931; he was unmarried."

In 1802, during the Haitian Revolution, Dermide arrived on the island-colony of Saint-Domingue with his parents, as part of the Saint-Domingue expedition. After his father's death of yellow fever later during the year, Dermide and Pauline were brought back to France. In 1803, Pauline remarried, this time to Italian nobleman Camillo Borghese, and she took up residence, along with her husband and son, in Rome. Always a frail child, Dermide died of a fever at the age of six, three months after his uncle became Emperor and two years before his mother's proclamation as Duchess of Guastalla."

  "text" : "Joseph Daniel Hollingsworth, Jr., known as Dan Hollingsworth (born May 14, 1934) is a businessman who was the mayor of Ruston in Lincoln Parish from 1999 until 2015. He is a political Independent. In 1994, Hollingsworth ran for mayor but was defeated in the general election by the Democratic incumbent Mayor Hilda Taylor Perritt, a former high school teacher, who received 3,182 votes (54.9 percent) to Hollingsworth's 2,616 (45.1 percent). Perritt was first elected in 1990, when she unseated the Republican Mayor Elton C. Pody (1938-2011), who subsequently moved to Alexandria, Louisiana, where he became director of the Central Louisiana Chamber of Commerce. Four years after his loss, Hollingsworth on October 3, 1998, handily unseated Perritt, who finished third in the nonpartisan blanket primary. Perritt failed in a comeback bid in 2002, when Hollingsworth received 3,143 votes (63.2 percent) to her 1,834 (36.9 percent). In his most recent election in 2010, Hollingsworth with 64.4 percent defeated two other Independents to gain his fourth term in the office. In 2008, Hollingsworth launched \"Ruston 21\", a planning process to address municipal needs well into the 21st century. From Ruston 21 came plans for capital improvements, economic development, and zoning and land-use improvements. Hollingsworth claimed that the program was designed to \"preserve what is best about Ruston [but] cut down on wasted time and effort and avoid duplication of services. The result will be cost savings [with] investment in improvements for the future ...\" Hollingsworth owns KRUS AM radio in Ruston, 1490 on the dial. He is married to Beverly Faye Hollingsworth (born 1937). Hollingsworth was succeeded as mayor by the Republican Ronny Lynn Walker (born c. 1951), who in the November 4, 2014 primary, held in conjunction with the general elections in the other forty-nine states, defeated fellow Republican \"Bill\" Elmore, 3,197 (59.9 percent) to 2,144 (40.1 percent)."

  "text" : "David Allen \"Dave\" Fredrickson (August 11, 1927 – August 28, 2012) was an American archaeologist, anthropologist, and folk singer. He was born in Berkeley, California, and moved with his family to Redwood City in 1932, spending much of his childhood with his mother's farming family in the San Joaquin Valley. He enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1944, and returned there after a period in the U.S. Navy at the end of World War II. He started graduate studies in archaeology at Berkeley, but left in 1952 and took various jobs including driving cabs and trucks, gardening work, and giving guitar lessons. He married in 1954. A lover of old-time and cowboy songs, and influenced by Woody Guthrie and Burl Ives, he stated that \"I do not consider myself to be a folk-singer; more I am a singer of old-time songs.\" He recorded an album, Songs of the West, for Folkways Records in 1961. The album was described by the Journal of American Folklore as \"a masterpiece of straightforward western style singing.\" He returned to archaeology in 1960 and began working on excavations across California. He completed his M.A. degree at University of California, Davis in 1966, and gained a Ph.D. in 1973. In 1967 he was appointed to the Anthropology Department at Sonoma State College, where he rose to become Professor in 1976. He developed the work of the archaeology program particularly through cooperation, mutual respect, and beneficial relationships between the indigenous peoples of California and archaeologists. He retired in 1992, and the Anthropological Collections Facility at Sonoma State University was named in his honor in 2004. Throughout his career he continued his active involvement in music groups in and around Berkeley, organising the Crabgrass group and releasing a CD, Four Cords, in 2005. He died in 2012 at the age of 85."

Dlamini settled his followers near the Pongola River where it cuts through the Lubombo Mountain range. The early Swazi journeyed along with the Ndwandwe who are a closely related lineage. Dlamini was succeeded by Ngwane III his son with Queen LaYaka Ndwandwe. Dlamini's son Ngwane III, took over the chieftaincy and established Swazi settlements south of the Phongola river and when forced to abandon them, he moved his followers to cross back and settle on its northern banks. This marks the founding of modern Swaziland, and the first capital at Zombodze was established not very long after his ascent. Ngwane's brothers Ndlela and his uncle Shabalala were settled nearby."

  "text" : "Daniel Mahgerefteh (died 2012) was an Iranian Jewish man who was murdered in suspicious circumstances after he was dating the daughter of a member of Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). He was the son of a well-known businessman and one of the wealthiest Jewish families in Tehran. The Jewish community believed that he was murdered due to the relationship, but Iranian authorities said that the murder was about robbery. The murder happened in December 2012 when \"Mohammad D.\" who was a friend of the victim, shot him from close distance with a pistol. The murderer then stole two candle holders, one carpet,one electric guitar, one laptop and a BMW which was worth around 300 million tomans (about $100,000). The murderer said that the reason behind the killing was class differences and the fact that Daniel was belittling him for being poor.However according to Armin Avi Kreuznacher, an Iranian-born Jew who emigrated from the country in 2010, Mahgerefteh was killed by the woman’s family after the two had intimate relations and he refused to marry her. “The murder was carried out as revenge for dishonoring the family,” said Kreuznacher, who currently resides in Germany.Menashe Amir, an expert on Iran’s Jewish community, told The Times of Israel that the official account of Mahgerefteh’s murder was rife with inconsistencies."

  "text" : "David Carmichael was a Scottish railway engineer, born in Dundee c. 1818. He died in Dundee on 5 April 1895, aged 77. As a mechanical engineer, he was co-founder of James Carmichael & Co (later renamed Ward Foundry), builders of one of the first railway locomotives in Scotland in 1833. This engine - the Earl of Airlie - was an 0-2-4 for the Dundee and Newtyle Railway and the first British locomotive to have a bogie (a wheeled wagon or truck attached to the railway engine). Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 0-2-4 represents the wheel arrangement of no leading wheels, two powered driving wheels on one axle, and four trailing wheels on two axles. This is a most unusual wheel arrangement, with the only known examples being three locomotives, all supplied to the Dundee and Newtyle Railway by J. Carmichael in 1833. Carmichael was the third son of Charles Carmichael, who developed and introduced a valve gear modification of a single fixed eccentric (the valve gear of a steam engine is the mechanism that operates the inlet and exhaust valves to admit steam into the cylinder at the correct point in the cycle) in 1818. He was apprenticed at his father's works before moving to Bristol as a draughtsman, and later to the dockyard at Woolwich. He returned to Dundee in 1849 to join his cousin George Carmichael at Ward Foundry. The Foundry closed in 1929. The Railwayman's Club at Guthrie Street, Dundee, is on the site of the former Ward Foundry offices and is now a listed building."

  "text" : "Donald Larnach (17 July 1817 – 12 May 1896) was a banker, financier and High Sheriff of Sussex in 1882. Larnach was the son of the late William Larnach, of Newton, Caithness, Scotland, and was born in the year in which the Bank of New South Wales was founded (1817). At the age of seventeen he emigrated to Sydney, New South Wales, where he engaged with great success in squatting and mercantile pursuits. In 1845 he married Jane Elizabeth, daughter of William Walker, a prominent Sydney merchant. In the following year he became a director of the Bank of New South Wales, and was chosen president in 1852. On the discovery of gold in Australia in 1851, Larnach, in conjunction with his colleagues, entered largely into the purchase of the precious metal on account of the Bank, and in 1852 doubled the capital out of profits. In the latter year he returned to England and became manager of the London branch, in the founding of which he was the active spirit. Larnach retained his connection with the management of the Bank of New South Wales for twenty-five years, and on his retirement was elected Chairman of the London Board of the Bank. In 1858 he became a director of the London Joint Stock Bank, and is also on the board of the Indemnity Mutual Marine Insurance Company. Whilst the Bank of New South Wales held the agency of that colony, its monetary affairs were conducted with great success by Larnach, who is regarded as one of the leading financial authorities in the city of London."
