He was a colleague of Dario Guidotti in early education; by age 16, he was apprenticed to the studio of the architect Giovan Battista Silvestri and then with Enrico Presenti. He worked on projects to decorate the stations of the railroad route of Montevarchi-Arezzo and the mines of Tana. Afterward he worked with engineer Del Noce, who was transforming the Palazzo Paggeschi, the Hôtel della Pace in Piazza Manin (now Piazza Ognissanti). He also worked on the refurbishing of the inn, now Albergo Montebello. He became a volunteer in the first Italian war of independence, but had to withdraw when he became ill. He returned to Florence, where he worked until 1854 to care for those afflicted during a cholera epidemic. Working independently, he designed what is now the Palazzo Levi for the Baron of Vaguonville at Piazza Vittorio Veneto. He also designed the stables for the banchiere Du Fresne in the fondaci di Santo Spirito and the Palazzo of Ernesto Levi in Piazza Indipendenza, as well as other buildings for the Levi family. He designed the Palazzo Sariette in via Calzaioli. Later in life, he was knighted by the Kingdom of Italy."

Eisendrath Prize for \"Nude\" in 1938 and, in 1940, the William M.R. French Memorial Gold Medal from the Art Institute Alumni Association for his painting \"Mother and Child.\" As a participant in the government's Alaskan project, he painted pictures of that state to promote protection of the wilderness. One of those, \"Mt. Kimball,\" hangs in the Anchorage Museum at Rasmuson Center. While Johnson painted in both water colors and oils, he is best known for his murals, which were funded by the WPA Federal Art Project. These include the recently restored \"Airmail,\" in the Melrose Park Library (Chicago - 1937), The Old Days, in the Tuscola, IL, post office (1941), People of the Soil in Dixon, TN, which, although photographed for the 1996 book Tennessee Post Office Murals, is no longer open to view. and the City Hall mural in Sioux Falls, SD (1936).

  "text" : "Einer Nielsen (1894-1965) was a Danish physical medium and spiritualist. Nielsen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He travelled in Europe giving séances and claimed to be able to produce spirit materializations. He was originally investigated by the Danish Society for Psychical Research who produced a favourable report of his mediumship. However, the report was disputed by other researchers. Norwegian investigators suspected Nielsen to be a fraud and investigated him in 1922. The committee from the Kristiania University discovered that his ectoplasm was fake. Due to the new report by the Norwegians which was negative and covered strongly by the Danish news media, the original report by the Danish Society for Psychical Research was seen as an embarrassment and several members resigned from the society. The psychical researcher Harry Price sat with Nielsen in Copenhagen with \"unsatisfactory results.\" Nielsen was also caught hiding his ectoplasm in his rectum. In 1932, Johs Carstensen the leader of Nielsen's spiritualist circle wrote a pamphlet which exposed his tricks. Nielsen continued to work as a medium until his death but was never considered credible again by people outside his small circle of influence. He published the book Solid Proofs of Survival in 1950."

  "text" : "Emil Stock (1868–1951) was a Croatian industrialist and businessman. Stock was born in Split on 3 August 1868 to Abramo and Gentile (née Valenzin) Stock. He was raised with 11 siblings. Stock's paternal Ashkenazi Jewish family originated from Frankfurt am Main, German Empire, while his maternal Sephardi Jewish family arrived in Split during Napoleonic era. His father moved to Split in 1844 from Trieste, Italy. Stock graduated from the university as a civil engineer. After graduation he built the cement factory near Solin and also the factory for the asbestos-cement products. At the begin of 1900's Stock became involved in the production of alcoholic beverages. In 1905 Stock merged with Vid Morpurgo, another Croatian Jewish industrialist, to found the alcoholic beverages company \"Morpurgo, Stock e Comp.\" Stock 84 was being produced in the Split-based old Morpurgo factory. New company got the franchise to build the new liquor factory near Split (today part of Split). Factory concession was then challenged by the municipal prefect Vicko Mihaljević due to environmental issues. Some attributed this problem to the political conflict between owners of the factory and municipal authorities. Due to the disappointment of failing to get the concession, Stock and Morpurgo built the factory in Rovinj, Croatia. Factory was prosperous so Stock and his partner decided to build the second factory in Trieste. There Stock's brother Lionel already owned the steam wine distillery \"Distilleria a vapore Camis & Stock\" (now Fernet Stock) which produced cognac \"Medicinal\". Stock died in Trieste in 1951."

  "text" : "Chaim \"Efim\" Schachmeister (22 July 1894 - 6 October 1944) was a German violinist and bandleader. He also recorded under the pseudonyms Sascha Elmo and Joan Florescu. Born in Kiev to Romanian Jewish parents, from 1910 to 1913 he studied music at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin. In 1915 he joined the Popescu Gypsy Band (Zigeuner-Kapelle Popescu). In 1923 he became bandleader, and the following year embarked on a German tour that ended in April 1925 with an engagement at the Hotel Excelsior in Berlin. This was followed by engagements at top Berlin dancehalls such as the Barberina, the Palais de Danse, and the Pavillon Mascotte. Beginning in this period he signed with Deutsche Grammophon, which billed him as the \"King of all Dance-Violinists\". Even the Nazi-sponsored Encyclopedia of Jews in Music describes Schachmeister as a \"defining jazz bandleader of the Nazi era.\" Schachmeister's style evolved over the course of the 1920s from ragtime to the more modern jazz. His orchestra included many notable musicians, including the trumpeter Louis de Vries, the trombonist Henri van den Bossche, the banjoist Mike Danzi, and the pianist Adam Gelbtrunk. He himself played the violin, characteristically in a gypsy-manner, but was also capable of adjusting his style to a more Blues-influenced technique when necessary. His 1927 recording of \"Saint Louis Blues\" is illustrative of his tendency to combine elements of Blues and the shtetl style. As a Jew and a jazz musician, he was considered doubly degenerate by the Nazi regime, and left Germany soon after Hitler's rise to power. He first traveled to Belgium, but later settled permanently in Argentina, along with his fellow German-Jewish bandleaders Dajos Béla and Sam Baskini. He died in Argentina in 1944, aged fifty."

However, it was his personal projects in which he experimented with subjects, styles and techniques, which were exhibited in Mexico, other parts of Latin America, the U.S. and Europe from the start of his career in the 1960s until his death in 2003. His artistic work is basically of two types: the first exploring social issues and the second conceptualist, using common objects and concepts from other creative disciplines to create photographic images. Although he won no major awards for his work, he was selected as a judge for a number of competition and was inducted as a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana."

  "text" : "Eliot Dismore Chapple (ca. 1910 – 9 August 2003, Sarasota) was an American anthropologist. In 1941 he was one of the founders of the Society for Applied Anthropology, and its first president. His 1942 work with Carleton Coon applied the notion of conditioned learning to understanding the human use of symbols in various cultural contexts. He later invented the Interaction Chronograph to develop this concept. By 1970, he had understood these phenomena as emotional-interactional rhythms and part of fundamental biological rhythmic dynamics. Sociologists including George Herbert Mead developed symbolic interactionism from ideas including Chapple's insights. Eugene D'Aquili's work in Biogenetic Structuralism also referenced Chapple's work. In 2000 he received the  Conrad Arensberg Award (awarded for outstanding contributions to the field) from the American Anthropological Association."

  "text" : "Edward Palmer Thompson (3 February 1924 – 28 August 1993), usually cited as E. P. Thompson, was a British historian, writer, socialist and peace campaigner. He is probably best known today for his historical work on the British radical movements in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, in particular The Making of the English Working Class (1963). He also published influential biographies of William Morris (1955) and (posthumously) William Blake (1993) and was a prolific journalist and essayist. He also published the novel The Sykaos Papers and a collection of poetry. His work is considered to have been among the most important contributions to labour history and social history in the latter twentieth-century, with a global impact, including on scholarship in Asia and Africa. Thompson was one of the principal intellectuals of the Communist Party in Great Britain. Although he left the party in 1956 over the Soviet invasion of Hungary, he nevertheless remained a \"historian in the Marxist tradition\", calling for a rebellion against Stalinism as a prerequisite for the restoration of communists' \"confidence in our own revolutionary perspectives\". Thompson played a key role in the first New Left in Britain in the late 1950s. He was a vociferous left-wing socialist critic of the Labour governments of 1964–70 and 1974–79, and an early and constant supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, becoming during the 1980s the leading intellectual light of the movement against nuclear weapons in Europe."

  "text" : "Eduardo Luis Santos Correia Guedes (21 April 1941 – 29 August 2000) was a Portuguese film-maker involved with the independent British film collective Cinema Action. Guedes was born in Lisbon, the son of a judge, and initially studied chemical engineering at the University of Lisbon, but after refusing to take part in the Portuguese colonial wars, he left in 1961 to study film-making at the International Film School in London. After graduating in 1964, he worked as a tutor at the school. In 1965 he went to Brazil and made three documentaries (one, Rio Araguaia, was later networked by the BBC and French television). Returning to London, he freelanced as a film editor from 1968 to 1971, working with theatre director Peter Brook and Thames Television's Jeremy Isaacs, and was credited as editor of Maurice Hatton's 1970 film Praise Marx and Pass the Ammunition. In 1971, Guedes joined Cinema Action. This was a key component in the organisation of the Independent Film-makers Association which campaigned, among other things, for airtime for independents on the UK Channel 4 network. In 1981, Guedes shot and edited a documentary, So That You Can Live, which opened Channel 4's independent film slot. Cinema Action's first feature, Rocinante (1987) starred John Hurt and Ian Dury, was written and directed by Eduardo and his wife Ann Guedes, and produced by Gustav Lamche. A second feature, Bearskin: An Urban Fairytale (1990) starred Dury and Tom Waits. While fighting the cancer that would eventually cause his death, Guedes made two more features in Portugal: Pax (1994), starring Amanda Plummer and Isabel Ruth, and Knives And Angels (2000)."

  "text" : "Ernest Delahaye (1853–1930) was a French writer and essayist. He maintained a long and close friendship with Arthur Rimbaud with whom he first met in April 1865 when they attended school together in Charleville in the Ardennes region of France. He and Rimbaud had a shared interest in poetry, and he would help Rimbaud by making fair copies of his drafts for distribution to Rimbaud's literary friends. He was one of the few (seven) recipients of the privately printed A Season in Hell though Rimbaud later asked for it back to give it to someone else. According to Rimbaud biographer, Charles Nicholl, Rimbaud's \"[last] strictly dateable poem\" was contained in a letter to Delahaye of 14 October 1875. Through Rimbaud, Delahaye also met poet Paul Verlaine and became friendly with him. Verlaine wrote a poem - Sonnet Boiteux - which is dedicated to him. Delahaye mixed his civil service career, working at the Education Ministry, with writing biographical material on both Rimbaud and Verlaine, contributing first-hand accounts of the poets' lives and families. Most of Delahaye's correspondence with Rimbaud and Verlaine survives."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Noyce (October, 7 1930 – September 18, 1996) was an American philanthropist in the state of Maine. She was born Elizabeth Bottomley in Auburn, Massachusetts, United States, the daughter of Frank Bottomley and Helen McLaren. She was a 1951 graduate of Tufts University. In the early 1950s, Robert Noyce was working on a PhD at MIT, which is close to Tufts. In 1953, she married Robert Noyce and became Elizabeth Noyce. Robert Noyce received his PhD in 1953; he would become general manager of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel Corporation. The couple moved to California where Nobel laureate William Shockley had started Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in Mountain View, California in 1956. Robert Noyce was one of the \"traitorous eight\" who left Shockley in 1957 and started Fairchild Semiconductor. Fairchild's Robert Noyce and Texas Instruments' Jack Kilby are credited with inventing the integrated circuit. In 1968, Robert Noyce and Gordon E. Moore started Intel Corporation in Mountain View (later moving to Santa Clara, California in 1971). Intel became a huge financial success; it developed the first commercially available dynamic RAM (i1103), the first EPROM (i1702), and the first commercially available microprocessor (i4004). During this time, the couple lived in Los Altos, California. They had four children: William B., Pendred, Priscilla, and Margaret. Elizabeth loved New England, so the family acquired a 50-acre coastal summer home in Bremen, Maine. Elizabeth and the children would summer there. Robert would visit during the summer, but he continued working at Intel during the summer. Robert started an extramarital affair with an attractive, intelligent, 28-year-old, self-sufficient, divorced mother of three, Intel mask designer, Barbara Maness; the affair was an \"open secret\" at Intel. After Elizabeth learned of the affair, the marriage ended in divorce. Elizabeth received half of the couple's assets under California's community property law. Robert later married Ann Bowers, Intel's head of personnel. She then took up residence at the Maine summer home. She became the area's leading philanthropist and art collector. Among other major gifts, she founded the Libra Foundation. Elizabeth Noyce smoked cigarettes, developed emphysema, and died from a heart attack on September 18, 1996, aged 65, at her home in Bremen, Maine."

  "text" : "Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer professional, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and former contractor for the United States government who copied and leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 without prior authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by other newspapers including Der Spiegel and The New York Times. On June 21, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property. On June 23, he flew to Moscow, Russia, where he remained for over a month. Russian authorities granted him one-year asylum, which was later extended to three years. As of 2016, he was still living in an undisclosed location in Russia while seeking asylum elsewhere. A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a patriot and a traitor. His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy and the balance between national security and information privacy."

  "text" : "Eleanor Davies (1590–1652) was a prolific writer and prophet, publishing almost 70 pamphlets during her lifetime. The fifth daughter of George Tuchet, eleventh Baron Audley, she was learned in Latin, theology and law. In 1609, she married Sir John Davies, by whom she had three children. In 1625, she began caring for George Carr, a 13-year-old Scottish boy who was deaf-mute. While living with Davies, he began to utter prophecies and on 28 July 1625, Davies herself began prophesying. The same year she published her first pamphlet, A Warning to the Dragon and All his Angles, which related the Book of Daniel to contemporary political events. Her husband disliked her prophesying and burned at least one of her manuscripts. Eleanor predicted that he would die within three years; the next year, he was dead. In 1627, Davies remarried to Sir Archibald Douglas, a professional soldier. He also burned her manuscripts. Many of Davies's prophecies were based on anagrams. For instance, she read her own name Eleanor Audelie as \"Reveale O Daniel\". Henrietta Maria consulted her during her first pregnancy, although her relationship with the royal family was rocky. (She had foretold the death of the Duke of Buckingham, to the king's displeasure.) Davies was involved in several legal disputes during her life. After her first husband's death, she lost possession of her home at Englefield for a time, as well as her estate at Pirton. Later, after smuggling her illegally printed prophecies back into England from Amsterdam, she was arrested and fined £3000 and imprisoned. After her release, she was arrested again and sent to Bedlam for pouring tar over the altar at Lichfield Cathedral. Later in 1638 she was moved to the Tower, from which she was released in 1640. She was arrested twice more for debt and infringement of publishing laws."

  "text" : "Edward Oramel Austin, (December 1825 – August 1909) was a settler and founder of Austin, Pennsylvania, USA. Austin was born in December 1825 in Greene, New York. He traveled to Whites Corners, Potter County, Pennsylvania in 1841 along with his parents. He stayed there until 1856, when he settled in Freeman Run, Potter County, Pennsylvania. Austin lived in a small cabin he built which is now Main Street in Austin. In 1878 he built a larger home. There now stands a replica of Austin's home very close to where it originally stood. It houses a museum dedicated to him, the Austin Dam, the flood of 1911, and the overall history of the town. The original home was destroyed by the 1911 flood. He was a surveyor by trade. Also, he was a Justice of the Peace his entire life. After first settling in Austin, which at the time was part of Sylvania Township, Austin built a road of 3 miles (4.8 km) from his place to Costello, formally North Wharton. Later, in 1870, he built a state road from Austin to Keating Summit, to give a railroad connection to Austin. The clearing of his tract of land in Austin ultimately led to great manufacturing interests, and industrial development. Therefore, he was able to bring in the business of Goodyear and Mr. Garretson. The borough of Austin was named after him and it was officially incorporated in October 1888. He actually owned the 147 acres on which the town was built. Because of his skills as a civil engineer and land surveyor he was able to draw plans to lay out the town as he saw fit. From 1847 to 1849, Austin spent time studying law, although he had no intention of practicing. He also did some writing about Potter County which was incorporated in Egle's History of Pennsylvania. He was a Justice of the Peace for 55 years. It is possible he was the oldest serving in the state for a time. He was a school director for 40 years. Austin was elected County Commissioner in 1863 and served two terms. He served in the Civil War from late 1862 until July 1865. He was a member of the Masons at the level of Master Mason."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Rayner or Raynor, née Collier (1714–1800) was a British Unitarian benefactress. Mrs Rayner was the daughter of Jonathan Collier of Dalston (1676-1751), mercer and a Director of the South Sea Company. She married widower John Rayner [d. 1777] in 1754. Through her sister Susanna Collier, Mrs John Lewis, Mrs Rayner was the great aunt of Peter Burrell Jr., whose second daughter Isabella, married Lord Algernon Percy; Burrell's third daughter, Frances, married Hugh Percy, later 2nd Duke of Northumberland. Mrs Rayner converted to Unitarianism on hearing Theophilus Lindsey preach, following which, she became a regular attendant at Essex Street Chapel. She was a generous friend to, and a constant benefactress to Unitarian causes. She became acquainted with Joseph Priestley when he was preparing his removal to Birmingham in 1779. She contributed towards the cost of Priestley's moving, and gave him annual gifts of £50, as well as bearing the full cost of publishing his History of Early Opinions Concerning Christ (1786), which is dedicated to her. In addition, at Dr Priestley’s request, Mrs Rayner set aside some stocks for Joseph Priestley Jr. to purchase a partnership. When William Winterbotham was incarcerated for four years in Newgate prison for allegedly uttering the phrase \"French Revolution\" and criticising the slave trade, Rev Lindsey and Mrs Rayner were a constant support. Winterbotham subsequently named his two eldest sons Rayner Winterbotham (1798-1879) and Lindsey Winterbotham (1799-1871), respectively. Mrs Rayner died at her home in Titchfield Street on 11 July 1800, aged 84. In her will, she asked for a simple burial, in a lead-lined coffin in \"Mr Lindsay's vault\", in Bunhill Fields. She made numerous bequests, including £2,000 in public stock to Dr Priestley, and a separate bequest for his son William."

  "text" : "Elliott Vaughan Spiers (12 October 1973 – 15 January 1994) was an English actor. He appeared in an episode of Jim Henson's television series The Storyteller, \"The Heartless Giant\", and in two films, Paperhouse (1988) and Taxandria (1994). Taxandria was filmed in 1989, but was not released until 1994 due to lengthy post-production. During that period, Spiers suffered a negative reaction to an anti-malaria medication that left him gravely ill. He never recovered, and died at the Royal Free Hospital in London in 1994, prior to Taxandria's release. The film was dedicated to his memory."

Desmond is chiefly remembered for his efforts in relation to the establishment of California State University, Sacramento, in 1947. Desmond convinced the Senate's finance committee to withhold funding for the University of California until he had a commitment. Eleven of his own children and grandchildren graduated from the university, which, in recognition of his contribution, named one of its halls of residence after him. Earl D. Desmond died in office at Sacramento, aged 62. His son, Louis N. Desmond (1926-2012), later served as Deputy District Attorney, Sacramento County."

Her influence helped the DOB move away from negotiating with medical professionals and towards tactics of public demonstrations. Her understanding of, and work in, the Civil Rights Movement lent valuable experience on public protest to the lesbian and gay movement. Eckstein worked among activists such as Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, Barbara Gittings, Franklin Kameny, and Randy Wicker.

Although he died before recording technology, his quartet did get recorded between 1905 and 1910. He was also the founder of l'Ecole de mandolin française (The French Mandolin School). At the time that he was teaching in France and at the school, the mandolin was regaining popularity. There had been a decline since the early 19th Century, but around the beginning of the 20th Century from the 1880s to the 1920s there was a mandolin \"craze\" in which the instrument enjoyed new popularity. The movement in France was enough to found a movement of French mandolin artists, including Gabriel Leone, Giovanni Fouchetti and Gervasio. Mezzacapo \"became the most important exponent of his time,\" through his performing and organizing and teaching. Mezzacapo studied the mandolin in Naples, but went to France before he was 20. He performed with his family there, and their success was such that they performed Verdi's Othello in the Opéra Garnier. He also directed the Casino of Cannes orchestra, in the lounge of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg. His work led him to be given credit for adding to the mandolin's successful rise as an orchestral instrument. He was also given the honor of having an orchestral work dedicated to him, the Enrico Marucelli work Valtzer Fantastico."

After he lost his father at age of six, Bustani was raised by American missionaries at the Gerard Institute in Sidon – South Lebanon. Later, Bustani received help from a wealthy Lebanese businessman to study engineering at the American University of Beirut, from where he received a BS in that field by 1929. In 1930, he rejoined AUB as an Instructor in Physics and as a Graduate student he received his MA in Astro-Physics by 1932. A year later in 1933, he obtained a BS in civil engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. Back in Beirut after MIT, Bustani worked for a time with the Iraq Petroleum Company, but soon founded his own Contracting and Trading Company, CAT – a company involved in laying and constructing oil pipelines, building roads and constructing cities throughout the Middle East. Bustani was elected a Member of Parliament in Lebanon in 1951, an office he held until his death in 1963. On the 15th of March 1963, Bustani died in his own airplane, crashing into the sea off Beirut harbour."

  "text" : "Edward Cowles, an American psychiatrist, was the Medical Superintendent of the McLean Hospital in Massachusetts from 1879 to 1903. He was among the first hospital superintendents to advocate for hospital functions that encompassed patient treatment, research, and teaching. Cowles was born in Ryegate, Vermont, into a civic-minded family. His father served for many years in the state legislature. Cowles was educated in the local public schools, and attended Dartmouth College. He earned his A.B. in 1859 and his M.A. in 1861. He attended medical school at the College of Physicians and Surgeons and obtained his M.D. in 1863. He served a few months at the Hartford Retreat in Connecticut and then entered the U.S. Army until 1872. Following the Civil War, he was in charge of an Army hospital. Returning to Boston in 1872, he became Superintendent of the Boston City Hospital for seven years, where his Army experience influenced the organization and the administration of the hospital. During his tenure, the hospital built several wards, improved the ventilation in the wards, and established the first training school for hospital nurses. In 1879, he was invited to take the post of Superintendent of the McLean Asylum, where he remained until 1903. The McLean Asylum, renamed the McLean Hospital in 1892, was the first mental hospital in Charlestown, Massachusetts. The State Legislature issued a charter in 1811 to build a general hospital and an asylum for mentally-ill patients. The Asylum opened in 1818, three years before the general hospital. In 1895, it moved to Belmont, a Boston suburb. The first superintendent was Rufus Wyman (1818-1835), followed by Luther Bell (1836-1855 and 1857-1858) and John Tyler (1858-1871). Cowles became Superintendent in 1879. The original hospital organizers were aware of the British Quaker approach to mental illness called \"moral treatment\". This approach was used at McLean throughout its history and changed with advances in medicine. During his tenure, Cowles introduced many improvements in patient care based upon moral treatment. He removed bars from the windows in some wards, changed the name of \"boarders\" to \"patients\", increased recreational and occupational activities for patients, and started the first training school for nurses in a mental hospital. Moreover, he introduced research activities in the hospital, and added a pathology laboratory in 1888, a chemistry laboratory in 1900, and a physiological psychology laboratory in 1904. Cowles was a gifted administrator and opened advances in psychiatry. In 1887, during a leave of absence, he spent several months at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore to study psychology with Dr. Stanley Hall. He was a professor at Dartmouth (1895-1914), and a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School (1889-1914). In 1890, Dartmouth conferred Cowles with an honorary L.L.D. He gave lectures at Clark University, where he was a member of the Board of Trustees. He was active in professional organizations including the Boston Society of Psychiatry and Neurology, the American Neurological Association, and the American Medico-Psychological Association (later, the American Psychiatric Association), where he served as president from 1895 to 1896. Throughout his career, he believed strongly that psychiatry was part of medicine. In 1903, the McLean hospital Board of Trustees voted a mandatory retirement age of 64, and Cowles retired. He moved to Plymouth, Massachusetts, and opened his practice in Boston. He continued to lecture despite increasing deafness. He died in 1919."

  "text" : "Edward Timothy Palmer (1878-22 April 1947) was a British Labour Party politician. Born in Croydon, he worked in the insurance industry, and became a leading trade unionist in that sector. He held the office of president of the National Federation of Insurance Workers and general secretary of the Prudential Staff Union. Palmer first contested a parliamentary seat at the 1918 general election, standing without success at Canterbury. At the next general election in 1922 Palmer stood as Labour candidate at Greenwich. He failed to be elected, with his only opponent, George Hopwood Hume, holding the seat for the Conservative Party by a majority of more than 6,000 votes. A year later another general election was called. Palmer stood against Hume at Greenwich once more. However, on this occasion, it was a three-cornered contest, with the Liberal Party also having a candidate. The Liberals, although in third place, took nearly 6,000 votes from the Conservatives and Palmer was elected with a majority of 1,586 votes. The Labour Party had made a large number of gains, leading to the formation of the First Labour Government. This minority administration lasted only ten months, however. Following the loss of a vote of confidence in the House of Commons, a general election was held in October 1924. In spite of an increase in his vote, Palmer was unseated in a straight fight with the former member, George Hopwood Hume, regaining the seat for the Conservatives by a little over a thousand votes. Greenwich was one of forty seats lost by Labour, which became the main opposition party in the new parliament. The 1924 parliament ran a five-year term, with the next general election held in May 1929. The Labour Party saw a modest increase in its vote and gained a large number of seats, and the Liberal Party also took votes and seats from the Conservatives. In Greenwich Palmer regained the seat from Hume in a three-cornered contest with a majority of 3,618 votes. Labour again formed a minority government. In August 1931 the formation of a National Government led to a split in the Labour Party. When an election was called in October 1931 the supporters of the National Government won a huge majority, with Labour losing most of its seats. Hume regained the seat for the Conservatives by a large majority of more than 15,000 votes. Palmer's vote was also effected by the presence of a Communist candidate who secured over 2,000 votes. Palmer did not contest another parliamentary election, and retired from his union activities in 1934. In 1946 he was living at South Benfleet, Essex, and was elected to Essex County Council."

The first member of the Argyros family to rise to high posts, he fought with distinction against the Arabs in the east, before being disgraced ca. 907, possibly in connection with the flight of Andronikos Doukas to the Arabs. Rehabilitated soon after, he was appointed as strategos of Charsianon, from which post he oversaw the settlement of Armenian lords as march-wardens along the Empire's eastern frontier. Promoted to commander of the imperial bodyguard in late 908, he again fell into disgrace shortly after and died of poison (apparently a suicide) on his way to his estates."

  "text" : "The early life of Cuban revolutionary and politician Fidel Castro, born Lina Castro, spans the first 26 years of his life, from 1926 to 1952. Born in Birán, Oriente Province, Castro was the illegitimate son of Ángel Castro y Argiz, a wealthy farmer and landowner, and his mistress Lina Ruz González. First educated by a tutor in Santiago de Cuba, Fidel Castro then attended two boarding schools before being sent to El Colegio de Belén, a school run by Jesuits in Havana. In 1945 he began studying law at the University of Havana, where he first became politically conscious, becoming a staunch anti-imperialist and critic of United States involvement in the Caribbean. Involved in student politics, he was affiliated to Eduardo Chibás and his Partido Ortodoxo, achieving publicity as a vocal critic of the pro-U.S. administration of President Ramón Grau and his Partido Auténtico. Immersed in the university's violent gang culture, in 1947 he took part in a quashed attempt to invade the Dominican Republic and overthrow the military junta of Rafael Trujillo. Returning to student politics, Castro was involved with violent demonstrations in which protesters clashed with riot police, at which he became increasingly left-wing in his views. Traveling to Bogotá, Colombia, he fought for the Liberals in the Bogotazo before returning to Havana, where he embraced Marxism. In 1948 he married the wealthy Mirta Díaz Balart, and in September 1949 their son Fidelito was born. Obtaining his Doctorate of Law in September 1950, he co-opened an unsuccessful law firm before entering parliamentary politics as a Partido Ortodoxo candidate. When General Fulgencio Batista launched a coup and overthrew the elected presidency, Castro brought legal challenges against him, but as this proved ineffective, he began to think of other ways to oust Batista."

Born in Shaoshanchong, Shaoshan in Hunan province, Mao grew up as the son of Mao Yichang, a wealthy farmer and landowner. Sent to the local Shaoshan Primary School, Mao was brought up in an environment of Confucianism, but reacted against this from an early age, developing political ideas from pro-western literature. Aged 13 his father organised a marriage for him with Luo Yigu, the daughter of another land-owning family, but Mao denounced the marriage and moved away from home. In 1911 Mao began further education in the Hunanese capital of Changsha, where he came under the influence of republicanism, and became an admirer of republican revolutionary Sun Yat-Sen. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out between republicans and monarchists, Mao signed up as a soldier, although conflict subsided and he left the army after six months. Seeing himself as an intellectual, he became heavily influenced by classical liberalism, and began studying at the First Normal School of Changsha, as well as penning his first publications. With Xiao Zisheng he co-founded the Renovation of the People Study Society in April 1918 to discuss and perpetuate revolutionary ideas among students, before graduating in June 1919."

Later she lectured at the National Institute Högre lärarinneseminariet and at the University of Stockholm. She was a peace activist and attended the Women's Peace Congress (1915), also called the Hague Congress in 1915 and after the Second World War founded the Swedish Per Sundberg IAL. She collaborated with Nathanael Beskow in Birkagården. In 1932 she joined the Society of Friends. She wrote many important religious writings. From 1922 to 1929 she was married to the geographer Arnold Norlind. Her book about him (Arnold 1944) are at the top of her authorship. Her letters are also interesting, such as correspondence with Elin Wagner, Dear Ili, dearest Elin (ed. Gunnel Vallquist, 1989). In her final years she lived in Uppsala."

  "text" : "Edward Nathaniel Brush, M.D. (1852–1933) was an American physician, a mental hospital administrator, and an editor of psychiatric journals. He was born in Erie County in western New York, attended public and private schools, and entered the Department of Medicine of the University of Buffalo. He graduated in 1874. In 1871, he began working under Dr. Julius Miner, professor of Surgery, and owner of The Buffalo Journal of Medicine and Surgery. After receiving his medical degree, Brush opened his practice in Buffalo, New York. He served as editor for The Buffalo Journal of Medicine and Surgery from 1874 to 1878, and published four articles in the journal. He lectured in electro-therapeutics at the University of Buffalo medical school from 1877 to 1879, and was a visiting physician at the Sisters of Charity Hospital in Buffalo. In 1878, he accepted the position of assistant physician at the Utica State Hospital (originally the New York State Lunatic Asylum), and practiced there until 1884. The Utica State Hospital owned and published The American Journal of Insanity, with John Gray, M.D., as its editor. Brush became associate editor of the journal. In 1884, his former colleague at Utica, John Chapin, M.D. was called to the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia to become physician-in-chief of the Department of the Insane. Chapin invited Brush to join him in Philadelphia, and Brush accepted the offer. He worked at the hospital for two years. He continued working with the editorial board of The American Journal of Insanity. The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, a private mental hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, opened in 1891, and Brush accepted the job of physician-in-chief. He stayed until his retirement in 1920. He was a professor of psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Baltimore, Maryland from 1899 to 1915. He continued to serve on the editorial Board and as editor of The American Journal of Insanity, which became The American Journal of Psychiatry in 1921 when it was bought by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Brush became Editor Emeritus in 1931. Brush was active in psychiatric and mental health activities throughout his professional life. His editorial positions gave him a window on psychiatric activities in the country. He was influential among psychiatric and lay groups. He joined the American Neurological Association in 1890. He served as President of the Baltimore Medical Society in 1908, and the Medical Chirurgical Society of Maryland in 1904-1905. He was an honorary member of the Medico-Psychological Association of Great Britain and Ireland, an honorary member of the Société Royale de Médecine Mentale de Belgique, and was a Foreign Associate member of the Société Médico-Psychologique in Paris. He was President of the American Psychiatric Association from 1915 to 1916. During World War I, he served on the Advisory Board and the Draft board in Baltimore. After his retirement from Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, Brush remained in Baltimore until his death from pneumonia in 1933. In 1932, at the 40th meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, the annual dinner honored Brush on his 80th birthday. He was presented with a vellum scroll of appreciation for his 41 years on the editorial board The American Journal of Psychiatry, serving as Editor in Chief for 23 years."

  "text" : "Ellis Price or Prys (by 1514-8 October 1594) was a Welsh administrator and MP. He was a younger son of Robert ap Rhys of Plas Iolyn, the chaplain to Cardinal Wolsey. His grandfather Rhys Fawr ap Maredudd had fought at Bosworth with Henry VII. Ellis studied at St Nicholas Hostel, Cambridge and was awarded BCL in 1533 and DCL in 1534 and from the red gown of his degree was known as ‘Y Doctor Coch’ (‘The Red Doctor’). In 1535 he was appointed visitor of monasteries in Wales by Thomas Cromwell and played a leading role in their subsequent destruction. There were complaints about his immorality and arrogance and he was dismissed. In 1538 he became chancellor and commissary-general of the Diocese of St Asaph and sinecure rector of Llangwm, Llandrillo-yn-Rhos and Llanuwchllyn. At about this time he was sued in Chancery by the vicar of Llanarmon, Denbighshire, who complained that Price aided and abetted in the misappropriation of tithes, he also took part in an assault upon the Welsh scholar and translator of the New Testament into Welsh, William Salisbury of Llanrwst, Denbighshire, who was his brother-in-law. He was a Justice of the Peace for Merioneth in 1543 and from 1555 to his death, for Denbighshire from 1555 to his death, for Caernarvonshire from 1561 to his death, for Anglesey and Montgomeryshire in 1564, and for most Welsh counties by 1575. He was appointed High Sheriff of Denbighshire for 1548-49, 1556–57, 1568–69 and 1572–73 and High Sheriff of Merionethshire for 1551-52, 1555–56, 1563–64, 1567–68, 1573–74, 1578–79 and 1583-84. In the intervening years he also served as High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire (1558–59) and High Sheriff of Anglesey (1577–78 and 1585–86). He was elected MP for Merioneth in 1558 and 1563. Other offices included Custos Rotulorum of Merionethshire from 1558/59 to 1577 or later, member of the Council in the Marches of Wales from 1560 to his death, and Master in Chancery extraordinary. In 1560, the Crown awarded him the manor of Tir Ifan, with lands at Ysbyty Ifan and Penmachno. When Queen Elizabeth gave the lordship of Denbigh as a gift to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in 1564, Price, as steward of the estates, carried out acts of oppression in the area. He was on the commission granted by Elizabeth to hold the Eisteddfod at Caerwys in 1567. He married twice; firstly to Catherine, the daughter of Thomas Conway of Bodrhyddan, Flintshire, she bore him a son, and secondly to Ellyw, the daughter of Owain Pool, rector of Llandecwyn, Merioneth, she delivered two further sons and four daughters. His eldest son was the adventurer poet Tomos Prys."

At the height of his success he had three private planes (which he lent freely to politicians and public officials), and a famous singer (Gülben Ergen) as a girlfriend, and was one of the most famous people in Turkey. He went into hiding in 1998 after his business empire, much of it based on bank loans running into hundreds of millions of dollars obtained fraudulently, began to unravel. He was arrested in April 1999, charged with ordering the 1997 murder of Nesim Malki, and convicted in 2004. He was a friend of Alaattin Çakıcı and Mehmet Ağar, and had done business with Cavit Çağlar, Korkmaz Yiğit, Orhan Taşanlar and Yavuz Ataç. In 2013 he was sentenced to 15 years for money-laundering."

  "text" : "Emil Eichhorn (9 October 1863 - 26 July 1925) was a USPD politician and Chief of the Berlin Police during the 1918-1919 German Revolution. Eichhorn was born in Röhrsdorf near Chemnitz in October 1863 and became apprenticed as a glass workers in 1878, becoming active in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). He became a full-time official in 1893 and was the head of its press office from 1908–17, when he left with others to form the USPD where he played a similar role. On 9 November 1918 he led the occupation of Police headquarters in Berlin, the infantry guarding the building surrendering their weapons without a struggle. Inside the building Eichhorn took over the office of police chief and 600 political prisoners were set free. Amongst his deputies was Revolutionary Stewards activist Anton Grylewicz. The attempt to dismiss Eichhorn by the Prussian cabinet on 4 January 1919 and to replace him with an SPD member provoked mass opposition, with Eichhorn declaring the following day in front of a mass demonstration of 200,000, \"I got my job from the Revolution, and I shall give it up only to the Revolution.\" The attempt to remove Eichhorn had been preceded by slander in Vorwärts accusing him of having received Russian gold, possessing stolen foodstuffs and illegally bought arms. On 6 January both the Central Committee of the councils and the Berlin executive approved the decision to remove Eichhorn, however earlier that day supporters of Eichhorn had occupied several building including the Vorwärts office which was the precursor to the Spartacist uprising. In 1920 Eichhorn joined the KPD when it merged with the USPD left, but left after Paul Levi was expelled in 1921, although he remained a KPD deputy until he died. He died in Berlin in July 1925."

We must once again at this point emphasise that the aim of the collector has been to make his subjective choices and to base those choices on clear performances in taste. At the same time, Kunila’s collection has a museum-like quality since there are few such private collections in Europe that cover the art history of some country so thoroughly." ]

An enthusiastic soldier, he has been called \"the last knight errant\" because of his devotion to the chivalrous ideal. Involved in many military adventures, he was finally killed in an ill-fated personal expedition to Brittany in support of Francis II, Duke of Brittany. Woodville was referred to as Lord Scales after the death of his brother Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, who bequeathed the Scales lands to him.

With its avant-garde and pioneering music, using flute, harp, clarinet, strings, percussion and early synthesisers, Williams's Life on Earth score provided an evocative counterpoint to the visuals and Attenborough's commentary. Williams and his orchestra intricately crafted the music scene-by-scene to reflect the imagery on-screen. In one sequence examining the flight of birds, the instrumentation mirrors each new creature's appearance. He also created the Soundbeam music system. In 1996 he collaborated with Pip Eastop for a piece for the Arts Council of Great Britain. Williams died on 8 December 2013."

Eli returned to France and fought in the Crimean War. He returned to San Francisco by 1856 and with his new wife, Marie Louise (née Altabagoethe) he caught a boat to Victoria, British Columbia. From there, the family caught a boat to the mainland. he had two children, Bernard and Gaston. The family panned for gold at Rock Creek which is west of Osoyoos. During Eli's time at Rock Creek, his son Gaston fell into a miner's sluice box and drowned at two years of age. Eli, Marie Louise and Bernard headed for the Cariboo with the hopes of striking it rich. On their way, Marie Louise gave birth to another son, who they named Gaston. Father Pandosy met the family on the trail and convinced them to come to Okanagan Mission with him. In 1861, Eli registered a land claim northeast of the Mission. Eli built a log home and a trading post on his new property. His store soon became the social and business hub of the area. Eli and Marie Louise had two more children at the Mission, Aminade (1866) and Leon (1870). The Lequime family had over 1,300 heads of cattle and had more than two thousand acres of land. Eli lived in the Mission Valley for twenty-seven years. When he was seventy, Eli decided to move back to San Francisco. By 1888 Eli was in San Francisco with his daughter, Aminade and his niece, Dorothy. Marie Louise would join him a couple years later. In 1905, Eli Lequime's homestead was added to the K.L.O. company for $12,000.00."

  "text" : "Elizabeth B. Jenkins (born March 11, 1960 in Manhattan, New York) is an American writer of popular spiritual books including the international best seller The Return of The Inka: A Journey of Initiation and INKA Prophecies for 2012. She is a licensed psychotherapist, cultural investigator and worldwide teacher of the Inca tradition. Jenkins earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology from Carleton College, Northfield MN in 1983, a Master of Arts degree in Integral Counseling Psychology graduating in 1987 from the California Institute of Integral Studies, San Francisco, CA. In 1988 she began a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Integral Counseling from the Institute only to be inexplicably called to abandon her studies for a quest to Peru. In 1988, Jenkins traveled to Peru, where she experienced a spiritual awakening, which she described in her spiritual autobiographies: The Return of The Inka: A Journey of Initiation and INKA Prophecies for 2012 and Journey to Q'eros: Golden Cradle of the Inka. During this time she met the man who would become her teacher and guide, Juan Nunez del Prado, the foremost expert on the Andean Mystical Tradition. In 1990 she received the Hatun Qarpay – The Great Initiation Ritual. This ancient ritual springs out of the 16,000-year-old tradition of nature mysticism in the Andes – designed to bring the individual into direct, intimate and mystical relationship to the Divine through Great Nature herself. From 1992–1996, she served as Juan Nunez del Prado's apprentice working intensely with him initiating groups from all over the world in Cuzco, Peru. In 1997, with the publication of her first book, she independently facilitated her first Hatun Qarpay. Since then, Jenkins has initiated close to 1,000 people into the Hatun Qarpay becoming a skilled, spiritually proficient and an adept Inka guide. In May 2010, Elizabeth served as technical advisor and guide to the DISCOVERY CHANNEL's Les Stroud Beyond Survival into the Andean mountains to join the Q'ero Indians on their yearly pilgrimage to the holy site of Qollorit'i. In August 2013, she published The Fourth Level: Nature Wisdom Teachings of the Inka. This book is the culmination of close to twenty –five years of exploration into the InkaNature Mysticism. The Fourth Level is a primer on Nature Intelligence informed by the fourth-level teachings of Inka Nature Mysticism. It is a book for general consumption that translates the worldview of the Q'ero Indians and the Seven Energy Principles within the larger context of Inka Mysticism to the public. The book includes 7 Inka practices that allow the individual to experience each one of the principles directly.Jenkins tours internationally as a speaker on spirituality and mysticism, is a frequent lecturer to groups on eco-psychology, creativity, and spiritual experience."

The Baptist Foreign Mission Board initially sent him and his family to work among the Cherokees living in North Carolina, where he learned to speak and write in the Cherokee language, taught school at the Valley Town Baptist Mission, and became an itinerant preacher.Jones volunteered to lead one group of Cherokees to Indian Territory, when they were expelled from their ancestral homeland by the U.S. government. When they finally arrived, he reestablished the Baptist Mission and school and resumed his missionary activities. With the help of his son, John Buttrick Jones, he continued his work preaching, translating religious books, and serving as an advocate for the Cheokees. One author claims that Evan and his son \"...converted more American Indians to Christianity than any other Protestant missionaries in America\"."

  "text" : "Evangelos Katsioulis (born 19 January 1976, Ioannina, Greece) is a Greek medical doctor and psychiatrist. He currently lives and works in Thessaloniki, Greece. Katsioulis is known for his high intelligence test scores. There are several reports that he has achieved the highest scores ever recorded on IQ tests designed to measure exceptional intelligence. Statistical interpretation of these numbers estimates that Katsioulis' performance, when assuming a normal Gaussian distribution of IQ scores in the general population, is to be expected in one out of every 38,000,000,000 people. He is the founder of the World Intelligence Network (WIN), an international organization of high IQ societies and of the organization AAAA.GR, a pioneer voluntary team for the detection and support of gifted individuals in Greece."

  "text" : "Edward Adam Strecker, M.D. (1896-1959) was an American physician, a psychiatric educator, a professor of psychiatry at several medical schools, and a leader in American psychiatry during the mid-twentieth century. Strecker was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and received his early education at parochial schools, including St. Joseph’s College and La Salle College in Philadelphia. He entered Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia in 1907, and graduated in 1911. After his internship at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, he joined the staff of the Pennsylvania Hospital (Philadelphia) in 1913. He also taught psychiatry at Jefferson Medical College where he was later appointed professor of psychiatry and neurology. In 1925, he moved to Yale University as professor of psychiatry and taught until 1931 when he returned to Philadelphia to resume teaching at Jefferson Medical College. In 1932, he accepted an appointment as professor and chair of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Medical College, where he remained until retirement in 1952. During World War I, Strecker entered the U.S. Army at the rank of major and served as a divisional psychiatrist in France. During World War II, he served as a consultant to the Army and was active in recruiting and training psychiatrists to serve in the Army. Strecker played a major role in American psychiatry as a teacher, and he consulted for numerous government agencies and organizations. He was a member of the Philadelphia County Medical Society, the Pennsylvania Medical Society, the American College of Physicians, a member of the Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, the American Neurological Association (vice President, 1942), the American Psychiatric Association (president, 1943-1944), and a Fellow of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association of Great Britain. He delivered the Salmon Lecture of the New York Academy of Medicine in 1939. He was awarded honorary degrees from La Salle College (D.Litt), St. Joseph’s College (D.Sc.), and Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (LLD). Strecker’s professional writings reflect his active career. He published over 100 monographs and journal articles including his textbooks on psychiatry and neurology. His first textbook, Practical Clinical Psychiatry, was co-authored with Franklin Ebaugh, professor of psychiatry at Colorado Medical School, and had eight editions (1940-1957). Strecker later wrote Fundamentals of Psychiatry with other professionals, and the book had six editions (1942-1952). His teaching was based on a case record approach which followed Adolph Meyer, M.D. professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. Meyer believed that psychiatric illness was part of the life trajectory of the patient. While Strecker’s early publications were based on descriptive psychiatry, his later monographs and articles included the contributions of psychoanalytic theory and practice in the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Strecker retired from teaching in 1952. He died in 1959."

  "text" : "Erik Bredal (1608 – 18 May 1672) was a Danish-born, Norwegian Lutheran Bishop. Erik Bredal was born in the town of Rudkøbing, on the island of Langeland in south-central Denmark. Bredal came from a clerical family. His father was a parish priest in Rudkøbing and provost in Nørre Herred. His grandfather was vicar of Vinding Parish, in Tyrsting Herred. After schooling at Sorø Academy, he came to Nykøbing Falster, where he became rector of the Latin school in 1633. From 1637, he was a student at the University of Rostock, earning his Magister degree in 1639. In 1640 he became pastor of Church of Our Saviour (Vor Frelsers Kirke) at Christianshavn on the island of Amager. The community and church were both in formation at that time. In 1643, he was appointed Bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros (Trondhjems Stift) which included Trøndelag. His zealous reform efforts led to clashes of interests with local priests on a series of issues, such as the appointment of resident curates, the status of priests' widows, and duties and quality of education. Trøndelag was ceded in 1658 to Sweden under the terms of the Treaty of Roskilde and was ruled by Sweden. Clergy could retain their positions if they swore allegiance to the Swedish king. Bishop Bredal refused to submit to the enemy, and temporally relocated north to Trondenes in Troms county with his family. The Treaty of Copenhagen in 1660 restored Trøndelag to Norwegian control and placed Erik Bredal back as Bishop of Trøndelag where he served until his death in 1672."

His political career hit its first success in 1999 when he was elected into the Abia State House of Assembly to represent Obingwa East State Constituency. In 2003 he was re-elected and subsequently named Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly until Governor Kalu nominated him as deputy governor in 2006. He contested the 2007 Senatorial elections for Abia South Senatorial District on the platform of Progressive Peoples Alliance but lost to Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe in a post election legal battle. On August 18, 2010, Governor Theodore Orji again named him as deputy governor to succeed Chris Akomas. At the swearing-in ceremony, Governor Orji said he chose Nwakanma because Nwakanma has garnered a large wealth of experience as a good follower and would make a visionary and good leader. Eric Acho Nwakanma nursed the ambition of becoming Governor of Abia State at end of Theodore Orji's tenure by 2015. Initially believed to be the strongest contender for the position, he however lost the bid to his brother-in-law Okezie Ikpeazu. In April 2013 President Goodluck Jonathan appointed him as Chairman of the Board of National Neuro Psychiatry Hospital, Enugu."

  "text" : "Eric Gray was a stills photographer whose work was featured in Life Magazine. His career was mainly in the British film industry and it and was on two Anthony Asquith pictures, Shooting Stars 1928 and A Cottage on Dartmoor 1929, that his reputation began to emerge. Gray operated his own studio at 17 Rupert Street close to the Trocadero in central London between 1931 and 1940 and his camera studies included Chili Bouchier and Harry Milton (Assistant director on Bitter Sweet). During the war he joined the Royal Observer Corps from 1939 to 1945. In 1941 Gray was hired as a stills photographer on Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft is Missing and a selection of these photographs was used to promote the film in Britain and America. Four years later, Gray was again working with Powell and Pressburger. A Matter of Life and Death (US title Stairway to Heaven) was filmed at Denham Studios and on location in Devon. Gray was the main stills photographer working behind the scenes on location at Saunton Sands in Devon, while Fred Daniels focused on gallery portraits in the studio. Both Daniels and Gray were credited as creating the most iconic images of the wartime romantic drama starring David Niven and Kim Hunter. Their work was published in the film classic series.In 1948 the British Film Academy arranged the first public exhibition on the art of still photography in feature films and documentary film. The exhibition was also supported by the film union A.C.T. and marked a greater understanding and appreciation of their work as opposed to enlargements from motion picture frames. Gray chose to submit stills from A Matter of Life and Death which were approved by the committee including Michael Powell and Roger Manvell. In the 1950s Gray worked with Hollywood director John Huston on Moulin Rouge 1952 and Beat the Devil. Both films were filmed at Shepperton Studios in England. In the later, Eric Gray was hired to create studio portraits of Humphrey Bogart, a blonde Jennifer Jones and Peter Lorre. Other notable stills in a long career included Room at the Top in 1959. Gray's portrait of Laurence Harvey was featured in John Kobal's study of Portraits of the British Cinema.—nigelarthur59@@ 05:59, 21 June 2014 (UTC)"

He married a daughter of Lieutenant-colonel Ewan Macpherson, who was at one time stationed with the 99th Regiment of Foot in Tasmania. Her sister, Mary Macpherson, married Alfred Cox, who was thus his brother-in-law. He was on the committee of the Canterbury A&P Association from 1882 until his death, and was president in 1882. The vacancy on the board of the A&P Association was filled by appointing Arthur Rhodes. Gray died suddenly on 14 July 1895 at his home in the Christchurch suburb of Hoon Hay from a cerebral hemorrhage. He was survived by his wife, four daughters, and two sons. He was buried at Halswell Cemetery."

  "text" : "The early revolutionary activity of Chinese revolutionary and politician Mao Zedong lasted for eight years, from 1919 to 1927. At the start of this period, Mao had moved to Peking, where he became a librarian's assistant at Peking University, simultaneously exploring both anarchism and Marxism and converting to the latter. Returning to Hunan in the context of the May Fourth Movement, Mao co-founded the Hunanese Student Association who began to publish politically radical literature. His publications earned Mao growing fame within the Chinese revolutionary movement, but invoked the anger of Hunanese Governor Zhang Jinghui, who repeatedly shut Mao's operation down. In 1921, the Communist Party of China was founded in Shanghai by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao, with Mao becoming an early member and attending its first National Congress the following year. In 1923, Mao was elected to the Party's Committee, relocating to Shanghai. The Party agreed to a revolutionary alliance with the Kuomintang nationalist party, a move which gained Mao's enthusiastic support."

  "text" : "Esther Marion Armstrong was the widow of Edwin Howard Armstrong, notable for continuing his patent battles after despair drove him to suicide.It took 13 years, but she did win all the patent fights, winning financial settlements that restored her wealth.In her final years she established awards and took other steps to honor her husband's accomplishments. When Marion met Edwin Armstrong she was the secretary of David Sarnoff then an executive at RCA.Armstrong was then both an inventor and Professor of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University. He had sold his patents for the autodyne (regenerative circuit) and superheterodyne receiver to Westinghouse, which then owned RCA, making him a millionaire, and owner of a large block of RCA stock.Marion was described as \"tall and strikingly handsome\". Armstrong built Marion what was described as \"the world's first portable radio\".He bought her a Hispano-Suiza sports car as a wedding gift, when they wed in 1923. By 1933, Edwin Armstrong had filed key patents for techniques he developed that were to eventually make FM Radio successful. His professional relationship with Marion's former boss, Sarnoff, fractured when Sarnoff who was by then the President of RCA, concluded the development of FM Radio was not in the best interests of RCA, which operated an extensive network of commercial AM Radio stations. RCA and over a dozen other electronics firms including Motorola ended up filing competing patents for FM Radio. These protracted patent fights brought Armstrong to the brink of financial ruin.According to \"They made America\" Armstrong was oblivious to the toll his struggle was taking on Marion.Marion spent months in a mental hospital after she threw herself into the East River.Finally, on November 1, 1953, Edwin told Marion that he had used up almost all his financial resources.In better times funds for their retirement was put in her name, and he asked her to release a portion of those funds, so he could continue the legal battles. She declined, and suggested he consider accepting a settlement. Enraged, Edwin picked up a fireplace poker, and swung at her. Marion left the apartment, and never saw him again. After just under three months of separation, on January 31, 1954, Armstrong wrote Marion an apology and threw himself from his high-rise apartment. Marion inherited her husband's patents, and, by 1967, won all of those patent fights. According to Jim Wesley's book Radio Memories, after she had begun to win the patent fights, she established awards to honor Armstrong's memory as a radio innovator.Marion established the Armstrong Memorial Research Foundation. Marion died on August 8, 1979, in New Hampshire, where she had made her home."

  "text" : "Ella Little-Collins (1914 - 1996) was an American civil rights activist and the half-sister of Malcolm X. She was born in Butler, Georgia, to Earl Little and Daisy Mason-Little; her paternal grandparents were John (Big Pa) Lee Little and Ella Gray-Little, and her siblings, including half-siblings, were Mary, Earl Lee Jr., Wilfred, Philbert, Hilda, Reginald, Malcolm, Wesley, and Evonne. She worked as congressman Adam Clayton Powell's secretary, the manager of her mother's grocery store, and an investor in house property, which she let out as rooming houses. She joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and helped establish its mosque in Boston and a day-care center attached to it, although she left the Nation in 1959 to become a Sunni Muslim. She supported black and ethnic studies programs in universities across the United States and founded the Sarah A. Little School of Preparatory Arts in Boston. In his autobiography, Malcolm X wrote about the impact his first meeting with his half-sister had on him. She came to visit when he was in seventh grade, and he described her as \"the first really proud black woman I had ever seen\" and wrote \"I had never been so impressed with anybody.\" At the end of the school year, he moved to Roxbury to live with her, and she was his guardian until he turned 21. Her home, the Malcolm X – Ella Little-Collins House, is the last known surviving childhood home of Malcolm X. Its exterior was designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1998. When Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam in 1964, Little-Collins paid for him to make the Hajj. She also paid his funeral and business expenses after his assassination, and took over his Organization of Afro-American Unity, including his project of giving 35 scholarships from Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt, and from the University of Ghana to students wishing to study overseas. In 1988, both of Little-Collins' legs were amputated due to gangrene. She died in 1996. The Ella Collins Institute at the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center is named after her; its goal is \"to establish a vibrant community by joining a classical understanding of Islam with modern scholarship and a healthy understanding of the current cultural context.\""

He was devoted to hunting and warfare. In 1459 he introduced restrictions to the church's jurisdiction. He was unable, however, to fend of the devastation of his bishopric by the neighbouring princes. During his time in office, the Seven Chapters (Sieben Stifter) emerged for the first time as part of the Territory of the former Principality of Hildesheim. In 1469, his city forged a defensive alliance with Duke Otto of Lüneburg. He died of grief on 22/23 Jul 1471, as a result of the misfortune suffered in the war with Duke Frederick."

Charter members were artists, journalists, teachers and writers and included Leticia Antezana de Alberti, Elvira Benguria, Fidelia Corral de Sánchez, Marina Lijerón (who would later marry to Betachini), Julia Reyes Ortiz de Cañedo, Ema Alina Palfray, Emma Pérez de Carvajal, María Josefa Saavedra, Ana Rosa Tornero de Bilbao la Vieja, Ana Rosa Vásquez, and Etelvina Villanueva y Saavedra. They organized their own journal \"Eco Femenino\". From its inception, Tornero ran the magazine printing literary submissions and articles on feminism. In the 1930s, Villanueva y Saavedra founded another important feminist group, Legión Femenina de Educación Popular de America (Feminine Legion for American Popular Education). This group sought to improve the status of women, regardless of social class, by advocating for changes in the legal code. They provided assistance to the poor and defended unwed mothers and children. They were able to do this because they argued that they were “natural” mothers and so this was a form of mothering but on a higher level and with a new term, \"social mothering.\" In addition to this, the organization allowed Bolivian women to enter the international feminist debates."

  "text" : "Enrico Bignami was an Italian merchant, and the editor of La Plebe, a socialist newspaper. Enrico Bignami was born in Lodi, Lombardy, on 3 December 1844.He came from a poor family. In 1866 and 1867 he fought with Giuseppe Garibaldi.He founded La Plebe in Lodi in 1868 to promote Giuseppe Mazzini's ideas, financing the paper from his import business.The first issue appeared on 4 July 1868. At first it was published bi-weekly, although during the following years it appeared more or less frequently. The paper would last until 1883, despite seizures of issues and several arrests of the editor. It gave continuity from the left wing of the Risorgimento to the post-unification labor movement and the later elaboration of socialist ideology in northern Italy. Until the early 1870s La Plebe took a mainstream democratic position.However La Plebe was critical of the institutions ruling the new state of Italy, which it saw as opposed to the ideals of the Risorgimento.Bignami became enthusiastic about the 1871 Paris Commune, and from then the paper took a socialist line.Bignami moved to Milan in 1875, taking the paper with him.He helped to found a number of worker's leagues in the years that followed, and in 1876 was one of the founders of the North Italy Federation of the International.He became a close friend of Osvaldo Gnocchi-Viani. At several times, particularly in 1879-80, he tried to organize a congress at which all left-wing democratic and socialist movements would be united, but he did not succeed. La Plebe played a central role in the formation of the Italian Workers Party (POI) in Milan in 1882.La Plebe stopped publication in 1883.In the late 1880s Bignami was a promoter of establishing the Milan Chamber of Labor.He founded the socialist publishing house Biblioteca socialista in 1895.In 1898 he moved to Lugano in Switzerland to avoid being arrested.From 1906 to 1918 he edited Coenobium (Common Life). Bignami died in Lugano on 13 October 1921."

  "text" : "Elsie Lincoln Benedict (1885–1970) was advertised as the best known women's speaker during the 1920s, speaking to over 3 million people in her lifetime and writing on what Napoleon Hill and Dale Carnegie and a long list of men would do later. She was an American suffragist leader representing the State of Colorado for the Women's Right to Vote. She promoted the law of attraction through her many worldwide lectures. Benedict was born on November 1, 1885 in Osborne, Kansas to William and Adella (Allen) Vandergrift. She was a student at the University of Colorado, Denver, Colorado; Columbia University, Chicago, Illinois; Radcliffe College,(the female equivalent to Harvard, as Harvard did not accept females then), Cambridge, Massachusetts specializing in psychology and anthropology. In 1914, married Ralph Paine Benedict, of Boston, Massachusetts, a Harvard graduate. Formerly writer for Denver Evening Post and other newspapers, Chautauqua lecturer, organizer for National American Woman Suffrage Association,: Founder 1918 Benedict School of Opportunity (lecture and correspondent courses), headquarters in New York and San Francisco, Member National Association of Pen Women, National Association Business and Professional Women, Author. During her college career, she held over 12 gold medals for oratory. She was the first woman to win a place in an intercollegiate debate team. In 1909, Colorado Governor John F. Shafroth appointed her the official reporter of the Colorado Senate. After serving this capacity for three years, she was appointed Chief of the Advertising Department of the State Land Office. In 1913, she resigned to become a political editor of the Denver Press and later of the Denver Post, the largest daily in Colorado at the time. Progressive Judge Ben Lindsey wrote of Mrs. Benedict's speaking efforts on woman's suffrage, \"Mrs. Benedict is one of the best known of our progressive Denver woman. She has held positions of trust and responsibility and for several years has been on the editorial staff of leading Denver newspapers in the most important capacities. She is one of the real genuine women of Denver, who has always stood for right and justice.\" She drew big audiences here in the pre-World War II decades, discussing a wide variety of subjects from choosing personality colors in clothes to fit the individual, to doing well in marriage and in business. In a 1922 lecture at Scottish Rite Auditorium, she commented, “Most people use less brains in selecting the person with whom they are to spend their lives than they do in choosing an automobile, a bicycle or a cut of steak. Love isn’t enough; there must also be understanding.” Benedict served as head of the Benedict School of Opportunity, \"The Traveling University for Men and Women\", was founder of International Opportunity League, and president of the Elsie Lincoln Benedict Club. In her lifetime, she traveled to 55 countries and her book, \"Our Trip Around the World\", was considered the most extensive travel book of its time. She recorded her travels, not only in her writings, but in her postcard and scrapbook collection. Around 1920, Elsie had already achieved her goal in becoming a millionaire and built a cobblestone cottage home in the Carmel Highlands, California, with breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean which served as a quiet and spiritual place which she and Ralph could continue their writings and host friends. A 1929 postcard taken by photographer, L.S. Slevin, featured the exterior of her cobblestone cottage named \"House by the Side of the Road\". In May 1926, American Evangelist and Four Square founder, Aimee Semple McPherson, disappeared for months and the case remains unsolved. In the trial following her reappearance, five witnesses testified they saw Aimee at the Benedict cottage in the Carmel Highlands. In Don Ryan's 1927 book, Angel's Flight, he writes of both Elsie Lincoln Benedict and Aimee Semple McPherson within the same few pages as both being prominent, influential and motivating female leaders of the time. Because Aimee was very careful not to associate in public with those people that her religious followers would see as suspect, personal friendships were kept in private. Elsie's work drew heavily on the deep American metaphysical tradition, and Aimee would have kept her distance from that (as she kept her distance from Theosophy, Christian Science, etc.) of a public relationship to Elsie. In 1932, Elsie and Ralph adopted a son, Anthony Gorman, whom she renamed Elson (Elsie's son), while lecturing in Sydney, Australia. In 1934, at the age of 15, he was the youngest student at the time to be accepted into California State Institute of Technology. While at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he developed the first Squib for NASA and corresponded with Albert Einstein. Anthony left Caltech to fly in the Royal Australian Air Force (ANZAC) in Libya after World War II. Anthony married and returned to the United States to raise his family of two daughters and one son. Elsie's husband, Ralph Benedict died in 1941. Devastated by the loss of her husband, Elsie retired from public life. She spent the rest of her life traveling the world and visiting family. She died in San Francisco, California on February 15, 1970. Luigi Kleinsasser's dedicates his 2012 book, \"The Book of Life: Find Your Perfect Self, Job, Partner, Life\" to the inspiration and research of Elsie Lincoln and Ralph Payne Benedict. She shares a crypt with her husband at Forest Lawn in Glendale, California in the Gardenia Terrace. In 2013, her original travel scrapbooks, pictures, journal, lecture award trophies, and her 300 page manuscript on Australia was returned to her family heirs as they came across it on EBay just three days before the auction was ending. True to Elsie's writings, \"There are no accidents. Everything that happens in our individual world, just as every occurrence in the material universe, is brought about by the operation of law.\" Her works are currently undergoing republishing by her family, which still owns the copyright to her works from 1923 and beyond. The Elsie Lincoln Vandergrift Memorial Scholarship was established at the University of Denver to a student who shows promise and accomplishment in psychology."

She served as superintendent of the Barre town schools beginning in 1906, and spent 16 years as town treasurer (from 1912-1928). She lost the Republican primary for the Vermont House election to Burt L. Richardson, but then ran in the general election on the \"Citizen's Party\" and won. She thus became the first woman elected to the Vermont House of Representatives in 1921, representing the town of Orange. She was given the first choice of seats in the House, and, as reported by the Rutland Herald, \"She chose seat no 146, and for a long time no mere man had the courage to select seat no. 145, which adjoins hers. The seat stood vacant for over an hour until Horatio Luce of Pomfret took the dare of his fellow members and sat down beside Miss Beard amid a storm of laughter and applause.\" Her first bill in the Vermont House of Representatives, Act 218, provided $2 a week child support for women whose husbands were \"incapacitated by an incurable disease.\" It passed. She served one term in the House, and in 1923 became the first woman to be elected to the Vermont Senate, where she chaired the Library Committee. Her first successful bill as Senator made it possible for county sheriffs to hire women as deputies."

  "text" : "Emil Ernst August Tietze (15 June 1845, Breslau – 4 March 1931, Vienna) was an Austrian geologist. He received his education at the Universities of Breslau and Tübingen. Afterwards, he joined the Geological Survey of Austria (1870), an agency that Tietze would be associated with until his retirement in 1918. In 1902 he became its director. Primarily known for his geological surveys of Eastern Europe (the Carpathian Mountains, Galicia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro), he also conducted important research involving the stratigraphy and tectonics in the Elburz Mountains of Persia. Tietze was interested in the processes of erosion that were responsible for modern-day land formations, in particular karst topography. Tietze's wife, Rosa von Hauer, was the daughter of another notable Austrian geologist, Franz Ritter von Hauer. Their son, Heinrich Franz Friedrich Tietze, became a mathematician."

  "text" : "Emilio Elizalde (born March 8, 1950) is a Spanish physicist working in the fields of gravitational physics and general relativity. Of Basque heritage, he was born in Balaguer, about 25 km northeast of Lleida, the province capital. He finished double undergraduate majors in Physics and Mathematics at the University of Barcelona in 1972 and 1973, followed by a masters and later a Ph.D. (1976) degree at the same institution. In 1977, he married Maria Carmen Torrent, who is currently Professor of Applied Physics at the Technical University of Catalonia. The years immediately after the death of Franco were chaotic, offering young academics few opportunities, and so Elizalde spent his postdoctoral years abroad with Rudolf Haag at the II. Institut für Theoretische Physik of the Hamburg University. Later he was to return to the Department of Theoretical Physics of the University of Barcelona as a faculty member. In 1992, he obtained a research position at the Spanish Higher Research Council (CSIC), combining this position with collaborative research and teaching at the University of Barcelona. His well-regarded bookTen Physical Applications of Spectral Zeta Functions (1995) was written during the period of his association with CSIC. Although supposedly an \"elementary\" book on the subject, this book includes an important generalization of the Chowla–Selberg formula. In 1996, Elizade was a founding scientist in the creation of the \"Institut d’Estudis Espacials de Catalunya\" (IEEC), a research structure created by the Catalan Government, and in 1999, he played a key role in founding the Institute of Space Sciences (ICE, \"Institut de Ciències de l'Espai\"). As of 2013, he is still employed at the Institut de Ciències de l'Espai. Elizalde received the Gold Medal of Tomsk State Pedagogical University, where he also obtained an honorary professorship. Elizalde is editor-in-chief of Galaxies and member of the editorial boards of several other journals, including the Journal of Physics A. As of November 2013, the Astrophysics Data System lists 3035 citations to his publications (self-citations excluded), giving him an h-index of 38. On March 8–10, 2010, in celebration of Elizalde's 60th birthday, a conference was organized to discuss current progress in the main areas of his research: cosmology, quantum vacuum fluctuations and zeta functions. A volume of proceedings was published."

Although the Grand Council had, in 1645, abolished the elaborate ceremony for installing a new dogaressa, because of its large expense to the state and to the Doge, Valiero convinced the Council to grant an exception. As such, on March 4, 1694, Elisabetta Querini appeared clad in a cloth of gold robe adorned with sable, with a white veil and corno ducale, (the version of ducal crown worn by the Doge and his wife) adorned with jewels, and a large diamond cross on her chest. Together Valiero and his wife sat on the throne of Venice and received counselors, ministers, judges, and the capis of the Ten. She also had the traditional Solemn Entry 4 March 1694. She was the last dogaressa to be crowned. Elisabetta used her right as dogaressa to receive foreign dignitaries and accept gifts from them: both this right, as well as the right for a dogaressa to wear a crown, was forbidden after the reign of her spouse in 1700."

  "text" : "Sir Edward Strickland, KCB, (7 August 1821 – 18 July 1889) was a British Army officer, commissariat officer in charge of the British army of occupation in Greece from 1855 to 1857 and a vice-president of the Geographical Society of Australasia. Strickland was the son of Gerard Edward Strickland (a cadet of the Stricklands of Sizergh), by Anne, daughter of Francis Cholmeley, of Brandsby Hall, Yorkshire. He was born at Loughglynn House, County Roscommon and married, first in 1842, Georgina Frances (died 1876), daughter of Frederick Augustus Hely, of Enghurst, Sydney, New South Wales, and secondly, in 1877, Frances Marie, only daughter of General Tatton Browne Greave, C.B., of Orde House, Northumberland. Having entered the Army, Strickland was appointed Deputy-Assistant Commissary-General in 1840; Assistant Commissary-General in 1854; Deputy Commissary-General in 1861, and Commissary-General in 1880. The next year Sir Edward Strickland, who was created C.B. in 1857 and K.C.B. in 1879, retired from the army. He served in the Crimea during the first year of the war, including the battle of the Alma and the advance on Sebastopol, and was commissariat officer in charge of the British army of occupation in Greece from 1855 to 1857. He was also engaged in the New Zealand Wars from 1864 to 1866, and in South Africa from 1877 to 1879. After retiring from the army he came to reside in Sydney, and took a prominent part in the work of the Geographical Society of Australasia, of which he was vice-president, especially of the New South Wales branch, of which he was president. Sir Edward is stated to have been the first to suggest the despatch of the famous Soudan Contingent. He died in Sydney on 18 July 1889, survived by his only child, Fanny Cecelia (1844-1922).The Strickland River in Papua New Guinea was named after him."

In 1907, she went to Berlin to complete her music education and became engaged to the sculptor R. Tait McKenzie, who crossed on the same boat, the S.S. \"Marquette\", from Philadelphia. They were married in August 1907 at Dublin Castle, with the Earl and Countess of Aberdeen, who had known Tait McKenzie earlier when he was household physician to the Canadian Governor-General's staff, as part of the wedding party. The couple moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from Montreal when Tait McKenzie was appointed as the first professor of Physical Education at the University of Pennsylvania. Ethel O'Neil McKenzie was involved in the cultural and civic life of the city. She arranged music recitals and lectured on music. A collection of her poetry, \"Secret Snow\", was published in 1932.In 1930, the McKenzies bought the Mill of Kintail in Almonte, Ontario, Canada for their summer home, and supervised the mill's restoration. R. Tait McKenzie died in 1938 and Ethel McKenzie died in 1952. The Mill of Kintail is a conservation area and museum managed by the Mississippi Valley Conservation Authority and Lanark County, Ontario."

His column \"Hollywood Notes\" was syndicated by the Newspaper Enterprise Association. Johnson was the source of Groucho Marx's famous quote, “I don’t want to belong to any club that would accept me as one of its members.” Johnson published the remark in his column of 20 October 1949, claiming it came from Marx’s resignation letter to the Friars Club. In the late 40's and early 50's, Johnson hosted a TV series about Hollywood called Erskine Johnson's Hollywood Reel which aired on Paramount Television Network's flagship station KTLA. Between 1937 and 1960, Johnson appeared in eight movies and two TV series, mostly as himself or as a reporter. His most memorable screen appearance was in the 1947 comedic mystery The Corpse Came C.O.D. in which he had a cameo as himself with many of his rival gossip columnists."

  "text" : "Emil Reich (24 March 1854 – 11 December 1910) was a Hungarian-born historian of a Jewish family who lived and worked in the United States and France before spending his final years in England. Will Johnston has called Reich \"a flowering of Hungarian improvisation\" and \"an unduly neglected English-language essayist\". Reich's work, while lively, often fell down on detail and completeness. He loved paradox."

  "text" : "Ernest Ndjissipou (born September 24, 1972 in Bangui) is a retired Central African long-distance and marathon runner. He represented the Central African Republic in three editions of the Olympic Games (1992, 1996, and 2004), and has also set both a national record and a personal best of 2:18:06 in men's marathon from the 2003 IAAF World Championships in Paris, France. Ndjissipou made his official debut as a long-distance runner in the men's 5000 metres at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where he finished twelfth in the last of four preliminary heats with a time of 14:40.12, trailing behind leader Salvatore Antibo of Italy by one minute and ten seconds. At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Ndjissipou extended his track and field resume by competing in the men's marathon. Though he had never experienced road running in a global stage, Ndjissipou managed to claim a ninety-seventh spot successfully in a vast field of a hundred athletes with a time of 2:35:55. Eight years after competing in his last Olympics, Ndjissipou qualified for his third Central African team, as a 31-year-old, in the men's marathon at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens by receiving a berth from the IAAF World Championships in Paris. He finished the race with a forty-fourth place time in 2:21:23, trailing behind Italian runner and gold medalist Stefano Baldini and Brazil's Vanderlei de Lima (whose race had been grappled and pushed off by Irish protester Cornelius Horan) by an estimation of ten seconds. Building his own milestone as a three-time Olympian, Ndjissipou was appointed by the National Olympic Committee (French: Comité National Olympique et Sportif Centrafricain) to carry the Central African flag in the opening ceremony."

He produced pencil art for the first issue of Detective Comics, which established DC Comics, and worked for a variety of other golden age companies such as Timely Comics, which became Marvel Comics, and Street & Smith, the publishers of Doc Savage. He was part of New York's Harlem Renaissance and subsequently moved to Greenwich Village where he was part of the artistic community and also developed property. He also created the short-lived comics series Blackstone, Master Magician in 1946 for EC Comics, which, despite its short run, was adapted into a radio drama series, Blackstone, the Magic Detective (1948-1950)."

He was placed by a random draw into a three-man preliminary pool against United States' Jamill Kelly and Moldova's two-time Olympian Ruslan Bodişteanu. Asgarov outclassed his first opponent Bodisteanu (7–3) at the start of the pool, before he was narrowly beaten by Kelly (2–3) in his subsequent match to generate a record of nine technical points, finishing only in second place and twelfth overall in the final standings."

Pery was the son of William Cecil Pery, 1st Baron Glentworth and his wife, Jane Walcott. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. He married Mary Alice, the daughter of Henry Ormsby of County Mayo, by his wife Mary Hartstonge, in 1783, and they had eight children. Mary Alice was the heiress of her uncle, Sir Henry Hartstonge, 3rd Baronet, who left her substantial property in the south-west of Ireland. She died in 1850. His eldest son and heir, Henry, Viscount Glentworth, predeceased him, and Limerick was succeeded in his titles by his grandson, William. One of Pery's daughters, Theodosia, married the Whig politician and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Monteagle of Brandon. Pery was elected to the Irish Parliament as the Member of Parliament for Limerick in 1786 and held the seat until 1794, when he inherited his father's barony and took his seat in the Irish House of Lords. As a politician, he was a vocal Unionist. He held the office of Keeper of the Signet and Privy Seal of Ireland between 1795 and 1797. In 1797, he was invested as a Privy Counsellor. Pery subsequently held the office of Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper of Ireland between 1797 and 1806. In 1800, he was created Viscount Limerick of the City of Limerick. Following the Act of Union 1800, he became a representative peer, sitting in the British House of Lords between 1801 and 1844. He was created Earl of Limerick in the Peerage of Ireland on 1 January 1803, in recognition of his vocal and persistent support for the Union. In addition, he was created Baron Foxford of Stackpole Court in the Peerage of Great Britain on 11 August 1815, giving him and his descendants a permanent seat in the House of Lords."

  "text" : "He was the son of Edward Davenant and nephew of John Davenant. Brief Lives describes the elder Edward Davenant as a learned London merchant, involved in the pilchard trade. Edward Davenant the younger was baptised at All Hallows, Bread Street on 25 April 1596 and educated at Merchant Taylors's School. Davenant then went to Queens' College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1613, and M.A. in 1617. He accompanied his uncle John to the Synod of Dort in 1618, and kept a diary. He was ordained in 1621. From 1615 to 1625 he was a Fellow of Queens', graduating B.D. in 1624. In 1629 he graduated D.D. In the aftermath of the Synod, John Davenant gave Cambridge lectures, significant for hypothetical universalism. They were published only in 1650, the delay being for political reasons; this came about because Edward Davenant sent them to James Ussher, who had Thomas Bedford, another Queens' graduate, edit them (in Latin). Davenant held incumbencies at Poulshot, North Moreton and Gillingham, Dorset. He was Treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral from 1634. At Gillingham, he pursued mathematical researches, and took pupils, who included John Aubrey. Aubrey recorded that Davenant was unwilling to publish on mathematics, preferring to keep his interest private. His algebra problems for his daughter Anne have survived in Aubrey's copy. Aubrey later took these problems to John Pell, for solution and commentary. What Davenant preferred was to circulate portions of his work in manuscript. According to John Walker in Sufferings of the Clergy, Davenant suffered sequestration at Gillingham during the First English Civil War, when his family numbered seven sons and five daughters, being replaced by Thomas Andrews. Writing to Ussher in 1646, during these troubles, Davenant introduced mathematical topics. Davenant died on 17 March 1679. A memorial slate is in his parish church at Gillingham."

  "text" : "Edmund Crosby Quiggin (23 August 1875 – 4 January 1920) was a British linguist and scholar. Born in Cheadle, Staffordshire, he was educated at Kingswood School in Bath. In 1893 he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge University, to read Modern and Medieval Languages. He graduated with first-class honours. The fellows of Caius included the lawyer and legal historian Charles Henry Monro, who spoke Irish and encouraged Quiggin to study in this area. In October 1898, Quiggin was appointed English Lector at the University of Greifswald, where he completed his doctorate, Die lautliche Geltung der vortonigen Wörter und Silben in der Book of Leinster Version der Tain bo Cualnge ('The phonetic quality of pre-stress words and syllables in the Book of Leinster version of the Táin Bó Cúailnge '). In 1901, Quiggin returned to Cambridge and between June 1903 and January 1906 went on to undertake fieldwork on Ulster Irish in County Donegal, resulting in the book A Dialect of Donegal. In 1907, Quiggin married numismatologist and archeologist Alison Hingston Quiggin, author of A Survey of Primitive Money and other works In 1909 Caius College used a bequest of Charles Henry Monro to create the Monro Lectureship in Celtic for him, the first of its kind and one of the forces which fed into the creation of the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic. (The department has, since 1993, commemorated Quiggin through the Quiggin Memorial Lecture, in which series the fullest biography of Quiggin so far has been published.) Quiggin's next publication was his Prolegomena to the Study of the Later Irish Bards, 1200–1500. However, with the outbreak of the First World War, Quiggin found himself in war service from 1915 to 1919, first in Boulogne and then in the Admiralty's Intelligence Division. In 1919 he returned to work and study at Cambridge, but died from ill health on 4 January 1920 in Warlingham."

  "text" : "Eli Harvey (September 23, 1860 – February 10, 1957) was an American sculptor, painter and animalier. Harvey was born in Ogden, Ohio, a Quaker community in Clinton County, to William P. and Nancy M. Harvey. He attended art school in the Cincinnati Art Academy where he studied painting with Thomas Satterwhite Noble and sculpture with Louis Rebisso. In 1889 he moved to Paris where he continued his studies, with Lefebvre, Constant, Doucet and finally Frémiet. In 1897 he began exhibiting sculptures of animals at paris salons and continued doing so until returning to the United States in 1900, by which time he was firmly committed to animal sculpture. His work was exhibited at both the Pan-American Exposition (Buffalo, New York, 1900) and at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (Saint Louis, Missouri, 1904) and a decade later at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition (San Francisco, California, 1915). Harvey also produced architectural sculpture for the lion house at the New York Zoological Park and two lions for the Eaton family mausoleum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Harvey's most popular work was a life-sized elk produced for the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and used at their buildings and in cemeteries around the United States. His home is included on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Clinton County, Ohio."

In 1895 he obtained his doctorate from the University of Munich, where he was a student of Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer. Afterwards, he was an assistant to Wilhelm Roux at the institute of anatomy in Halle, followed by work at the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn in Naples (1897–98). In 1899 he became an assistant to Otto Bollinger at the institute of pathology in Munich. From 1900 to 1904, he served as prosector at the Städtisches Krankenhaus rechts der Isar. In 1904, he succeeded Karl Weigert as director of the Senckenberg Institute of Pathological Anatomy in Frankfurt. He died four years later of a pulmonary hemorrhage caused by tuberculosis. He is remembered for development of the concept of \"hamartoma and choristoma\" in an attempt to describe the relationship between abnormal formation and tumor. In 1907 he founded the journal Frankfurter Zeitschrift für Pathologie."

  "text" : "Edward of Norfolk (c.1320 – before 9 August 1334), was the only son of Thomas of Brotherton, and a grandson of Edward I.

His mother was Alice Hales (d. in or before 1330), daughter of Sir Roger Hales of Hales Hall in Loddon in Roughton, Norfolk, by his wife, Alice. He had two sisters: \n* Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, who married firstly John Segrave, 4th Baron Segrave, by whom she had two sons and two daughters, and secondly Sir Walter Manny. \n* Alice of Norfolk (d. 30 January 1352), who married, before 29 August 1338, Sir Edward de Montagu (d. 14 July 1361), by whom she had a son and two daughters. Shortly after 29 May 1328, at Hereford, Edward of Norfolk married Beatrice de Mortimer, daughter of Roger de Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, by Joan de Joinville (d.1356), daughter and coheiress of Sir Peter de Joinville. The occasion was a double wedding at which the bride's sister, Agnes Mortimer, married Laurence Hastings, later 1st Earl of Pembroke. The celebrations were accompanied by a magnificent tournament, and were attended by Edward III and his mother, Isabella of France, who was by then the mistress of the bride's father, Roger de Mortimer. There was no issue of the marriage, and two years after the ceremony Roger de Mortimer was hanged at Tyburn as a common criminal. Edward of Norfolk died before 9 August 1334, predeceasing his father. His widow married, before 13 September 1337, Sir Thomas de Brewes (d. 9 or 16 June 1361), son and heir of Sir Peter de Brewes of Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and his wife Agnes de Clifford, by whom she had three sons and three daughters. After the death of Thomas of Brotherton about 20 September 1338, Edward of Norfolk's elder sister, Margaret, succeeded to the earldom of Norfolk."

She was a favorite of the Swedish Queen, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark. She was active as a poet at the royal court and was given much attention by her contemporaries. She participated at the amateur theatre of the royal court encouraged by the queen, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark. In the winter of 1683-84, a group of female courtiers performed the Swedish premier of Iphigénie by Racine at court. In the play, Johanna Eleonora De la Gardie acted in the part of Iphigenie, Amalia Königsmarck as Achilles, Aurora Königsmarck as Clitemnestre, Augusta Wrangel as Agamemnon, and Ebba Maria De la Gardie as Eriphile.  This is regarded as a significant event as the first play performed by an all female cast in Sweden, as an introduction of French Classicism in Sweden."

LaPlante's ancestor biographies \"have been praised as reminiscent of a more celebratory Nathaniel Hawthorne\", according to the Boston Book Festival. In the anthology BOSTON, which includes the preface to LaPlante's AMERICAN JEZEBEL, Shaun O'Connell observed, \"Just as Nathaniel Hawthorne dug into the dark history of his ancestry, which reached back both to the original Boston settlement of the 1630s and the Salem Witch Trials of the 1690s, so too did LaPlante trace family members who were rooted in the same eras... Hawthorne took shame upon himself for the misdeeds of his Puritan ancestors, and LaPlante offers praise for her forebears who testified against Puritan repression. As her prefaces to these biographies, a kind of spiritual autobiography, show, Anne Hutchinson and Samuel Sewall were not the dark Puritans many imagined them to be. They remain living presences, even models of rectitude, into the twenty-first century.\" LaPlante is a first cousin, four generations removed, of Louisa May Alcott. She collected and edited the private papers of her great great great great-aunt Abigail May Alcott, the abolitionist and suffragist who was Louisa's mother and mentor. She graduated from Princeton University and received a masters in education from Harvard University."

This record drew attention and was positively welcomed by the public which encouraged the artist to produce his first full album. Zenjabil v2.0 was released in 2011. More mature and more committed, Moh surrounded himself by quality musicians: Jean-Michel Franciette on drums, Salah Boutamine on bass, Vincent Raymond on trumpet, Krimo Yahioune on Guitar, Amine Acyl and Valery Pellegrini on percussions, arrangements and sound engineering. In June 2013, Moh has authored and recorded the Music of the play \"Classic Coiffure\" at the Auguste Théâtre (Paris, France), staged and produced by Sylvie Mandier.

  "text" : "Emilie Charlotta Petersen, née Eckert (15 July 1780, Hamburg - 10 January 1859, Kärda), known as Mormor på Herrestad (The Herrestad Grandmother), was a Swedish landowner and philanthropist. She was a pioneer within the sewing society in Sweden, as well as an internationally known philanthropist. Emilie Petersen was the daughter of the councilor Christian Eckert and married the wealthy merchant Johan Philip Petersen in 1800 in Hamburg. The couple emigrated to Sweden when Hamburg was taken by Napoleon in 1806, and in 1813, they bought the manor Herrestad. Emilie Petersen supported the Swedish Missionary Society from 1835, and from 1838, she regularly arranged religious sewing meetings, which are regarded to have introduced the sewing society in Sweden. During the hunger periods in the 1830s when the crops failed, Emilie Petersen arranged, in collaboration with the authorities, the Fruntimmersföreningen i Kärda (The Kärda Women's Society), a society which provided work for poor women within the parish with her estate in the center of the organisation. The principle of the society was economical funds given to the poor upon religious humanitarian grounds in exchange for workforce. The society gradually expanded to surrounding parishes: it became famous and received economic support both nationally and internationally. She also held an orphanage for poor orphans, which gave her the name Mormor på Herrestad (The Herrestad Grandmother)."

Soon afterwards, he obtained his habilitation in medicine, becoming an associate professor in 1748. At Halle, he gave lectures on theoretical subjects in the fields of pathology, physiology and pharmacology, later giving clinical lectures on diseases of the eye and childhood maladies. In 1758 he was appointed professor of theoretical medicine at the University of Jena. During the following year, he became a professor of chemistry and clinical medicine at Jena, a position he held until his death in 1802. As a physician, he was a proponent of humoral pathology and the doctrine of vitalism. He was a follower of Leibniz' concept of monadism, reportedly seeking solutions to medical problems based on the philosophic viewpoints of Gottfried Leibniz."

  "text" : "Eamon Dunne was a major Irish organised crime figure from Finglas, North Dublin. He led a gang based in Finglas, Cabra, and Ballymun, who were involved in drug dealing, armed robbery, extortion and murder. He took control of the gang after the murder of crime boss Martin \"Marlo\" Hyland, who was shot dead in December 2006, and Gardaí suspect that Dunne, who was one of Hyland's closest associates, drove the getaway car for the killers. Dunne was linked to 17 gangland murders over the next three years, as he consolidated his position by having rivals and suspected Garda informers killed. Dunne's increasing paranoia and unstable behaviour eventually led to his own gang members turning against him and they conspired with others to have him killed. Gardaí believe a major Irish drug trafficker based in Spain, who supplied Dunne's gang with drugs and a veteran crime boss based in North Dublin, who acted as a mentor to Dunne, were angry at Dunne for bringing too much Garda attention to gangland. Together with some of Dunne's closest associates they are suspected of organising his murder and of hiring a gang of young criminals from the north inner city to actually carry out the hit.Thirty-four-year-old Dunne was murdered as he attended a friend's birthday party at a pub in Cabra on 23 April 2010. Two masked gunmen entered and shot him several times in the head and body, in front of his seventeen-year-old daughter, before escaping in a waiting car. Despite his bodyguard and a number of close associates being present, nobody made any attempt to prevent the murder. At the time of his death, Dunne was on bail and awaiting trial in connection with a €900,000 robbery of a cash-in-transit van in Celbridge in 2007. No one has been convicted of his murder. Dunne is survived by many relatives in Ireland and the United States, including his cousin Kevin Dunne, a suspected hitman who is well known in the criminal world and is believed to be as ruthless as Eamon. Victims While not pulling the trigger himself, Dunne was suspected of ordering at least a dozen gangland murders in the years before his death. The victims included: \n* John Paul Joyce (30), a drug trafficker, shot dead and body dumped near Dublin Airport in January 2010. \n* David Thomas (43), shot dead in Finglas in October 2009. \n* Paul Smyth (34), from Finglas, killed and dumped in Balbriggan, June 2009. \n* Michael Murray (41), shot dead in Finglas, March 2009. \n* Graham McNally (34), formerly a close associate, shot dead in Finglas, January 2009. \n* Michael 'Roly' Cronin (35), a major drug dealer, and James Maloney (26), his driver, shot dead in Dublin city centre, January 2009. \n* Paul 'Farmer' Martin (30), a convicted bank robber, shot dead at a pub in Finglas, August 2008. \n* Trevor Walsh (33), shot dead at Kippure Park, Finglas, two days after he was released from prison, in July 2008. \n* John Daly (27), shot dead as he sat in a taxi in Finglas, October 2007, two months after his release from prison, where he served a nine-year sentence for armed robbery."

  "text" : "Elart von Collani (born April 1, 1944, Lodz) is a German mathematician and stochastician who introduced a novel approach to science, which does not aim at explaining the universe, but at solving human problems. What are the characteristic features of future developments and how can they be described without making unrealistic assumptions? Von Collani's answer is that the future outcome of any development does not exist at the beginning, since many different outcomes are possible, and that therefore it cannot be predicted in principle. He concludes that the resulting uncertainty about the future outcome is the most striking feature of any real process and that this uncertainty leads to most of the problems humans are faced with. The variability of outcomes generates not only uncertainty but also the dynamics of the development of the universe. According to von Collani, any model of a real process, which does not include the omnipresent uncertainty, gives a wrong picture of reality and must almost necessarily lead to wrong decisions."

Erekle was married to a certain Tamar, with no known issue. Erekle was a son of Archil, a grandson of King Constantine II of Georgia. Traditional genealogies such as that by Cyril Toumanoff omit Erekle's tenure as Prince of Mukhrani, instead placing a continuous rule of his cousin, Teimuraz I from 1580 to 1625. During Archil's captivity in Iran, Erekle lived with his cousins from the ruling Jaqeli family in the Principality of Samtskhe and fought on their side against the Shalikashvili-led aristocratic revolt in Samtskhe from 1576 to 1578. In May 1578, Erekle returned to the Kingdom of Kartli and provided support to Queen Nestan-Darejan, a consort of his exiled cousin, King Simon I of Kartli, who stayed at Surami. Soon, as the Ottoman army under Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha marched into the Georgian lands in August 1578, Erekle found himself in the heat of another war as an energetic and locally successful commander."

Between 1919-1925 he studied at Tartu Teacher's College at Tartu University, where he met Eduard Tubin, and he also worked for some time as a school teacher. He was not a particularly prolific composer, composing mainly orchestral and ensemble works and choral music. He was however much appreciated during his lifetime, and received awards and acclaim for several of his works. He also worked as a conductor, leading the Tartu Women's Singing Society’s Women's Choir between 1930 and 1934, as well as a teacher of music theory at Tartu Higher School of Music. In addition, he was himself a practising violinist. A number of his works such as the opera Oath Redeemed (Estonian: Lunastatud vanne) and the choral work The Return Home (Estonian: Kojuminek) have been lost, although the majority of his work has survived, and is valued in museums in Estonia today. The Eduard Tubin Museum of Alatskivi Castle contains exhibits related to him and his fellow students under Heino Eller, known as the \"Tartu school\", such as Eduard Tubin, Alfred Karindi, Olav Roots and Karl Leichter."

  "text" : "Emmanuel Kipkemei Bett (born 29 March 1985) is a Kenyan long-distance runner who competes in track and road running events. He has a 10,000 metres personal best of 26:51.16 minutes, which was the fastest time in the world in the 2012 season. He was a late-comer to the elite level of running and made his first professional appearances in 2010. Competing in Brazil, he finished second at the Rio de Janeiro half marathon, fifth at the São Paulo 15K and was runner-up at the Santos 10K. He competed in Europe for the first time in 2011 and made his breakthrough in the 10,000 metres track event. He placed fourth at the high profile Memorial Van Damme and set a best of 26:51.95 minutes. This ranked him in the top ten that year. He ended the year with a win at the prestigious Zatopek 10 race in Melbourne. In 2012 he placed fourth in the 10,000 m Kenyan trial race at the Prefontaine Classic, running a time of 27:07.90 minutes. After setting a 5000 metres best of 13:08.35 minutes at the Bislett Games, he also ran the Kenyan trial race over that distance, but in fifth place he was not selected for the Kenyan Olympic team. Despite this, he won at the Memorial Van Damme meeting and his time of 26:51.16 was a personal best and the fastest 10,000 m by any athlete that year. He also ran a personal best of 60:56 minutes at the Great North Run, taking fifth place at the half marathon, and was the winner at the Cross Internacional de Soria. He retained his Zatopek 10 title that December. He opened 2013 on the cross country circuit and was runner-up at the Cross Internacional de Itálica and the Cross Internacional Juan Muguerza. He was in the top ten of the World's Best 10K and the 10,000 m at the Prefontaine Classic, then placed second at the Lilac Bloomsday Run. He attempted to gain selection for the 2013 World Championships in Athletics, but was again out of the running with a fourth-place finish at the 10,000 m Kenyan trials. In October he was second only to Haile Gebrselassie at the Great Scottish Run and topped the podium at the Great South Run 10-mile race, seeing off a challenge from defending champion Stephen Mokoka."

  "text" : "Elton Clark Pody (December 1, 1938 – March 27, 2011) was from 1982 to 1990 the mayor of Ruston in Lincoln Parish in North Louisiana and thereafter the 20-year president of the Central Louisiana Chamber of Commerce based in Alexandria, Louisiana. Pody was the son of Tom Henry Pody (1910-2002) and the former Fannie Mae Bearden (1915-2001) of Farmerville in Union Parish. He spent the majority of his life in the Ruston/Farmerville area. He graduated from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. A Republican, he was defeated on October 6, 1990 for a third term as mayor of Ruston by the Democrat Hilda Taylor Perritt, a former high school teacher. Pody polled 2,633 votes (42.2 percent) to Perritt's 3,612 (57.8 percent). In a civic club address in 1989 in Minden in Webster Parish, Pody called for municipalities to work together and declared local government the most cost-effective: \"I believe local government is very important because it provides so much service on a daily basis.\" Pody said that the average family then paid $250 annually to local government but $1,700 to the state, and $4,200 to the U.S. government; therefore he considered the local contribution to more effective on a per-capita basis. After his mayoral tenure ended, Pody moved to Alexandria to take the top position with the Chamber of Commerce. Shortly before his death, Pody had announced that he would retire from the chamber at the end of 2011. Pody often said, \"Every man needs two things, God and a job\", as he devoted much of his pursuits in recent decades to job creation. He attended Grace Presbyterian Church in Alexandria. To everyone he used the parting comment \"Be Blessed\". Pody died at his home in Alexandria at the age of seventy-two. Services were held at Calvary Baptist Church in Alexandria. He is interred at the Mineral Springs Baptist Church Cemetery in Dubach in Lincoln Parish. From his marriage of nearly fifty years to the former Sherry Williamson (born 1943) of Alexandria, came three sons, Stanton Clark \"Stan\" Pody (born 1964) and wife Mary of Ruston, Shawn A. Pody (born 1966) and wife Kelly of Lebanon, Tennessee, Chad Patrick Pody (born 1969) and wife Angie of Ruston, and one daughter, Sondra Pody Haygood (born 1970) and husband James Gregory Haygood (born 1966) of Wichita, Kansas. He had a surviving sister, Lola Faye Pody Silmon (born 1932) of Downsville, Louisiana, and eleven grandchildren. Pody's memory is honored by the Louisiana State University at Alexandria Foundation through the \"Elton C. Pody Scholarship Fund\"."

  "text" : "Sir Edmund Vivian Gabriel, CSI, CMG, CVO, CBE, VD, FSA was a British civil servant, army officer, courtier and art collector. Edmund Vivian Gabriel was born on 28 March 1875. Educated at Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge (B.A., 1896), he entered the Indian Civil Service in 1897 and the Indian Political Service in 1913. In his early years he served as attaché to the 1903 Coronation Durbar, Political Advisor to Chandra Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, Prime Minister of Nepal (1907), Resident of Western Rajputana States (1908), and Chief Secretary, North-West Frontier Province (1910). During the First World War he was first assigned to the Imperial General Staff, War Office, in London, where he was closely associated with Lord Kitchener, then Secretary of State for War. He subsequently joined the British Military Mission with the Italian Royal Army, as the head of the intelligence section, and later served as liaison officer to the naval forces in the Aegean Sea (British Aegean Squadron). In 1917 he was deployed to Cairo and assigned to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. On 11 December he entered Jerusalem with General Edmund Allenby and was appointed financial advisor and assistant administrator of Palestine (then known as Occupied Enemy Territory Administration South). In 1919 he was however asked to resign in reason of his pro-Arab views. After the war he moved to Britain and maintained his services with the Territorial Army, reaching the rank of colonel. His London residence was 40, Wilton Crescent. On 11 December 1924 he married Mabel McAfee, an American citizen, in a celebration held at Saint Thomas Church in New York City. In 1925 he was appointed to King George V's household as a Gentleman Usher in Ordinary, a title he maintained until his death. In the 1937 Coronation Honours he was knighted by King George VI. During the Second World War he was a member of the British Air Commission to the United States of America. Edmund Vivian Gabriel descended from the Gabrielli, a noble Italian family from Gubbio, a branch of which had settled in England in the 17th century. He maintained there a residence at 10, via Ducale, was honorary curator of the local Palazzo Ducale, and supported the restoration of local artifacts and buildings. In the 1920s he decided to bequeath the collection of art he had gathered during his stay in Asia to the municipality of Gubbio: the Vivian Gabriel Oriental Collection of Tibetan, Nepalese, Chinese and Indian Art is today exposed in the Palazzo dei Consoli in the Umbrian hilltown. For this and his services during the war he was appointed by King Victor Emmanuel III Officer, Order of the Crown of Italy, and Officer, Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. He also was a Knight of Justice of the Venerable Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. He died in Antigua, Leeward Islands, British West Indies on 13 February 1950, at the residency of the Governor, the 2nd Earl Baldwin. His portrait by John Newman Holroyd is exposed at the Museum of the Order of St John in London."

  "text" : "Ethel Barringer (24 July 1883 – 30 May 1925) was a South Australian artist who excelled in various media but was particularly known for her etchings.. Ethel was a daughter of Leonard Barringer (ca 1844 – 11 August 1895) and his wife Fanny, née Page (ca.1857 – 6 July 1920). She was educated at the Advanced School for Girls under Miss Rees George, and was a student of Hans Heysen and Mary Packer Harris at the SA School of Arts and Crafts. She studied in London for several years and took courses in enamelling, jewellery designing, life work, and etching at the St John's Wood Art School and the Sir John Cass Technical School. On her return to Adelaide she set up a studio of her own in Flinders Street, but gave it up when she gained an appointment as assistant teacher at the School of Arts and Crafts on North Terrace. She died suddenly of a heart attack in Blackwood where she had been teaching for four years, and was popular with both fellow-teachers and students. Her death came as a shock to members of the staff, who had been with her on the Saturday morning, when she was in excellent spirits, having just been congratulated on her work at an exhibition of the Women Painter-Etchers Society in Sydney."

From the age of 18, he was associated with the botanical garden in the city of Avignon. He performed extensive studies of flora native to Corsica and in the environs of Mont Ventoux. During his lifetime, he amassed an herbarium of 300,000 specimens. In the fields of conchology and palaeontology, he conducted collecting expeditions to the Pyrenees, Catalonia and Italy. The natural history museum, Musée Requien, in Avignon is named in his honor. He is the taxonomic authority of a monotypic plant genus Helxine, now treated as a synonym of Soleirolia, in the nettle family Urticaceae. The genera Requienella (author Jean-Henri Fabre) and Requienia (author Augustin Pyramus de Candolle) are named after him, as are plants with the specific and subspecific epithets of requienii. The World Register of Marine Species lists 57 marine species names by Requien, most of which have become synonyms."

It was not until 2011 that he started racing at the top level in European marathons. That year saw him win the Antwerp Marathon in a course record time of 2:11:15 hours. He matched that time to win the Košice Peace Marathon in October. The following year he was tenth at the Barcelona Marathon (2:12:15), but was much improved on his return to Košice: although he failed to defend his title and ended the race in fourth, he set a new lifetime best of 2:07:51 hours for the distance. In his first race of 2013 he placed third at the Mumbai Marathon with a run of 2:10:03 hours. The Porto Half Marathon saw him finish as runner-up in a personal best of 1:02:19 hours. This prepared him for the Frankfurt Marathon in October, where he was a comfortable third in a time of 2:07:34 hours – another personal best."

Klein developed a topical treatment for skin cancer with 5-fluorouracil, developed one of the first effective treatments for Kaposi’s sarcoma, and was amongst the first to clinically explore the use of lymphocytes to help cancer patients, earning him the nickname \"the Father of Immunotherapy.\" He won the 1972 Lasker Award. Klein developed a technique that allowed the separation of whole human blood into its component parts of plasma, platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells, greatly increasing the efficiency of the entire transfusion process; now three people could benefit from a single donor instead of one, with red blood cells used for anemic individuals, platelets for cancer patients, and plasma for those with decreased blood volume. Klein's results were published in both the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of Pediatrics and earned him the first prize for originality of research from the International Society for Hematology in 1956."
