  "text" : "Frederick R. Leach was a nineteenth-century English master decorator, mural and stained glass painter based in Cambridge. He worked with the architects George Frederick Bodley and George Gilbert Scott Junior and the designer William Morris on a number of high Victorian churches and college interiors. With Bodley, these included the roof and organ loft of St Botolph's Church, Cambridge, the decoration of the dining hall ceiling of Queens' College and All Saints, Cambridge, where he worked as a subcontractor for William Morris. He also carried out Morris's redesign for the roof of the Oxford Union in 1875 and the ceiling of Jesus College in 1866–1867. In 1866 Leach was contracted by William Beaumont to paint the organ pipes and front during the restoration of St Michael's, Cambridge, and, after Beaumont's death, by George Gilbert Scott Junior for the reredos over a two-year period from 1872 to 1874 at a fee of £203-16-2. In 1874, Leach also painted the roof, without payment, as a thanks offering to God. He founded the firm FR Leach and Sons, responsible among other things for the windows of St Peter's, Barton. Leach painted the sundial of Queen's College Cambridge in 1864 and his firm was to repaint it in 1911."

He created series of paintings exploring historical themes: Anarchy, the wreck of the Titanic, alchemy and Mozart, the French Revolution and its victims, Yekaterinburg and the murder of Nicholas II and his family. His last series offered a dark reading of Pinocchio, which he considered one of the three or four greatest Italian novels."

The Ph.D. dissertation addressed the following topics: ion distributions in molten salts, the structure of electrical double layers at electrodes in concentrated salt solutions, the partition functions for quantum fluids, and a particle-size-coupling formalism for equilibrium distribution functions. in In September 1959 he joined the Research Area of Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ. Following the U.S. Justice Department's divestiture order for Bell Labs, Stillinger was transferred to a Lucent Technologies in 1996, where he experienced what he calls \"impatient attitude toward basic research\", and later to Lucent's spinoff, Agere Systems, where his employment was terminated in 2001. Since late 1996 Stillinger entered into a scientific collaboration with Princeton University."

He was a close associate of the Later Tang's second emperor Li Siyuan, serving three terms as Li Siyuan's chief of staff (Shumishi), and subsequently continued to serve as a general. After the Later Tang's final emperor Li Congke (Li Siyuan's adoptive son) was overthrown by Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang, who founded Later Jin, Fan initially formally submitted, but later rebelled against Shi. His rebellion, however, was not successful, and after Shi promised to spare him, he surrendered. He was, nevertheless, later killed by Shi's general Yang Guangyuan, probably with Shi's implicit, if not explicit, approval."

  "text" : "Filadelfo Simi (February 11, 1849 in Versilia – January 5, 1923 in Florence) was an Italian painter and sculptor. He was born in Versilia in Tuscany, and resident in Florence. He first attended the School of Fine Arts at Seravezza, but then from 1869 to 1873 attended the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence. One patron during these years was the engineer Angiolo Vegni. At the 1873 Promotrice, he exhibited a La giovinezza dell’Alfieri. From 1874 to 1878, he lived mainly in Paris, where he frequented the studio of Jean-Léon Gérôme. During 1876, he traveled through Spain with the painter Alden Weir. In 1878, at the Exposition Artistique of the Paris Salon, he exhibited a Forest of Fontainbleau. He also paints the realistic Portrait of Old Lady, now found in the Galleria d’Arte Moderna in the Palazzo Pitti. He returns to Italy and participated in exhibitions in Florence. In 1881, he displays a canvas titled The Phtisic Woman (La Tisica; depicting a woman afflicted with tuberculosis). In 1883, he was nominated a Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy; he became Honorary Academic In Florence (1884), Bologna (1888) and the Brera Academy in Milan (1895). In 1886, he opened a school for artists. In 1888 he became professor of the Scuola del Nudo at the Florentine Academy. He was not prolific, and dedicated himself to a few paintings per year. At the 1885 Promotrice of Florence, he exhibited a Studio dal vero, and at 1887 at the Venetian Exposizione Nazionale Artistica, he had a painting titled: l'l riflesso, and a Portrait of his parents. The former painting would later be awarded a gold medal at an 1888 Munich Exhibition and in 1893 at Florentine Annual Exposition of Fine Arts, a grand prize worth 5000 Lire. In Bologna in 1888, among the four canvases exhibited were: Riposo, San Girolamo, and Neruccia and Jettatura. At the 1889 Universal Exhibition in Paris, his dyptich was awarded a bronze medal. He also was a sculptor, sending in 1908 a large marble statue commissioned for a chapel in Halifax, Canada by the rector of the Accademia Monte San Vincenzo. That same year, he sent a Monument of Garibaldi to the Italian Community of Porto Alegre. Simi's daughter Nerina Simi (1890–1987) was a prominent art teacher in Florence."

Stavely (1894-1976) was a researcher at the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company who in 1953, while investigating the reaction of butyl lithium on butadiene discovered that polymerization of isoprene with metallic lithium produced polyisoprene (dubbed \"coral rubber\" because of its appearance) with a high cis content.High cis content is associated with enhanced strain crystallization, important during WWII because other synthetics did not exhibit the crystallization effect. In 1950, Stavely served as chairman of the American Chemical Society Rubber Division. In 1972, Stavely received the Charles Goodyear Medal in recognition of this discovery."

He was born in Edgware. Salvat was a magazine designer in London and the Amateur Athletics Association three mile champion before competing in international events, running for Great Britain against France in the 5,000m at White City and in the Olympics later that year. He was a member of Finchley Harriers, now Hillingdon Athletic Club, in northwest London. Athletics agent Eric Shirley Jr, whose father Eric Shirley was Salvat's training partner, said: \"He was an amazing man with an amazing amount of charisma. His pre-race diet, two hours before he competed, even at the very highest international level, would be a pie and a pint. It's not unknown for him to start a race with a brandy glass in his hand, hand it over to someone, and even have a cigar waiting for him at the end.\" Salvat died in poverty in Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex on 24 April 2013. Nobody claimed his body after his death and he would have had a pauper's funeral, but pubs and businesses in Hurstpierpoint, as well as his former athletics club, raised money for a funeral and a wake."

  "text" : "Forbes Benignus Winslow DCL, FRCP Edin., MRCP, MRCS, MD, (10 August 1810–3 March 1874) was a British psychiatrist, author and an authority on lunacy during the Victorian era. Winslow was the ninth son of Thomas Winslow (1772–1815), a Captain in the 47th Regiment of Foot, and his wife, Mary (née Forbes) (1774–1854). He was born at Pentonville in August 1810. The family lost their American property in the American War of Independence and came to England. After education in Scotland, in 1820 aged 10 Forbes Winslow travelled to New York where he continued his education before returning to Britain to study medicine. After education at University College, London, and at the Middlesex Hospital, where he was a pupil of Sir Charles Bell, he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1835, and graduated MD at the University of Aberdeen in 1849. He had to pay the expenses of his own medical education, and did so by acting as a reporter for The Times in the Gallery of the House of Commons, and by writing small manuals for students on osteology, and on practical midwifery. In 1839 he published anonymously Physic and Physicians, in two volumes, a collection of miscellaneous anecdotes about physicians and surgeons; and in 1840 The Anatomy of Suicide, an endeavour to demonstrate that most suicides are not criminal, but are victims of mental disease. This was followed in 1843 by The Plea of Insanity in Criminal Cases, and in 1845 by The Incubation of Insanity. He was now regarded by the public as an authority in cases of insanity, and in 1847 opened two private lunatic asylums at Hammersmith, where he employed the humane method of treating lunatics which is now universal, but was then regarded as on its trial. He founded the Quarterly Journal of Psychological Medicine in 1848, and continued it for sixteen years. He became FRCP Edin. in 1850 and MRCP in 1859. When the Earl of Derby was installed as Chancellor of the University of Oxford, the honorary degree of DCL was conferred on Winslow on 9 June 1853. With Dr. Tyler Smith and Dr. James Yearsley he founded the Medical Directory. He continued to write numerous papers on insanity and on its relation to the laws, and in 1860 published On the Obscure Diseases of the Brain and Mind, a work containing many interesting cases. In 1865, after recovering from a serious illness, he wrote Light and its Influence and a short essay On Uncontrollable Drunkenness. He was examined before a committee of the House of Commons in 1872 on this subject. The frequent establishment of the plea of insanity in criminal cases was largely due to his influence, and he was called as a witness in many celebrated trials. He died at Brighton on 3 March 1874, and was buried in the family vault at Epping. The Medical Circular for 16 March 1853 contains his portrait, engraved from a daguerreotype. In 1841 he married Susannah Holt (1811–1883). His eldest son, the Revd Forbes Edward Winslow, was vicar of Epping. His second son, Lyttelton Stewart Forbes Winslow, graduated in medicine and, like his father, became a noted psychiatrist. He became famous for his involvement in the Jack the Ripper and Georgina Weldon cases. His daughter, Susanna Frances, married the humorist Arthur William à Beckett. Another daughter was Contance Winslow (1850-1925)."

She married the Parliamentary Ombudsman Casper Ehrenborg in 1811 and became the mother of the writer Betty Ehrenborg and Ulla Bring. She suffered from her lack of education, but educated herself by reading, and wished, and was able to pass on her knowledge. In 1824, she became a widow and had to support herself and her five children alone. At this point, she became interested in The New Church and the ideas of Swedenborg. She belonged to the Geijer literary circle in Uppsala and published several religious works, children stories, travel descriptions and other works. She was regarded as one of the leading supporters of The New Church in Sweden."

His name is associated with \"Siegert's sign\", defined as shortness and inward curvature of the terminal phalanges of the little fingers in Down's syndrome. In 1889 he received his medical doctorate form the University of Strassburg, subsequently serving as a secondary physician in Mödling near Vienna. Afterwards, he worked as an assistant under Friedrich Wilhelm Zahn at the institute of pathology in Geneva, and as an assistant to Oswald Kohts at the university children's clinic in Strassburg. While at Strassburg, he founded a Säuglingsfürsorge (an infant care institution) and a Säuglingsheilstatt (nursing home for infants). In 1904, he was appointed an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Halle, soon afterwards relocating to Munich as chair of pediatrics at the academy of practical medicine. In 1919 he moved to the University of Cologne as a professor of pediatrics. Siegert is remembered for his work with infectious diseases, especially diphtheria. He was particularly interested in the inheritability of rickets as well as the nutritional needs of children (protein requirements)."

  "text" : "Francis Thomas-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Earl of Kerry (9 September 1740 – 4 July 1818) was an Irish peer: he was the heir to a great inheritance, but his extravagance led to the loss of all his Irish estates. He was the only son of William Fitzmaurice, 2nd Earl of Kerry, and Lady Gertrude Lambart, daughter of Richard Lambart, 4th Earl of Cavan and Margaret Trant. His father died when he was only seven and he became a Ward in Chancery. He was educated at the University of Dublin where he took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1758 and Master of Arts in 1759. In 1768 he married Anastasia Daly, younger daughter and co-heiress of Peter Daly of Queensbury, County Galway : she obtained a divorce by Act of Parliament from her first husband (who was also her cousin), Charles Daly of Loughrea, in order to marry Lord Kerry. The marriage caused much comment, most of it adverse: apart from the need to divorce her previous husband, a step which was still felt by many in polite society to be faintly scandalous, Anastasia was much older than her husband, socially she was not his equal, and she was a Roman Catholic. LIke her husband she was extravagant, and she was blamed by many for her husband's disastrous financial losses. Nonetheless the inscription which he had placed on her tomb in Westminster Abbey makes it clear that he never regretted marrying her: it states that for 31 years she made him the happiest of mankind, due to her \"charity, benevolence, truth, sincerity, meekness and simplicity\". Others who knew the couple took a more jaundiced view: Horace Walpole called Lord Kerry \"a simple young Irish peer that has married an elderly Irishwoman, who was divorced on his account, and wasted a vast estate on the idlest ostentation.\" The Earl's cousin and heir William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne wrote uncharitably that \"he fell in love with a married lady twenty years older than himself, the daughter of an eminent Roman Catholic lawyer, and she having obtained a divorce, married her- [she was] an extraordinarily vain person. Having their way to fight up into good society, and having no children, they sold every acre of land that had been in our family since Henry II's time\". Lady Kerry died on 9 April 1799. Her husband died in 1818 and was buried in the same tomb in Westminster Abbey. He had no children and the title became an additional title of the Marquess of Lansdowne, descendants of his uncle John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne."

  "text" : "Fritz Ernst Oppenheimer (1898–1968) was a German American lawyer. Being Jewish, he emigrated from Nazi Germany to the United States in 1940, but later returned as part of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force and helped draft denazification laws. Born in Berlin as son of lawyer Ernst Oppenheimer and Amalie Friedländer, Fritz Oppenheimer studied law at the Humboldt University of Berlin, the University of Freiburg, and the University of Breslau, after serving during World War I. He joined his father's law firm in 1925, practicing international law, and took over the firm after his father's death in 1929. After the Machtergreifung, it was increasingly difficult for Oppenheimer to work, even though he was allowed to continue practicing for being a World War I veteran. Finally, he decided to emigrate, first to London in 1937, then to New York City in 1940, where he joined Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. In 1943, he volunteered to join the United States Army, thereby becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, and eventually served as legal consultant to General Lucius D. Clay. He retired in 1957, and moved to Palo Alto, California. He died in an accident during a trip to East Africa."

  "text" : "Francis Underhill Macy (February 19, 1927 – January 20, 2009) was founder and co-director of the Center for Safe Energy between 1995 till his death in 2009. During this time Macy trained hundreds of activists in Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, and Kazakhstan to address the environmental legacy of the nuclear arms race and the Chernobyl disaster. Initiating scores of professional delegations and exchanges between Americans and their counterparts in the former Soviet Union in the areas of psychology, environment, and citizen organizing since 1983, Macy empowered the rise of non-governmental organizations – a strong contribution to the health of post-Soviet life. In 2005, he was awarded the Nuclear Free Future Lifetime Achievement Award. \"Between 1964 and 1972, he served as deputy Peace Corps director in India, country director in Tunisia and Nigeria and finally as director of all Peace Corps programs in Africa\". Macy “pioneered as a citizen ambassador linking Russians and Americans in shared concern for the environment, at a pivotal time when environmental activism was just emerging in the Soviet Union” and “led in the formation of permanent protection and restoration efforts, such as Earth Island’s Baikal Watch project,” says John Knox, co-executive director of Earth Island Institute. Earth Island’s founder, David Brower, was “particularly grateful for Macy’s leadership” in engaging him with Russia’s foremost environmental leaders. Macy complemented his organizational trainings with experiential teachings in Deep Ecology. He served as director of the Institute for Deep Ecology from 1995, and led transformational workshops around the world with his wife of 56 years, Joanna Macy, a leading Buddhist and systems theory teacher. Together they trained people to become leaders in the broader environmental movement."

  "text" : "Fred Goodwill (born 1874) was a British missionary stationed in Bangalore, British India between 1899 and 1924, serving as the Superintendent of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission, Bangalore and Kolar Gold Fields. He is acknowledged for working for the cause of education of native women in the Bangalore Cantonment. The Goodwills Girls School located in Fraser Town, Bangalore Cantonment is named after him. He was a scholar of the Tamil Language, and was also fluent in Canarese (Kannada) and Telagu (Telugu). Fred is acknowledged as an authority on Tamil Shaiva Literature, with authors quoting from his research. As one of the founding members of the Mythic Society, his published papers on the history of the Mysore State form the basis of history of the State, as we know it now. Fred Goodwill was a keen photographer and documented life in British India, especially life around the Bangalore Cantonment, with hundreds of photos. His photos are not only of churches and schools, but of ordinary people in India, with subjects such as butchers, tradesmen, travelling minstrels, friars, cooks, dhobhis, worshippers, and temples, monuments, etc. His pictures have recently evoked lot of interest in social media groups interested in Bangalore and Indian history. They were part of a group of photos exhibited at the Rangoli Metro Art Centre, Bangalore, in November 2013 and have appeared in many news articles on old Bangalore, and were also exhibited at the INTACH exhibition at Ulsoor. Many of his photos have been published in books published in British India and have also been published as Tucks India Series Postcards. Fred was the youngest child of farmers Thomas and Elizabeth Goodwill. His birth was registered in the first quarter of 1874 (Volume 9, p. 85) at Great Ouseburn. The family owned 56 acres of land and lived in the Main Street of Helperby. Fred's siblings were James (born 1857), Hannah (born 1859), Thomas (born 1860), Elizabeth (born 1868) and Pollie (born 1872)."

  "text" : "Franciszek Pinck, also Pink, and Ping, Bing or Byng (1733-27 May 1798) was a Polish sculptor and stucco artist.

The author of equestrian statue of King John III Sobieski on a bridge on the Royal Route, Warsaw, unveiled in 1788 on the occasion of 105th anniversary of the Battle of Vienna. This monument is considered the most important work of Pinck. Hammered mainly in stone, he produced busts and statues for early projects of the royal sculptor Andrzej Le Brun, adorning the royal estates of Ujazdów Castle, the Royal Castle, Warsaw, Bathrooms (garden and palace) and the palace in Kozienice. In the 1790s sculptural work orders from the king ceased, royal cash enveloped him even with the payment of 348 ducats (his monthly salary in 1779 was 30 ducats). Pinck ran into financial trouble, sending the king several requests for payment of debts and even asking Marcello Bacciarelli for an intercession, of which Bacciarelli eventually granted him. Pinck is the sculptor who performed many different types of work and was always in demand. He obtained as a result of the promise a payment of 900 ducats, but from then on he had to deal with finer sculptural works for private jobs. His son, Ferdinand (1761-1797), was a landscape painter. He died in Warsaw on May 27, 1798."

  "text" : "Friedrich Siegfried Buxbaum (23 September 1869, Vienna – 2 October 1948, London) was an Austrian cellist and long-serving member (and principal cello) of the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera, and member of the Rosé Quartet. His Jewish father Max Buxbaum was from Bohemia, and mother Rosa Wilharditz was a member of the IKG Wien. Buxbaum studied at the Vienna Conservatory from 1883–87, under the tutelage of Ferdinand Hellmesberger He played briefly in the Glasgow Symphony Orchestra in Scotland, was active as a soloist and a member of the Fitzner Quartet from 1893-1900, and then, on 1 October 1900, was accepted as a member of the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera, and also became a member of the Rosé Quartet. He later headed his own quartet. He was to participate in premieres of works by Johannes Brahms, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern. He was to serve as principal and solo cellist of the Vienna Philharmonic until 13 March 1938, when he and other Jewish members of the orchestra were dismissed. He and his family escaped Vienna for the UK in September 1938; he was granted permanent residency in December. In October 1946, the Vienna Philharmonic invited him to return to his seat as cello principal, from which, its correspondence said, “you were unlawfully driven away a few years ago,” asking Buxbaum, to “give us the opportunity to set right at least a small portion of the wrongs that were done to you.” His response began, “Dear friends, you can probably imagine what a joy it was for me to read your friendly and honoring invitation…. To work with this orchestra as long as humanly possible is a tempting task indeed, although it would be easier for me to make a decision if I had knowledge of the factual conditions concerning my position….” Buxbaum, was never to return, but the orchestra awarded him its highest honor, the Nicolai Silver Medal in 1947 when it was touring in Edinburgh."

Baumbach excelled as a player on the piano, guitar and mandolin; but he is known more through his compositions and writings than his performances. He was characterized as \"a man of scholarly and refined taste and great literary attainments.\" His musical education was thorough and his progress most rapid, for in 1778, at the age of twenty-five, he was conductor of the Hamburg opera orchestra and in 1782 he was appointed musical director of the theatre, Riga. He occupied this position for seven years, until 1789, at which date he resigned his conductorship to reside in Leipzig as musical composer, author and critic. His published compositions, which include sonatas for the pianoforte, instrumental trios, concertos, violin duos, songs with piano and guitar accompaniments and studies and solos for the guitar are \"all characterized by their noble and profound nature.\" His first publications, six sonatas for the piano, were published in Gotha in 1790. Baumbach's guitar compositions include: Sixteen studies as preludes, in all the major and minor keys, Twenty-four progressive pieces, Two airs and two romances as guitar solos, Six romances with variations for guitar solo, Russian air with variations, and a Rondo for guitar solo. These were published in Leipzig by Peters, Hofmeister and the Musical Industrial Agency. The latter part of his life he devoted almost solely to writing musical articles and criticisms. He was remembered in 1814 as \"the author of those interesting articles in the Kurz gefasstes Handworterbuch über die schonen Künste, which appeared in 1794.\""

In 1851 he moved to Santa Cruz, where he would remain for the next sixty years. He became known as a land developer and businessman. In 1869, he ran for the California State Assembly as an Independent. He served only one term, but continued to be involved in local and regional politics, often to the advantage of his own businesses. When he died in 1913, he owned a wide variety of business from lumberyards to hotels. His personal business empire increased the infrastructure and economic development of Santa Cruz."

  "text" : "Fatima Abou Gahas (Arabic: فاطمة علي ابو قحاص‎‎, Fāṭimah Abu 'alī qaḥāṣ) was a famous female Saudi artist from 'Asir Province. The style of painting that she is famous for is called \"nagash painting\", or a fresco wall painting in the majlis, or front parlour, of the traditional Asir home. \"Called 'nagash' in Arabic, the wall paintings were a mark of pride for a woman in her house.\" They are composed of various geometric items and images. Um Abdullah said: “The triangles in the paintings with the little trees are called 'banat' [girls], and she would name a triangle for each of us daughters, like all mothers did. It was fun.” Dr. Sharon Parker, an independent scholar and art historian who has spent decades studying Middle Eastern art, says: “These unusual paintings are linked to the work of other women in the region by virtue of their purpose—to enhance interior spaces—and by the use of geometric patterns to create a narrative reflecting their lives.” \"Fatima Abou Gahas, armed with brushes made of goat hair, was the only one of these famed majlis painters who lived to paint the walls of a modern home, that of her son-in-law Aam Torshi and her daughter, Salha. Fatima Abou Gahas’s mother, Amna, had also been a well-known painter, but Fatima, who was widowed young and had four little children, actually had to paint for a living. A few years before Fatima died, Aam Torshi asked her to teach her art to several women of different ages. The venue? A workshop in which the women painted the majlis of the modest home where he had been born. He has now made Qasr Bader, as the home is called, a private museum, and he still locks the door with the original key, about the size of his forearm. “She first drew with black paint to make the basic design, although on her own; unlike most, she didn’t need so many guidelines,” he says, noting that charcoal, rather than black paint, was used in the old days. “Then she put a black dot where color needed to go and the other women painted the color in. The women would come at around four p.m. and they would stay until the last call to prayer [in the early evening]. They finished in less than two weeks.” Normally a majlis takes one to two months to do, depending on the detail. Salha grew up hearing her mother referred to as a “genius.” Sitting in the modern majlis her mother painted, Salha can only say that Fatima Abou Gahas’s creativity “came from God.” “Her designs would just appear to her,” she recalls. “One time she was praying in my home, and afterwards she got up and told me that the prayer rug had given her an idea and she needed to borrow the rug.”"

  "text" : "Ferdinando de Cristofaro (1846 – 18 April 1890) was one of the most celebrated mandolin virtuosi of the late 19th Century. He was also a classical pianist, teacher, author and composer, who performed at the chief courts of Europe, and received the royal appointment of mandolinist to the King of Italy. Cristofaro was born in Naples. He received his musical education in the Conservatory of Naples, devoting himself to the study of the piano. He was beaming a virtuoso on that instrument too, and would have outdone his achievements as a mandolinist. Cristofaro was entirely self-taught on the mandolin, and he soon distinguished himself by his performances on this instrument in Italy. To the Neapolitans, he introduced a new and completely advanced method of playing—accustomed as they were to hearing the instrument in the hands of strolling players for accompanying popular songs. The classical compositions, executed by Cristofaro, caused unbounded enthusiasm, astonishment, and admiration. His fame spread rapidly throughout Italy, and after appearing with success in all the important cities, he was induced to visit Paris. He arrived Paris in 1882, where he was immediately recognised as the premier mandolinist of the day; he won a widespread and enviable reputation, and as a teacher, his services were in constant demand by French aristocracy. During his residence in there, he appeared in public with the most prominent musicians of the time, including Charles Gounod, who, upon several occasions accompanied his solos with the pianoforte. In 1881, he had made a name in the musical world as a composer, and in that year several of his works were awarded high honours in Milan. That same year, Cristofaro visited London, performing successfully. He was sought there also as a teacher and was appointed conductor of the \"Ladies' Guitar and Mandolin Band.\" He repeated his visit to London during the following season giving mandolin recitals in which renowned mandolinist songwriter Luigi Denza and other eminent musicians took part. Cristofaro intended to reside a part of each season in London, and devote himself to teaching his instrument, but the 1889 visit was doomed to be his last. He had concluded arrangements to resume his lessons in London during Easter but died of ptomaine poisoning on 18 April 1890 in Paris. He left many pupils, and he was constantly engaged in composition and as a public performer. As a mandolinist, Cristofaro was important among those who wanted to elevate the science and art of mandolin playing; it was he who introduced the mandolin to the English public and brought about its popularity. As an executant, he was in many respects unsurpassed. His tone was remarkable for its exquisite tenderness and delicacy—his expression and nuances were unapproachable—and his tour de force were models of artistic excellence. He brought the higher mechanical attributes such as the shake, double stopping, the glissato and other effects peculiar to the instrument to perfection (which classed him among the virtuosi of the time). As a soloist, or in part playing, or again at the piano as accompanist, he well knew how to exhibit the mandolin to its greatest advantage. His mandolin was constructed according to his own design by the eminent maker, Salsedo of Naples, and was of exquisite workmanship. He usually performed with a plectrum of cherry bark."

  "text" : "The Cuban communist revolutionary and politician Fidel Castro took part in the Cuban Revolution from 1953 to 1959. Following on from his early life, Castro decided to fight for the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista's military junta by founding a paramilitary organisation, \"The Movement\". In July 1953, they launched a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks, during which many militants were killed and Castro was arrested. Placed on trial, he defended his actions and provided his famous \"History Will Absolve Me\" speech, before being sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment in the Model Prison on the Isla de Pinos. Renaming his group the \"26th of July Movement\" (MR-26-7), Castro was pardoned by Batista's government in May 1955, who no longer considered him a political threat. Restructuring the MR-26-7, he fled to Mexico with his brother Raul Castro, where he met with Argentine Marxist-Leninist Che Guevara, and together they put together a small revolutionary force intent on overthrowing Batista. In November 1956, Castro and 81 revolutionaries sailed from Mexico aboard the Granma, crash-landing near to Los Cayuelos. Attacked by Batista's forces, they fled to the Sierra Maestra mountain range, where the 19 survivors set up an encampment from which they waged guerrilla war against the army. Boosted by new recruits that increased the guerilla army's numbers to 200, they co-ordinated their attacks with the actions of other revolutionaries across Cuba, and Castro became an international celebrity after being interviewed by The New York Times. In 1958, Batista launched a counter-offensive, Operation Verano, but his army's use of conventional warfare was overwhelmed by Castro's guerrilla tactics, and the MR-26-7 eventually pushed out of the Sierra Maestra and took control of most of Oriente and Las Villas. Recognising that he was losing the war, Batista fled to the Dominican Republic while military leader Eulogio Cantillo took control of the country. With revolutionary forces controlling most of Cuba, Castro ordered Cantillo's arrest, before establishing a provisional government with Manuel Urrutia Lleó as President and José Miró Cardona as Prime Minister, ensuring that they enacted laws to erode the power of the Batistanos."

  "text" : "Frank Hastings Griffin (July 16, 1886 – October 14, 1974) invented the double-godet, a special stretch-spinning process that changed artificial silk to rayon. Artificial silk was originally too soft for practical use, but with the double-godet it became usable as rayon in many industrial products such as tire cords and clothing. Born in Chester, Pennsylvania, Griffin graduated from Swarthmore College in 1910, where he was an All-American basketball player. He received his master’s degree in Chemical Engineering from Columbia University in 1967, and an honorary doctorate from Drexel University in 1947. Griffin worked at American Viscose Corp from 1918 until his retirement, also serving as a director of the Southeast National Bank in Chester, the Delaware County Chamber of Commerce, the American Insulator Corp, and American Viscose Corp. He was married to Priscilla Tyler Goodwyn of Montgomery Alabama, a great-great granddaughter of President John Tyler. They had four children: Adele Griffin MacCoy Sands, Frank Hastings Griffin, John Tyler Griffin, and Priscilla Griffin Schaefer."

  "text" : "Filippo Rusuti, (c. 1255–c. 1325) was an Italian painter, active in Rome between 1288 and 1297, and in Naples around 1320. Rusuti belonged, along with Jacopo Torriti and Pietro Cavallini, to the so-called Roman school active in the late thirteenth century. Early in his career he worked on the fresco decoration of the Upper Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi, perhaps alongside or after Torriti. The work included some parts of the story of Genesis, in particular the creation of Adam and Eve and perhaps the construction of Noah's Ark. His only signed work is the upper register of the mosaic decoration of the old facade of the Roman church of Santa Maria Maggiore, where the presence of Cardinal Pietro Colonna allows dating of the mosaic between 1288 and 1297. Art historians believe that the lower register of the same mosaic, with the stories of the founding of the Santa Maria Liberiana, is to be considered an intervention a few years later by the followers of Rusuti based on his drawings. It was rebuilt for the presence of Rusuti (with his son John) in Poitiers, on the basis of a more careful reading of documents (now lost) which attest to a Filippus Bizuti or rather Ruzuti in 1309, in 1316-17, in the service of the king of France, but perhaps also in the wake of a column at the papal court in Avignon. Around 1319 Rusuti went to Naples at the Angevins court following Cavallini for the fresco decoration of the church of Santa Maria Donna Regina Vecchia, where his figures are probably the Prophets. Still in Naples, around 1320 he created some scenes from the Life of Christ in the Brancacci Chapel. In early June 2010, the artist and scholar Alfred Breitman attributed frescoes discovered in a tower of the palace Senate in the Capitol to Filippo Rusuti, with the consensus of historians of ancient art."

  "text" : "Frederic Poole Gorham (April 29, 1871 – June 4, 1933) was an American bacteriologist and educator. Born in Providence, Rhode Island, the son of businessman Samuel Gorham and his wife Abby Harding Fish, he was educated in local schools before graduating from Providence High School in 1889 and matriculating to Brown University. After graduating in 1893, he became an instructor of Biology at Brown and was awarded his A.M. in 1894 upon examination, with special studies performed at Harvard. On June 24, 1897, he was married to Emma Mary Lapham in Burrillville, Rhode Island. Thereafter he became an assistant professor in 1899, then associate professor in 1901. While doing so, he attended a series of lectures at Harvard University during 1902−1903. In 1913 he established bacteriology as a field of study at Brown University, becoming Professor of Bacteriology. In 1899, he was appointed bacteriologist for the Providence Department of Health, a post he occupied until 1933—primarily in an advisory capacity. He became secretary of the Board of Trustees of the Rhode Island State Tuberculosis Sanatorium in 1908. After helping to found the Society of American Bacteriologists, in 1911 he was named president of the organization. Two years later he became a bacteriologist for the Rhode Island Shellfish Commission, and in 1914 the deputy milk inspector for Providence. His first wife being deceased in 1913, he married Ruth Elizabeth Bjorkchahl on January 1, 1917—they would have one daughter, named Ruth. He served as chairman of the Laboratory Section for the American Public Health Association, and during 1925–1931 he served with the city park commission. In 1933, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Brown University, but died of a heart attack before he could receive it."

  "text" : "Filippo Coletti (11 May 1811 – 13 June 1894) was an Italian baritone associated with Giuseppe Verdi. Coletti created two Verdi roles: Gusmano in Alzira and Francesco in I Masnadieri. Verdi revised the role of Germont in La traviata for Coletti, whose interpretation re-defined the role as it is known today. Filippo Coletti was, with Antonio Tamburini (1800–1876) and Giorgio Ronconi (1810–1890), one of the three leading baritones of 19th century Italy, an early model of a 'Verdi baritone'. Born in Anagni, a small town southeast of Rome, Coletti started his career singing baritone coloratura roles in Rossini, Donizetti and Mercadante operas before moving on to vocally substantial Verdi repertory. Coletti gained notoriety in London for his unwitting role in the 1840 Haymarket Theatre riots, and later for his successful four-year London tenure, singing leading Baritone roles. Coletti travelled extensively, singing in all major European theatres. Numerous accounts describe his acting as well as the beauty of his voice, which retained an agility and elegance over a long singing career. Coletti performed until 1869. Verdi considered casting Coletti in an unrealized King Lear opera-commission for Naples. After Coletti's retirement from the stage he published an Album Melodico of songs, as well as essays on singing and on opera. For philosopher Thomas Carlyle Coletti was \"by the cast of his face, by the tones of his voice, by his general bearing,(...) a man of deep and ardent sensibilities, of delicate intuitions, just sympathies ; originally an almost poetic soul, or man of genius.\""

Pagano was active in Valencia, and primarily painted religious-themed works for local churches. He is credited with helping import the Italian Renaissance style to Spain. In 1472 he was commissioned in conjunction with Paolo da San Leocadio by the papal envoy Rodrigo Borja, a Spaniard who became Pope Alexander VI, to paint the ceiling of the Valencia Cathedral. A false ceiling had hidden the fresco for more than 330 years, until an investigation into some pigeons led to the discovery. He also painted, in 1506, again in conjunction with Paolo da San Leocadio, the doors of the high altar of the cathedral, with subjects from the Life of the Virgin."

Frederick was the younger brother of Henry Goulburn, under-secretary for the colonies 1812–1821 and later Chancellor of the Exchequer. Frederick Goulburn joined the army as a cornet in the 23rd Light Dragoons on 25 May 1805. Goulburn transferred to the 13th Light Dragoons in June 1813 and fought in the Peninsular war and later at Waterloo. Goulburn was appointed secretary and registrar of the records of New South Wales on 30 June 1820, very likely due to his brother's patronage. He was sworn-in as Colonial Secretary on 1 January 1821. Also in 1821 Thomas Brisbane was appointed Governor of New South Wales. He was doing useful work, but he could not escape the effects of the constant factional fights which also plagued previous governors. Brisbane discovered that Goulburn had been withholding documents from him and answering some without reference to him. In 1824 Brisbane reported his conduct to Lord Bathurst who Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. In reply, Bathurst recalled both Brisbane and Goulburn in dispatches dated 29 December 1824. Goulburn left New South Wales in February 1826 and died in Southgate, London, England on 10 February 1837."

He was a Muslim, one of many non-Sikhs in Ranjit Singh's secular government of the Sikh Empire. He was the eldest son of Hakīm Ghulām Mohy ud-Dīn and had two brothers, Nūr ud-Dīn and Imām ud-Dīn. Both had senior military posts in the empire. He was apprenticed as a physician, and was originally known by the title Hakīm (physician). Later in life he adopted the title Fakir (beggar), as a mark of humility, that title appearing in British correspondence after 1826. His first contact with Ranjit Singh was as a physician. The Maharaja was impressed by his medical skill and proficiency in languages – Arabic, Persian and English – and granted him a jagir and a position at court. His first major assignment was to assist the Maharaja in the negotiations with the British which led to the Treaty of Amritsar, 1809. Between 1810 and 1838 there followed a great number of diplomatic assignments and tasks as an interpreter. The Maharaja had complete trust in him and rewarded him with honours and jagirs. Aziz ud-Din continued in the service of the Sikh Empire after the death of Ranjit Singh.In December 1839 he represented Maharaja Kharak Singh on a mission to the British Governor-General, Lord Auckland. In 1842, on behalf of Maharaja Sher Singh, he welcomed the new Governor-General, Lord Ellenborough, at Firozpur. He remained scrupulously aloof from the factional intrigues which had overtaken the Empire after Ranjit Singh`s death. Saddened at the turn events had taken and by the death of two of his sons, he died in Lahore on 3 December 1845."

  "text" : "Francis Donald Klingender (1907 – 9 July 1955) was a Marxist art historian and exponent of Kunstsoziologie whose uncompromising views meant that he never quite fitted into the British art history establishment. Klingender was born in Goslar, Germany, to British parents. At the start of the first World War, his father, Louis Henry Weston Klingender (1861-1950), was interned near Berlin on suspicion of spying for the British. The family moved back to England in the 1920s and Klingender supported them while attending night classes at the London School of Economics. He subsequently embarked on an academic career in sociology, becoming a lecturer in that subject at the University of Hull, which position he retained until his death. His magnum opus was Animals in Art and Thought to the End of the Middle Ages, published posthumously, and edited by Evelyn Antal, wife of Frederick Antal, and John Harthan. Klingender inherited an interest in this subject from his father who had been a painter of animals, and he added to that his own sociological, Marxist and Freudian interpretations. His thesis was that as well as being the companions and servants of man, the depiction of animals in art was symbolic of the hidden or secret urges of society. He was encouraged in his work by Julian Huxley, whose suggestions were incorporated into the final work. Klingender had intended to complete the work up to the nineteenth century, and possibly later, however, on his death the manuscript was only substantially complete up to the end of the Middle Ages and the editors took the decision to publish only up to that point, hence the chosen title. Later periods were added as an Epilogue from the available notes."

  "text" : "Frederick Sinnett (8 March 1830 – 23 November 1866) was a literary critic and journalist in colonial Australia. Sinnett was born in Hamburg, Germany, a son of Mrs. Percy Sinnett, a well-known English author, and was educated for the profession of civil engineer. He went to South Australia in 1849 as engineer to the Adelaide and Port Railway Company; but the scheme was never carried out. He then went into partnership with Thomas Burr, a former Deputy Surveyor General of South Australia, eventually (in 1857 in Melbourne) marrying Burr's eldest daughter, Jane. During this period he contributed regularly to the Mining Journal, edited by George Stevenson, at that time considered the best-conducted paper in South Australia. When the Victorian gold fields were discovered in 1851 Sinnett left South Australia for Melbourne, and accepted an engagement as contributor to the Herald, of which paper he became eventually editor and part proprietor. About 1855 he severed his connection with that paper and became a contributor to the Melbourne Argus, with which journal he remained till 1859, with the exception of a short period spent in editing the Daily News at Geelong. About the time that he joined the Argus was commenced the Melbourne Punch, of which journal he was one of the founders, and to the success of which he greatly contributed. In 1859 Sinnett again returned to South Australia to take the management of the Adelaide Ice Works. During his sojourn in South Australia from 1859 to 1865 he edited the Daily Telegraph, and was Parliamentary reporter for Hansard. He returned to Melbourne in 1865, where he resumed his connection with the Argus and was retained on the literary staff of that paper as contributor and leader-writer until within a short time of his death on 23 November 1866 in Kew, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."

In 1474, Finola O’Donnell helped establish the Franciscan Monastery in Donegal with her husband. The monastery was given to God and the friars of St. Francis. It was meant as a place “for the prosperity of their own souls” as well as a “burial place for themselves and their descendants.” Finola died in 1528. Between the years of 1632 and 1636, the monastery served as the location for the writing of The Annals of the Four Masters. The authors were said to scour the country for information during the warm seasons and stay within the monastery to write during the cold."

  "text" : "Fyodor Mikhaylovich Matveyev (Russian: Фёдор Михайлович Матвеев, 1758 — 1826) was a Russian classicist landscape painter, most recognizable for his Italian landscapes. He was one of the first Russian landscape painters. Matveyev was a son of a soldier of the Izmaylovsky Regiment. He was admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts, where he graduated from in 1778 with a Grand Gold medal.One of his professors was Semyon Shchedrin. Matveyev specialized from the very beginning as a landscape painter and became the first landscape artist graduated with a gold medal. He was subsequently awarded a fellowship to travel to Europe, as was common at the time for talented graduates of the Academy. In 1779, Matveyev travelled to Italy and eventually settled there. He never returned to Russia and died in Italy in 1826. Matveyev travelled back and forth in Italy and surrounding countries, painting landscapes. Initlally, he had commissions from Russian nobles residing in Italy. Eventually, the commissions thinned out, and Matveyev wrote letters to the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1789 and 1795, asking to subsidize his return to Russia. Apparently, he did not receive any reply. In 1806, he sent his painting View around Naples to the Academy and was awarded the title of the academician. He created oil paintings as well as a number of graphic works. Most of the paintings are made according to the strict rules of classicism, meaning the image is similar to the theater scene, with buildings or trees at the sides. There are always people present in the landscape, to indicate the scale. Landscapes by Matveyev never represent original landscapes with photographic precision. In contrast, his drawings are much more skewed towards Romanticism, and may actually be first Russian Romantic landscapes."

  "text" : "Francisco Abad Moreno, better known as \"Chaleco\", was one of many Spanish guerrilleros who came to prominence in the Spanish War of Independence. Based around Valdepeñas, near the Sierra Morena that separates the central part of Spain form Andalusia, Chaleco, unlike many other guerrilleros, who were basically brigands, was a shepherd who had joined the fight against the French troops after his mother and brother were killed in the Valdepeñas Uprising in June 1808. By December 1811, when it was incorporated into the Spanish Army as the Valdepeñas Hussars, his group of mounted guerrilleros numbered 300. By the end of the war, he had risen to the rank of colonel, due, in part, to the patronage of General Castaños, who had led the Spanish troops at the decisive Battle of Bailén. In 1815, he had gone on to head the Spanish 5th Army. Although \"Chaleco\" was hanged at Granada in September 1827 for his part in the liberal plots against Ferdinand VII and fighting for the Liberals, travel writer George Borrow, in the course of his travels through Spain, around 1835–40, claimed to have had occasion to meet \"Chaleco\", a meeting he recorded as \"The Gipsy Soldier of Valdepenas\", in his two-volume The Zincali; or, an Account of the Gipsies of Spain. With an Original Collection of their Songs and Poetry, and a Copious Dictionary of their Language (1841)."

Summerfield Ltd., and was the agent for American Chrysler cars. He started assembling Chrysler's in 1933 at his factory on Castleforbes Road, after the introduction of the requirement that all cars sold in Ireland had to be assembled there. He was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1925 Seanad election. A Peace Commissioner, Summerfield served as an independent member of the Seanad, representing the interests of the motor industry.

  "text" : "Francisco Palacios Miranda was the Governor and Military Commandant of the Baja California Territory from 1844 to 1847. He is known for his cooperation with the Americans during the Mexican American War, accepting neutrality of his Territory in 1846 and making the abject surrender of La Paz to the Americans in 1847. For this he was declared a traitor and forced into exile at the end of the war. On August 17, 1846, Commodore of the Pacific Squadron, Robert F. Stockton proclaimed: \"...having by right of conquest taken possession of that territory known by the name of Upper and Lower California do now declare it to be a territory of the United States under the name of the Territory of California.\" Holding only part of Alta California and no part of the Territory of Baja California, Stockton was overstating the facts in the extreme. To carry out his intent to blockade the West coast of Mexico and to in fact control Baja California, on August 19, Stockton ordered the blockade of San Blas and Mazatlán. While stopping at La Paz, on the southeast corner of Baja California, and San José del Cabo, at the southern tip of the peninsula, Commander Samuel F. Du Pont, commander of the second-class sloop-of-war Cyane secured a promise of neutrality from Colonel Miranda. This allowed the American Navy to seize ships in the ports and get water and provisions there to support their blockade of the other Mexican ports on the west coast of the mainland. Receiving this report of weakness from Du Pont, returning to San Francisco from the blockade in October, Stockton on February 2, 1847 ordered Commander John B. Montgomery on the first-class sloop-of-war Portsmouth to reestablish the blockade at Mazatlán and to raise the United States flag at San José del Cabo, La Paz, Pichilinque and Loreto. After reimposing a blockade at Mazatlán Montgomery sailed for Baja California. On April 14, Colonel Miranda surrendered La Paz and in effect all of Baja California to the Americans. A committee of residents soon afterward signed articles of capitulation which granted them United States citizen rights and the retention of their own officials and laws, as had been offered by the Americans before in Alta California. However as in Alta California, patriotic bajacalifornios were not ready to quietly surrender. On February 15, a council meeting of resistors at Santa Anita, north of San José del Cabo, declared Miranda a traitor and named Mauricio Castro Cota, of San José del Cabo, as his successor. On November 16, 1847 Mexican forces under Manuel Pineda, made a sudden assault on the U.S. Army garrison at La Paz but failed to take the town. However as they withdrew on the 17th, they burned ex-Governor Miranda's town house. At the end of the Mexican American War, in early August, 1848 the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers occupying Baja California were ordered to return to Alta California to be discharged. They were accompanied by over 130 refugees from La Paz and 350 from San José. Among the refugees was ex-governor Francisco Palacios Miranda, forced to abandon his lands and property."

Delany, Gentleman. (2007, USA), which premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. The New Yorker said: \"Taylor’s understated direction, featuring simple images that prod Delany’s recollections gently along, makes the film a lively and thoughtful look at a deeply lived-in life.\". Jump Cut said that “Taylor’s film illustrates Delany’s life through a series of what Roland Barthes called biographemes (preferences, inflections, details to which the author might be distilled).” It was voted Best Documentary Feature, 2008 at the Philadelphia International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and was an official selection of the 2008 International Festival of Films on Art, Montreal, London International LGFF, FRAMELINE (San Francisco GLFF), OUTFEST (Los Angeles GLFF), REELING (Chicago International GLFF), Seattle GLFF.

Francisca lived in a time when it was very uncommon for educated women to teach and lecture in a university. Spain was one of the few places where women were able to succeed. A part of the reason for this was Queen Isabella who herself was a very well educated woman that encouraged “the love of study by personal example.” In addition to this, women like Francisca were oftentimes able to succeed because their fathers were already in that field and able to help open doors. Francisca de Lebrija was born to scholar Antonio de Nebrija and Doña Isabel Montesinos de Solis. She was able to successfully lecture in rhetoric to such an extent that it was said to have been done to applause. In addition to this, some sources point to her having assisted her father with his research and writings however, none of her personal work has survived."

This line-up also recorded a 45, “Frog Stomp”, co-written by Newman and Hayes. Newman and Hayes had previously coincided in Ben Branch’s house band at the Tropicana Club, with Hayes as a vocalist. As a member of the House horn section at Stax, in 1965 he would go on to become a founding member of the Memphis Horns, with Wayne Jackson and Gene \"Bowlegs\" Miller on trumpets, Floyd Newman on baritone sax and Andrew Love on tenor."

  "text" : "Felipe de Guevara (died 1563, in Madrid) was a Spanish humanist, art writer and patron. Felipe was the illegitimate son of ambassador and art collector Diego de Guevara. He maintained close relations with people of the world of culture of his time. He was interested in various fields of knowledge such as numismatics, geography and history. Like his father, he also had a great passion for art. He had a great appreciation for the work in particular of Hieronymus Bosch, who was featured in his great work Comentarios de la pintura (Comments on Painting). His work remained as a manuscript until it was published in 1788 by Antonio Ponz. Sánchez Cantón felt it was probably written around 1560, shortly before his death. In his \"Commentaries\" Felipe devotes a section to fresco painting, the grotesques, painting on canvas, encaustic, lighting, mosaics, and oil. He refers to the writings of Pliny the Elder regarding the invention of painting in encaustic by Aristides (although Guevara believes that it was used previously), and its perfection by Praxiteles. He also credits the ancients with the invention of oil painting, a technique that in the sixteenth century was considered of recent origin. The most interesting chapter of Guevara's work is about fresco and stucco decoration, which steps through the implementation process and the materials used at the time. Although it refers to the text of Vitruvius, this source is continuously compared with traditional uses of Spain, making the passage a document of the first order for this technique, popular in the 16th century."

Blevins served in both the Legislative Council and House of Assembly. He was a minister in a number of portfolios. In 1983 in a dispute about the use of volunteers in the ambulance service, as minister for Health, he publicly sided with the St. John Council who managed the ambulance service and two unions, the Ambulance Employees Association and the Miscellaneous Workers Association. John Cornwall, reflects that this position probably damaged his credibility at the time, with both unions and the Labor Party. Blevins was Treasurer of South Australia from 1992 to 1993. Prior to entering parliament he was a British merchant seaman and then a merchant seaman at Whyalla. He died at his home in 2013."

  "text" : "Fortune (c. 1743 – 1798) was an African-American slave who achieved posthumous notability over the transfer of his remains from a museum storage room to a state funeral. Under the laws of the 18th century American colonial period, Fortune, his wife Dinah, and their four children were the property of Dr. Preserved Porter, a physician based in Waterbury, Connecticut. Fortune drowned in an accident in the Naugatuck River in 1798, and Dr. Porter dissected his body and preserved his skeleton for anatomic study. The Porter family held Fortune’s remains before donating them to the Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury, where they were on display through the 1970s, after which point they were put in storage. In 1999, the museum received national attention when media coverage highlighted the discovery of Fortune’s remains. Although the skeleton was initially dubbed \"Larry,\" as that name was written on its skull, a later investigation by the African-American Historic Project Committee determined the skeleton belonged to Fortune. The museum created a special exhibit in honor of Fortune that detailed the lives of African-American slaves in the early part of the 19th century. On September 12, 2013, Fortune’s remains were transferred to the Connecticut State Capitol, where they laid in state before being escorted by state police to St. John's Episcopal Church on the Green, the Waterbury parish where Fortune was baptized in 1797, and a funeral at the city’s Riverside Cemetery."

In 1810, he became a member of Society of Painters in Watercolours, an organization whose members had seceded from the Royal Academy over complaints that their work was not being recognized. Nash primarily painted landscapes, and made sketching trips to Calais, Caen, the Moselle river and the Rhine. In 1834 he moved to Brighton where he continued working until his death in 1856."

  "text" : "Frederick Smallfield ARWS (1825 – 10 September 1915) was a Victorian English oil and watercolour artist, whose work shows a Pre-Raphaelite influence. Smallfield trained at the Royal Academy Schools in the late 1840s, at the same time as various members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, although he seems not to have been closely associated with them. In 1858, Smallfield's watercolours were praised in Academy Notes by John Ruskin. In 1860, he was elected Associate of the Watercolour Society (ARWS). He contributed two illustrations, The Shoeblack and A Christmas Invitation, to Passages From Modern English Poets (1862), one called A Father's Lament to Robert Aris Willmott's English Sacred Poetry of the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth, and Nineteenth Centuries (1863) and another to The Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century at the Great Exhibition MDCCCLI by Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, published by Day & Son, London, 1851–1853. He exhibited works in oil at the Royal Academy until the late 1870s. His work is now in the collections of the Royal Institution of Cornwall (The Ringers of Launcells Tower, 1887), Manchester City Galleries (Early Lovers, 1857), and the Atkinson Art Gallery at Southport (The Lost Glove, 1858). Some of his drawings are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, including a sketch of a wall decoration by John Gregory Crace."

She was politically active and exerted an acknowledged influence over the affairs of state. She was a strong supporter of the First Crusade. She is described as an ideal of simplicity, virtue and modesty for the women of Venice, in contrast to what had been the case with the previous dogaressa, Theodora Anna Doukaina Selvo. During the First Crusade, she organised the funds necessary to establish hospitals, beds and food for the pilgrims and crusaders, and set an example by selling her jewelry and clothes and cutting down the representation of the doge court life. She also encouraged the mothers to send their sons away to serve in the crusade. In 1099, the Venetians financed an escort fleet to protect the crusaders on their way to Syria. The influence of Felicia upon the affairs of state was common knowledge: Mathilda of Tuscany asked Felicia to persuade Venice to assist her to pacify the rebellious Ferrara, something Felicia also successfully did."

  "text" : "Alphons William Bernhard Johannes (Fons) Bemelmans (born 8 January 1938 in Maastricht) is a Dutch artist, best known as sculptor. He also works as goldsmith, painter, graphic artist and medal artist. Bemelmans began his training as goldsmith in 1955 at the Stadsacademie voor Toegepaste Kunsten in Maastricht, where in 1958 he St. Luke Price won. From 1960 to 1962 he went to study with Professor Ludwig Gies in Cologne at the Kölner Werkschulen and afterwards with the Italian sculptor Luciano Minguzzi at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milan until 1963. His work can be described as abstracted figurative with the classic theme of myths and legends caught in dreamy yet powerful shapes. Fons Bemelmans lives and works in Eijsden. He signs his work sometimes with AB. In the 1980s he was also working as Professor at the School of Fine Arts, Amsterdam. His work has been bought by the British Museum. In 1999 Fons Bemelmans was appointed Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau."

  "text" : "Francesco Vinea (Forlì, August 10, 1845 - Florence, October 22, 1902) was an Italian painter, known for his period costume genre subjects. He studied first at the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence, but had to discontinue his studies due to his poverty, and spent some time traveling without home. He worked for a photographer, also as a designer of illustrated magazines, but returned to Florence and studied under professor Enrico Pollastrini, but only for a year. He was not inclined to the erudite historical or literary paintings, or earnest depictions of natural scenes, favored by some academic contemporaries. He meddled in an imaginative, often raffish or coquettish, and always elegant depictions of dramas in elegant period costume occurring in equally ornamented interiors. The paintings proved popular in England and France, and Vinea gained a comfortable living. His studio on boulevard Prince Eugene in Florence is depicted as hoard of exotic items, and eclectic furniture and decorative items: a collection easily finding his way as ornaments of his paintings. Gubernatis describes his studio as his best work of art. The ceiling painted in tempera with Olympic gods, in allegory to the fine arts, and his collected items haphazardly stored. Gubernatis describes his subject matter as: Nothing serious, nothing solid, no classical concepts, not robust, no lofty ideas, no deep thoughts. His canvases, like the genre paintings of Meissonier, are well-designed witticisms, smiling color, interiors full of life and of panache, costume scenes preening with grace and trivial levity: everything exudes the fashion of the past salons. Once you have accepted the genre, Vinea is no doubt that the few who treat it with fertility of imagination, careful study of detail and splendor of the palette. The subjects of his canvases fade from memory like iridescent soap bubbles flit from our vision. Among his works Baccanale di soldati and a woman in a canteen titled Alla più bella; La visita alla nonna; Un rapimento; Una bagnante; Il Vescovo; and Un appuntamento."

  "text" : "Francisco Varela (c. 1580 – 1645), was a Spanish Baroque painter. He was born, lived and worked all his life in Seville, where in 1625 a teacher was responsible to check the skills of the aspiring artist to join the guild of painters in the city. As most of the painters of his generation, his was originally a Mannerist style evolved towards naturalism, anticipating in some respects to the model developed later by Francisco de Zurbarán. The work that has come from Varela is scarce. There are two representations of the Last Supper, one of them made in 1622, probably inspired by a mannerist engraving, is located in the Church of San Bernardo in Seville, the other with an iconography very similar, was acquired in 2004 by the Regional Government of Andalusia, is on display at the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville. Also of note is the Portrait of Martinez Montanes (1616) belonging to the city of Seville and San Miguel Archangel (1629). One of his last known works, executed in 1640, is the set of paintings made for the Convent of the Passion of Seville which are also exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts. The series consists of San Cristóbal and San Augustine, St. Catherine of Siena with Santa Lucia and St. Catherine of Alexandria with St. Teresa of Jesus."

From 1858 to 1874 he was mayor in the town of Le Plantay. In 1850 he became a corresponding member of the Société linnéenne de Lyon. In Lyon, he had as influences; entomologists Antoine Foudras and Étienne Mulsant, with whom he published several papers on Coleoptera. For many years he abandoned entomological work, resuming these activities later on in life as he conducted collection excursions in France, Switzerland and Austria. His Coleoptera collection was acquired by Paul de Fréminville (1859-1939), who subsequently made it part of his personal insect collection. Later it was transferred to the Musée de Brou in Bourg-en-Bresse, and since 1997 it has been housed at the Muséum de Lyon. Guillebeau is the taxonomic authority of numerous species of beetles, as well as the circumscriber of several genera; e.g. Tinodemus, Podocesus, Nesiotus, Entomocnemus and Ochrodemus.

  "text" : "Francisco de Palacios, also Francisco Palacios, (1623-January 1652), was a Spanish Baroque painter. De Palacios was initially known through only two small still lifes, acquired in Madrid in late seventeenth century by Count Ferdinand Harrach Buenaventura, published by August L. Mayer in 1922, and two paintings of San Onofre and San Francisco de Asis in the convent Calatravas Moralzarzal (Madrid). When the paintings were first seen, Buenaventura saw the influence of Antonio Ponz, and thought maybe the author was El Greco, so he was surprised when he recognized the signing of Palacios. Palacios was therefore primarily understood to be a still life painter until later research revealed he had done portraits and landscapes as well. In January 1646 he married Josefa Berges, daughter of painter and paint merchant Francisco Berges, stating in the contract they were both older than twenty. The couple had two children, and in December 1651, being seriously ill, gave testament, ordering six hundred Masses with other demands, including one for the canonization of St. Maria de la Cabeza, indicating a good financial standard of living. He died in Madrid in January 1652, having fixed his residence on the street of Alcala. Both in the will as at the auction of the estate of his father, who died in 1672, there are interesting news about the paintings of various palaces, covering all genres. Along with some unspecified paintings for Nicholas Jacobs, are cited in the will a portrait of Doña Teresa, wife of Joseph Ferriol official of the secretariat of the Indies, and landscape in any number you did to Juan Pastrana, of those still was owed certain amounts. In addition, to Jerome Gonzalez Bricianos, cashier Manuel Lopez de Salcedo made a large picture of the Virgin and St. Joseph and the Infant Jesus and Eternal Glory to the Father. Also cited by Palacios were three \"Orchard stained by natural\", another still life of \"a table with some peaches and olives and clay\" , and \"a landscape and a Crowning with thorns\". The relationship with Diego Velázquez who he is believed to have been a disciple could be indirectly confirmed by a curious clause in the will by which he said he had given \"Don Diego de Silva a garnish of sword and dagger which is what this update brings\". Based on style characteristics, Palacios has recently attributed the famous painting of The Knight's Dream, traditionally assigned to Antonio de Pereda. Lately Azanza Javier Lopez, an art historian for the University of Navarra, greatly expanded the number of known works of the painter. The delicate treatment of the hands, so different from that usually found in the work of Pereda, could be also another argument in favor of the new painting attribution."

In 1884 he raised a volunteer naval artillery corps at Sydney. In 1885 he was promoted to commander of the Wolverine. From 1888 to 1892 Taylor served in the Queensland gunboat HMQS Gayundah as first lieutenant. In October 1888 the commander of the Gayundah Captain Henry Townley Wright, after a dispute with authorities, was ordered to turn the gunboat over to Taylor. Wright had Taylor arrested but later released him; Wright was dismissed from the Maritime Defence Force. Taylor was later promoted to senior naval officer and superintendent of the Queensland Naval Defence Force in November 1888. In 1899 he returned to England and settled at Saltash, and in 1901 was given charge of the Naval Employment Agency at Devonport, Devon. His wife was a daughter of the late Rev. W. J. M. Hillyar and granddaughter of Admiral William Hillyar."

The first Heisman Trophy, a strong young bull of a football player cast in bronze, was presented to a college football player in 1935, and is considered one of the greatest honors a college athlete can receive. Over the years the Heisman Committee has paid tribute to Eliscu and his creation several times, and in 1985, the Heisman Committee invited him to speak at the 50th Anniversary Heisman ceremonies. Since then he has amassed a body of work that spans from public fountains to ex-President Gerald Ford's inaugural medal (later given as a gift to Leonid Brezhnev when Ford visited Russia), to the five-story rone frieze that decorates the glass panes above the doors to the Library of Congress. This massive sculpture won the Henry Hering Memorial Medal from the National Sculpture Society. Eliscu also is represented in the Metropolitan Museum of Art with his \"Sea Treasures.\" A resident of New York and later Sarasota, Eliscu died in Sarasota, Florida on June 19 1996 at the age of 83."

  "text" : "Frederick Layton (May 18, 1827 – August 16, 1919) was an English-American businessman, philanthropist and art collector. He immigrated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin with his father in 1843, when the city was still a pioneer village. He played a major role in the creation of Milwaukee’s meat packing industry and established a trans-Atlantic business exporting his meat products to Great Britain. During his lifetime, he made 99 trips across the Atlantic pursuing business interests and collecting fine art in London and the other capitals of Europe. Throughout his life, he consistently donated his money to support local charities and Milwaukee’s art community. In 1888, he built the Layton Art Gallery on the corner of Mason and Jefferson Streets in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, one of the nation’s earliest single-patron public art galleries. By creating an endowment for the Gallery, and with donations from the Gallery Trustees and friends, Layton was personally able to purchase over 200 works of art for the Gallery before dying at the age of 92. Though the original building of the Layton Art Gallery no longer exists, many of Mr. Layton’s purchases comprise the founding, core collection of early European and American art at the Milwaukee Art Museum. The Layton Art Collection Board of Trustees still supports and maintains the historic collection in collaboration with Milwaukee Art Museum staff and volunteers."

  "text" : "Johan Fritiof Enbom (7 September 1918 – 11 September 1974) was a Swedish railway worker who was accused and convicted of being a spy for the Soviet Union in the 1950s. Born in Luleå, Enbom was a former worker at the Swedish State Railways in Boden, and later the local editor for the Communist newspaper Norrskensflamman. He was exposed by his own careless talk—often under the influence of alcohol—to the owners of the house in Stockholm where he had lodged since he moved there from Boden. The family told the Swedish Security Service after the Christmas holidays of 1951, and Enbom was arrested on 16 February 1952. During interrogation, he confessed that he—from February 1943 to April 1951—had met around 25 times with Soviet employers. Enbom had provided a large variety of intelligence, most of it from public sources, but also secrets about armaments in Boden Fortress and nearby fortifications. He was sentenced to lifetime hard labour, but was released after ten years. Enbom had, according to a police investigation, collected material about the defence locations of northern Sweden. Enbom had then given this information to the Soviet Union. In hindsight it has been proven that most of the information that Enbom gave to the Soviet Union was public and could be easily found by anyone interested. Enbom also said that he was the last chain in a large chain of Soviet spies who gave secret information. Most investigators that view the case today have concluded that Enbom largely lied or made up most of his stories about his spying or at least his role in the spying on Sweden for the Soviet Union. Lund University professor Wilhelm Agrell, on the other hand, has concluded that Enbom provided KGB agent Vladimir Petrov with a lot of secret information from Sweden about its defence. Endom died in 1974 in Stockholm."

In 1855 he relocated to Chile as a pharmaceutical industrialist, eventually settling in Santiago de Chile. While in South America, he traveled the Argentine Pampas, publishing \"Escursion a las pampas arjentinas : hojas de mi diario, febrero de 1871\" as a result. While collecting specimens in the Juan Fernández Archipelago, he discovered the Alejandro Selkirk firecrown (Sephanoides fernandensis leyboldi), a subspecies of hummingbird endemic to Alejandro Selkirk Island. It is now classified as extinct; the last sighting of the subspecies was in 1908. He provided descriptions for a number of botanical species and is the taxonomic authority of the family Tecophilaeaceae. The hard fern species Blechnum leyboldtianum (synonym Blechnum blechnoides) is named in his honor. He was author of a monograph on the botanical order Salicineae that became part of the \"Flora Brasiliensis\" series. The standard author abbreviation Leyb. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Fay Jones (born 1936, birth name Fay Bailey) is an American artist, based in Seattle, Washington. A large number of her works are exhibited in public places in the Pacific Northwest, including a mural in the Westlake Station of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and a painting in Seattle's opera house, McCaw Hall. A 1986 retrospective organized by the Boise Art Museum also showed at the Seattle Art Museum. Jones's father, Robeson Bailey (1906-1972), taught writing and was an early faculty member of the Middlebury College's Bread Loaf Writers' Conference. Family friends in her childhood included Dorothy Parker, Robert Frost, Louis Untermeyer, John Ciardi, A. B. Guthrie and Wallace Stegner. However the family was not wealthy. For some years beginning in 1950, the family operated a small hotel in Williamsburg, Massachusetts, where Jones worked in the kitchen, as well as taking care of her younger siblings. In 1953, she graduated from high school and enrolled in the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). In 1956, she met RISD drawing instructor Robert C. Jones (b. 1930); they married the following year, and moved to Seattle in 1960, where Robert Jones became a member of the art faculty of the University of Washington. They had four children, born between 1958 and 1966. Fay was primarily a homemaker in those years, but managed to set aside some time to make artworks, mainly in small formats. She had her first exhibit in 1970 at the Francine Seders Gallery in Seattle. The following year, she and her husband bought a run-down house, originally \"more a shack\" according to Jones, north of Seattle in the Skagit Valley, which became their summer place for the next 25 years. Over time they fixed up the house and built a separate outbuilding with studio space. Jones reputation as an artist grew. In the mid-1980s, she was selected, along with Roger Shimomura and Gene Gentry McMahon to design major murals for the Westlake Station of the new Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel. A 1996 retrospective organized by the Boise Art Museum also showed at the Seattle Art Museum and at the Washington State University Museum of Art in Pullman, Washington. She illustrated one card (Stasis) for the debut set of the soon-to-be-famous Magic: The Gathering trading card game as a favor for her nephew, the game's designer Richard Garfield. In the mid-1990s the Joneses sold their Skagit place and a few years later bought a house in Guanajuato, Mexico, where their son Tom already lived as a symphony orchestra musician. In 2006, Jones and her husband had a joint show at the Casa Museo Gene Byron in Guanajuato; however, they sold their home there in 2009 and bought a live/work studio in Tieton, Washington, near Yakima; both Joneses are active with the Tieton-based print studio Goathead Press. They maintain a primary residence in West Seattle."

For please see Farrukh-Shah Al-Malik al-Mansur Izz ad-Din Abu Sa'id Farrukhshah Dawud was the Ayyubid Emir of Baalbek between 1179 and 1182 and Na'ib (Viceroy) of Damascus. He was the son of Saladin’s younger brother Nur ad-Din Shahanshah and the older brother of Taqi ad-Din Umar who became Emir of Hama. In 1178 Saladin decided that the administration of his brother Shams ad-Din Turanshah in Damascus was too lax, and its relations with the Zangid rulers of Aleppo rather too friendly. He therefore moved Turanshah and selected his nephew Farrukhshah as his successor. Farrukhshah had already proved himself to be a good soldier and he appears to have met Saladin’s expectations as an administrator, as he remained viceroy of Damascus until his death in October 1182 (Jumada 1 578). Turanshah was compensated for his loss of Damascus with the domain of Baalbek, but he did not hold it for long. In May 1179 (Dhu’l Qa’da 574) Saladin moved him again and made him governor of Alexandria. For a second time, Farrukhshah was the beneficiary of Turanshah’s removal and Saladin gave him Baalbek. Much of his reign was occupied in supporting Saladin’s wars against the crusaders. Shortly after his appointment to Baalbek, Farrukhshah won a victory near the fortress of Belfort against Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, killing Humphrey II of Toron. Farrukhshah died in September 1182 (Jumada I 578) leaving a young boy, al-Amjad Bahramshah, as his successor."

  "text" : "In May 1888 he caught Scarlet Fever, the results of which disabled him for the rest of his life. He was rendered short sighted and suffered partial deafness. In 1892 his family moved to Middlesbrough and it was Albert Park, Middlesbrough that became his source of interest and his playground. It was here that he contracted pneumonia that rendered him very weak with empyema. For many years he had to use a bath chair. In 1895 he worked at William Jacks & Co, Iron Merchants. This was after a further period of ill health when he was unable to take examinations. In April 1897 he had to leave to have a serious chest operation at North Riding Infirmary. He remained for only a short period and being very weak he was carried by his father so he could die at home. His will to live was very strong and he was taken to recuperate at Ingleby Greenhow at the foot of Urra Moor on which lies the highest point of the North York Moors. It was here he took in the sights of the North Eastern moorland and the blue escarpments, the plant life, insects, birds and observed the Cleveland Hills from his wheelchair. It was the local Vicar of Ingleby Greenhow, The Reverend John Hawell a collector of specimens of natural history, Section Secretary of choncology of 'Clevelands Naturalists' Field Club' and later President in 1891, 1895, 1896, 1903 and 1904, that attracted him to the subject. This led him to join the Cleveland Naturalists' Field Club on his return to Middlesbrough. He became Honorary Assistant Secretary in 1899 until 1906 before he became Honorary Secretary in 1907 until 1921 then President in 1922 and 1923 - he was a Vice President from 1924 until 1932. It was during the period he was not in work that he taught himself the languages Latin, French and German, and studied Botany, Geology, Conchology and Astrology. This three-month stay was a defining moment of his life and he resolved to investigate and understand the origins of the area that had increased and fired his curiosity. The areas near Eston Nab were close by and the main place for his future investigations. He received a prize from The Northern Weekly Gazette for the best contribution on entomology or astronomy. He used this towards bus and train fares or to pay for a night's lodging at a remote moorland farm. This allowed him to cover the whole of the northeast moorland. Frank was able to investigate the moors in the summer and in the winter, and during bad weather he would read and write keeping a careful record of his travels and investigations, and maintain his diaries - he referred to this as 'dry work'."

  "text" : "Fukumoto Kazuo (福本和夫); (4.July 1894-16.November 1983) was a Japanese Marxist and one of the most important theoretician of the Japanese Communist Party during the 1920s. Fukumoto was born in Tottori Prefecture to a moderately prosperous landowning family. He studied law at Tokyo Imperial University and became a lecturer at a high school after graduation. In 1922 he was sent to Europe to study law, there he familiarized himself with Marxism, he also joined the German Communist party. When he returned home in 1924 he joined a small communist group and became an editor for a small magazine simply called Marxism. Fukumoto wrote numerous articles and was well known in left-wing circles for his interpretations of Marxism-Leninism and his criticism of other Japanese Marxist scholars, especially Yamakawa Hitoshi and Kawakami Hajime. His writing style was considered complex and he was more interested in the theoretical than the practical aspects of Socialism. Fukumoto called for the separation of “true” Marxist from “false” Marxists and urged the “true” Marxists to concentrate on theoretical struggle. This approach was popular among young intellectuals and was called Fukumotoism, as opposed to the more pragmatic mass-based approach of Yamakawa called Yamakawaism. Fukumoto´s main contribution was to improve the theoretical foundation of the communist party and the revolution, the dangers in his ideas where however that excessive focus on theory could isolate the party from other left-wing groups. Eventually the Cominterm took the view that this was happening and in 1927 it issued a thesis attacking both Yamakawa and Fukumoto and demanding that the party strive for an immediate two-stage revolution to overthrow the Japanese government, and especially the Emperor system and Diet of Japan, redistribution of wealth and favourable policy with the USSR.

  "text" : "Finn Michael Westby Caspersen, Sr. (October 27, 1941 – September 7, 2009) was an American financier and philanthropist. A graduate of Brown University and Harvard Law School, he followed his father, Olaus Caspersen, a Norwegian immigrant to the United States, as chairman and chief executive of Beneficial Corporation, one of the largest consumer finance companies in the United States. After an $8.6 billion acquisition of Beneficial by Household International in 1998, Caspersen ran Knickerbocker Management, a private financial firm overseeing the assets of trusts and foundations. As a philanthropist, Caspersen donated tens of millions of dollars to the Peddie School, Brown, Harvard, and Drew University, while overseeing the Hodson Trust, which benefitted four institutions in Maryland. He described education as his \"particular love\" and regarded it as \"an investment in the future—an investment in human capital.\" Buildings and endowed professorships have been named in his honor. Caspersen's philanthropy extended to rowing and equestrian sports, and service to the United States Equestrian Team Foundation, Princeton National Rowing Association, and the National Rowing Foundation. Caspersen was an influential donor to Republican candidates at the state and national level. In the 1980s, he was a major supporter of former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean. He served as a town commissioner in Jupiter Island, Florida, an exclusive upper-class enclave, for four years, resigning a few weeks before his suicide in September 2009. News reports linked Caspersen with financial problems and accusations of alleged large-scale tax evasion that were discovered in the course of federal investigations into offshore tax shelters managed by financial firms UBS and LGT Bank, and used by wealthy American clients. Near the end of his life, Caspersen was subjected to an IRS audit with a possible focus on alleged offshore accounts. An attorney for Caspersen’s estate claimed that in 2013 the IRS effectively exonerated Caspersen posthumously—with no penalties or fines for offshore accounts or anything else."
