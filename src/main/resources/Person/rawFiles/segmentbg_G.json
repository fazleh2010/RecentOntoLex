  "text" : "George Cores (20 September 1867 – 20 September 1949) was an anarchist and militant trade unionist. Raised in dire poverty in London's East End, George's illiterate Hanover-born father, John Henry Christopher Kors  laboured under fearful conditions in a local sugar refinery until he died, aged just 38, of \"lung and heart disease\", before George's first birthday. Cores was close to Freedom, but held long protracted disputes with some of the other members particularly Thomas Keell. By a young age he had already succumbed to radicalism and is given as the secretary of the Hackney Branch of the Socialist League by around 1887. He would maintain links with the Socialist League, particularly helping with its publication Commonweal (which ran until about 1894) but by 1890 he had taken up a position in Leicester as a laster working in the boot and shoe trade. In is all too brief stay in Leicester he was responsible for unofficial strikes in the boot and shoe trade, organising Leicester’s first May Day demonstration in 1893 and becoming a delegate for the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives (NUBSO). George Cores is unfortunately remembered for a running feud he held with Thomas Keell, his directorship of Freedom and later his own publication, the Freedom Bulletin. Arguments between the two manifested as early as 1915, but would continue well into 1930’s when the Freedom group was becoming moribund and Keell reduced the scope of the paper and decided to move its publication away outside London to Whiteway Colony near Stroud in Gloucestershire. The dispute between Keell and Cores was divisive and while Cores had nominal backing from the likes of Meltzer and John Turner, the matter would not be clearly resolved until the various short runs and split publications ran their course and Vernon Richards reinvigorated the Freedom group with his merger from Spain and the World."

  "text" : "Gilbert LaFreniere (born 1934 in New York) is an American ecological philosopher, active in the study of geology, ecology, and human impact upon nature. Gilbert attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst and earned a Masters of Geology from Dartmouth College before completing a Ph.D in intellectual history from the University of California at Santa Barbara, (UCSB) in 1976. LaFreniere taught geology, environmental ethics, and environmental history for more than twenty-five years at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon. He remains an active Professor Emeritus and continues to lecture on the transformation of natural landscapes by man, appearing at Willamette University, Portland State University, and Oregon State University in the last few years. Many of his lectures rely heavily on his own travels and photography of the national parks of Europe, New England, California, the Pacific Northwest, and Canada. LaFreniere is also a noted scholar of the work and thought of the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the Idea of Progress and appears in the Card Catalog of the Rousseau Library in Montmorency, France. Gilbert's most recent book is The Decline of Nature (2008). Among his other publications are the book Jean Jacques Rousseau and the Idea of Progress (1976) and articles in Environmental History Review, Agriculture and Human Values, and The Trumpeter."

After his victory at Lake Trasimene, Hannibal sent Maharbal (leading a detachment of spearmen and cavalry), who successfully intercepted Centenius and his detachment of 4000 cavalry. Maharbal's force killed half of Centenius's men. The surviving Roman cavalry were followed to a hill, where they eventually surrendered. Titus Livius gives little information, except that the defeat occurred in Umbria. Appian says he was sent to the Plestine lake to occupy the routes for the Romans troops at the valley and was subsequently defeated by Hannibal. Zonaras says he was ambushed near Spoletium."

A graduate of Fisk University, he earned a master's degree at Yale University, and was the first African American to earn a doctorate degree from Columbia University, where he completed one in sociology. During the Woodrow Wilson administration, Haynes was appointed in 1918 as director of the newly established Division of Negro Economics in the Department of Labor, as part of an effort by the Democratic administration to build support from blacks for the war effort. (They had been disfranchised by Democratic-dominated state governments across the South around the turn of the 20th century). Haynes was one of the first analysts to write about black labor economics. He later founded the Social Sciences Department of Fisk University. Born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, he moved with his mother and sister to New York City during the Great Migration, and lived and worked from there for most of his life."

He taught Calligraphy in the Royal College of Teramo, but in 1820 he was dismissed because he was suspected of seditious Carboneria connections. He moved to Naples in 1822, where he attended the Academy of Fine Arts, and studied under Giuseppe Cammarano. He became a teacher in various schools in that city. He married in 1832 one of his pupils Adelaide Mazza. Among his works are a Death of Abel (1837) displayed at the 1837 Exhibition of Fine Arts in Naples. Infancy of Bacchus and Marriage of Bacchus and Ariadne were exhibited both in 1841. Among his other canvases are The four gifts of Poets ; an Immaculate Conception for the private chapel of the Marchese Tommasi; St Paul; Solon in the Aereopagus; Coriolanus near the Volsci; and a Charon transporting souls. He painted the Renunciation of the Crown of Naples by Frederick of Naples. He painted an altarpiece of St Bernard, patron of the city, for the Sacristy of the Cathedral of Teramo. Among his portraits are ones of the Prince of Fondi, the Marchese Tommasi of Naples, The Greek Princesses Ipsilanti and Kantakouzene, and Prince Ghica of Moldavia. He also painted self-portraits found at the Pinacoteca of Teramo and of Macerata. Among his pupils were Achille Vertunni, Filippo Palizzi  and Francesco Nétti. He died from typhus in 1851 in Naples, and his burial monument there contains a marble bust by Pasquale Ricca."

He is known for his treatise De vita contemplativa, also known as De Contemplatione. This has sometimes been attributed to Guigo I (d.1136), the fifth prior of the Grande Chartreuse. However, it cannot have been written by Guigo I, because it refers to several writings of thirteenth-century scholastic theology, as well as to Hugh of Balma's Viae Syon Lugent. Part of it (Book II, chapters 1-5) was taken up nearly verbatim by the fourteenth-century Carthusian Ludolph of Saxony (d.1377) in his Vita Christi. One of those who read Ludolph was Ignatius of Loyola, so indirectly, Guigo's thought entered early modern Catholic spiritual writing. Though it was known and used by a number of late medieval Carthusians, though (as well as Ludolph of Saxony it is used by Denis of Rijkel, and possibly Nicholas Kempf), it survives in only five manuscripts, so was clearly not widely read outside these circles."

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1737, being sponsored as \"a gentleman well-skilled in mathematical knowledge and natural philosophy\". He rented Alkrington Hall from the Lever family before buying Hulme Hall as his residence. Lloyd sold Hulme Hall in 1764 to Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, who had to pay a large amount of money to acquire it so that he could continue construction of his eponymous canal. Lloyd later lived in York and, finally, in Barrowby, near Leeds, where he died on 4 December 1783. He was buried nearby at Swillington. Lloyd married twice, to Eleanor Wright and to Susannah Horton. With Eleanor he had a son, John, who was later elected FRS as his father had been. With Susannah he had sons called Gamaliel, George and Thomas, and daughters called Anne, Susannah and Elizabeth. Lloyd was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1779."

  "text" : "Gene Beery (born 1937) is an American painter and photographer, who has been described as an expressionist, Pop artist, Minimalist, and Conceptualist in the span of his fifty-plus years career. He is primarily known for his text based canvases, based on his conceit that words and the ideas they provoke can exist as works of art in themselves. Living and working in New York City in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Beery was at the center of the development of both Pop and Conceptual art. Since the 1990s, Beery has also worked as a photographer, intimately documenting his family, friends and life in a snapshot style, adding another dimension to our understanding of this unusual artist. He currently lives and works in Sutter Creek, California. Beery is represented by Greenspon in New York."

  "text" : "George Taylor (1914–1996)  was an English artist. He has prominence for his functional pub signs in a distinct hybrid modern-meets-traditional style. Taylor trained as a signwriter in Birmingham. In the 1930s he worked for a signwriting company in his native town Bromsgrove, where his commissions included designing film posters for the Rank Organisation. From 1941 to 1945, during World War II, he was sent to Cairo to work as a camouflage artist (painter). After the war, until his retirement in 1976, he was director of a silk-screen printing company in Surrey. He and his wife Sylvia then moved to Yorkshire and he painted over 100 pub signs for these businesses across that region. In 1984 his family moved to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk in which area he continued work for his most frequent client, the Greene King Brewery who are based there — he created more than 250 signs for Greene King pubs. He was main sign artist for a period for the Wem Brewing Company based in the market town of Wem in Shropshire. He died in January 1996. In 2008, his widow presented Greene King with a collection of his miniature, proof, pub sign designs, painted for the approval of clients before being copied as full-sized designs. They were put on exhibition in the brewhouse in his new hometown. In December 2011, she displayed some of his miniatures on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow programme."

  "text" : "Gu Xiancheng (Chinese: 顧憲成; pinyin: Gù Xiànchéng; 1550–1612) was a Ming dynasty Chinese bureaucrat and educator who founded the Donglin movement. He was born in Jiangnan, to a mercantile family, and from an early age was tutored in the Chinese classics. He quickly rejected the Yaojiang school of Wang Yangming, favouring the strong moral dichotomy of earlier Song philosophers such as Zhu Xi. A student of Xue Yingqi, he held office as Grand Secretary in the Imperial Court. Together with his brother and his student Gao Panlong he rebuilt the Donglin (\"East Forest\") Academy in 1604, in the town of Wuxi. The Donglin Charter was based on Zhu Xi's Articles of the White Deer Grotto, and incorporated quotations from a number of Confucian classics. Gu required prospective entrants to have four key qualities, which he called the Four Essentials: students had to consider their fundamental nature, show firm resolve, respect the Classics and scrutinise their own motivation. Gu's Academy quickly attracted a large student base, and became a rallying point for dissent and criticism of the government, in the form of the Donglin movement. The Academy was strongly critical of the notorious eunuch Wei Zhongxian, and as a result of Wei's persecution it was shut down in 1622; it reopened some years later after the eunuch's death."

  "text" : "Giovanni Battista Tassara (Genoa, June 23, 1841 - Genoa, October 5, 1916) was an Italian sculptor. As a young man he was apprenticed in the studio of the professor Nomagnino, where he stayed 6 or 7 months, tranferring to the studio of professor Giovanni Battista Cevasco. By 1860, Tassara joined the patriotic Expedition of the Thousand, and distinguished himself for valor. At Calatafimi, he was made corporal, and in Palermo seargent, receiving two honorable mentions and an honor for a wound to the right shoulder that damaged part of his scapula. One of his first works was a group of three figures: La morte di Schiaffino porta bandiera dei Mille a Calatafimi; the sculptural group Amori degli Angioli: a statue of Garibaldi sullo scoglio di Quarto; and a group depicting: The Baptism of Christ, now in the church of Santa Margherita Ligure; The Dream of a Virgin; and Una coppa, exhibited in Florence in 1871. Tassara completed many portrait busts of illustrious persons, among those of professors Ussi, Conti, Ongaro, Massimo D'Azeglio, Aleardi, and others. He was criticized for being to prolific. Among his other works, was a larger than life Moses for the Cemetery of Staglieno in Genoa; and a monument to Bellini for the Duomo of Catania. Tassara sculpted two statues, Aaron and Samuel, for the new facade of the Cathedral of Florence. In 1880, the House of Savoy commissioned from him a large statue of Neptune. He then moved to in Rome. He completed two large bas-reliefs, for the Ossuary of Calatafimi. Tassara, among his many honors, was nominated in 1867 honorary associate of the Accademia Raffaello of Urbino; in 1868, professor at the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence, and the next year of the Academy of Genoa. In 1883, he attempted to establish a factory for maiolica, but the business failed."

  "text" : "The Rev. George Fisher Linfield (1846-1890) was an American clergyman and educator. Linfield College in McMinnville, Oregon, was named in his honor. George Fisher Linfield was born September 6, 1846 at Randolph, Massachusetts. He was the son of John Porter Linfield and Louisa Fisher, both descended from early New England colonists. Linfield graduated from the University of Rochester, New York, in 1873 and from the Rochester Theological Seminary in 1876. He was ordained as a Baptist minister January 4, 1877 in Moline, Illinois, where he served as pastor from 1876 to 1881. He was pastor at Muscatine, Iowa in 1881 and 1882. He served as the principal of Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin from 1882 to 1890. The Rev. Linfield died April 30, 1890 in Beaver Dam, Dodge County, Wisconsin, and was buried there in Oakwood Cemetery. George Fisher Linfield married Frances Eleanor Ross December 4, 1878 in Illinois. Mr. and Mrs. Linfield had had one son, Ross Linfield, who was born May 8, 1883 in Muscatine, Iowa. Ross died in infancy and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery at Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. During their tenure at Wayland Academy, George and Frances agreed that they should dedicate their life savings to promote Christian education. This purpose was realized in 1922, when Mrs. Linfield gifted real estate she owned in Spokane, Washington, valued at $250,000, to McMinnville College in McMinnville, Oregon, a Baptist institution. In honor of the gift, the college changed its name to Linfield College after the Rev. George F. Linfield."

  "text" : "George Cannons full name George Frederic Cannons was a Hollywood portrait photographer of the 1930s. Professionally known as Cannons of Hollywood. Cannons worked in both Hollywood and London. George Cannons was born in 1897 and went to Hollywood after the Great War. His reputation as a stills photographer was first established during the silent film period working for Mack Sennett and specialised in portraits of Sennett's bathing beauties. In the early 1930s he continued working in Hollywood with portraits of leading stars including Dolores Del Rio and Jean Harlow. After returning to England in 1934 he set up his own studio in Dover Street in central London known as Cannons of Hollywood and exploited his Hollywood credentials and specialised in glamour portraits. Cannons found work hard to come by due to the number of established photographers in London’s West End. This led Cannons to seek work as a stills photographer for J. Arthur Rank who was based at Pinewood Studios and he was assigned to work with Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger on two of their finest films. In 1946 he created the colour portraits of Jean Simmons during the filming of Black Narcissus. These images were featured in film annuals like Film Review by F. Maurice Speed. In 1948 he was promoted to the position of principal stills photographer on The Red Shoes and responsible for the iconic stills of Moira Shearer during the ballet sequence. His publicity portraits of Moira Shearer, Anton Walbrook, Leonide Massine and Ludmilla Tcherina for The Red Shoes are also particularly striking. This undoubtedly elevated his career and along with Fred Daniels he was credited as the best portrait photographer to work with Powell and Pressburger. He continued to work for the Rank Organisation and in 1949 he took a series of portraits of Valerie Hobson which are in the National Portrait Gallery collection in London. He died in 1972."

  "text" : "Giulio Branca (December 15, 1851- February 28, 1926) was an Italian sculptor, active mainly in Milan. He was born in Cannobio, a Lombard town on Lago Maggiore. As a boy, he showed inclination to become an artist. His father Lodovico wanted him to study commerce, but he filled his school books with drawings of soldiers and battles. After a severe illness, his parents relented and allowed him to study art, initially locally under the sculptor Bergonzoli. At 14 years of age, he left of Milan, where he had studied for five years, including two years under the professor Giovanni Strazza. One of his first works was Monello di campagna (Young Grape-harvester), displayed at the 1873 Viennese Esposition. Other works include a life-size marble statue of Louis XVII, displayed at the 1878 Universal Exposition of Paris; and of Rosmunda al banchetto di Alboino, displayed in 1880 in Turin and awarded a silver medal in the 1883 International Exposition of Amsterdam. He also sculpted the Monument (1884) for the Cazzaniga family in the cemetery of Pavia, and The Apotheosis of the Soul for the monument to Giovanni Norsa in Milan's Main Cemetery, and the monument to the Memory of Carlo Rossi at the same cemetery. The city of Cannobio commissioned from him a larger than life statue of Senator Antonio Giovagnola. He also made a bust of Paolo Ferrari. Branca became a prominent sculptor in Lombardy. During 1897-1900, he participated in the continual restorations of the Cathedral of Milan. He was decorated with the Order of the Crown of Italy. In 1894, he completed an Ave Maria inspired by Millet and displayed at the second Triennale of the Brera Academy. In 1898 in Turin, he displayed l'Addio dello Spazzacamino (Chimney sweep's Goodbye); in 1906, Voice of Conscience was displayed at the Universal Exposition of Milan; and Ciceronis finis was displayed at the 1915 Brera Triennial. In Cannobio, he is also remembered for his 1884 Monument to the patriots of May 27–28, 1859  and in Traffiume, a neighborhood of this town, for his Monument to the Fallen (erected 1920). In the gardens of the Archive of the State in Pallanza is conserved the bust of Carlo Cavallini (1886)."

  "text" : "Gauri Ayyub (1931 – 1998) was a social worker, activist, writer and teacher based in Kolkata (Calcutta) for most of her life. Married to the philosopher and literary critic, Abu Sayeed Ayyub (1906–1982), Gauri was a writer in her own right, and is known for her short stories, translations, and numerous articles on social issues. She is recognised for her role in the propagation of communal harmony in Bengal, active assistance to the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 and vocal opposition to the curbing of human rights during the declaration of emergency in India in 1974. She assisted writer and social worker Maitreyi Devi in founding Khelaghar, initially as a shelter for Bangladeshi children orphaned during the war of 1971. After Maitreyi Devi died in 1990, Ayyub took charge of Khelaghar and it still runs as an orphanage that follows the educational principles of Rabindranath Tagore, emphasising holistic development of children in a natural surrounding. Gauri Ayyub studied philosophy at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan and education at the University of Calcutta. During 1963–91, she was a professor and later the head of the department of education at the Shri Shikshayatan College, an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta. Though stricken with rheumatoid arthritis early in her life, she carried on her numerous activities in spite of often severe pain and disability, in addition to caring for her ailing husband, bedridden for the last decade of his life."

  "text" : "Gwen Cooper is a New York City-based American novelist and author of the 2009 New York Times bestselling memoir Homer’s Odyssey: A Fearless Feline Tale, or How I Learned about Love and Life with a Blind Wonder Cat, a memoir about her life with an abandoned, eyeless cat that she rescued when he was three weeks old and subsequently named Homer. In 2007, Simon & Schuster published Cooper’s first novel, Diary of a South Beach Party Girl, inspired in part by Cooper’s own experiences living and working in Miami’s trendy South Beach in the late 1990s. Cooper’s third book, Love Saves the Day, a novel told from the point of view of a cat named Prudence, was published by Random House in January, 2013. Set in both New York City’s Lower East Side during the 1970s/1980s and on the present-day Upper West Side, the novel takes its name from two inspirations: The Love Saves The Day vintage store located on Manhattan's East Village and from the “Love Saves The Day” gatherings of the early 1970s, well-known underground parties that were the proving ground of Dee-Jays and modern dance music."

  "text" : "Giovanni Davide Maderna (Milan, 1973) is an Italian film director. In 1995 Maderna directed his first short film, La Place, in Lyon, France, equal winner at Nanni Moretti's Sacher Festival. After a few other shorts in 1999 his first feature film This is the garden (Questo è il giardino) won the Luigi De Laurentiis Prize for Best Debut Film at Venice Film Festival (and was hailed by french newspaper Liberation as the work of the new Antonioni). Then he directed Imperfect Love (L'amore imperfetto, 2001) which also premiered at Venice Film Festival. With his films Schopenhauer (2006, in competition at Locarno Film Festival) and four years later Heaven without Earth (\"Cielo senza terra\" 2010, Festival di Venezia in Competition at Venice Days), co-directed with Sara Pozzoli, he started a season in quest of a deep renovation of cinematographic language, striving to merge very different and apparently inconsistent influences. It is an attempt to drive filmmaking to a clear simplicity, releasing it from both contemporary realism and patronising author's approach. He overtly quotes as source of inspiration directors Robert Bresson, Alberto Grifi and Otar Iosseliani, but also hollywood helmers Leo McCarey and Preston Sturges. He founded the production company Quarto Film and since 2007 worked with authors such as Francesco Gatti, Dario Buccino, Filippo Ticozzi, Sara Pozzoli, Mauro Santini, Tonino De Bernardi and Giovanni Cioni. In 2005 he dedicated a video-interview (conducted with Antonio Moresco) to the great Italian experimental film-maker Alberto Grifi. In 2012 he curated the independent section at Venice Film Festival \"Cinema Corsaro\", a selection of works marked by an unconventional and experimental approach to both production and direction. In this occasion he presented his new film Carmela, saved by Buccaneers, co-directed with Mauro Santini and part of a series of experimental films loosely based on Emilio Salgari's \"Jolanda, la figlia del Corsaro Nero\". Look Love Lost (2012) is a film made with private footage recorded over a few years and edited in a single session on Christmas Day 2011. In 2015 founded the London based production company El Entertainment Ltd, named after Luis Bunuel's \"El\"."

Kraft was born in Nuremberg, and with the encouragement of the Elector Palatine, Johann Wilhelm, trained in Italy under the composer and violinist Arcangelo Corelli. On his return, he served as the concert master of the court orchestra in Düsseldorf and composed the ballet music for several operas by his friend Johann Hugo von Wilderer, another composer at Johann Wilhelm's court. He also performed at the coronation of emperor Charles VI at Frankfurt am Main in 1711. When Charles Philip became Elector Palatine on the death of his brother Johann Wilhelm, he moved his court to Heidelberg. Kraft retired as a court musician in 1716 rather than move to Heidelberg. On his retirement, his son, Sebastian Johannes, took over his musical position. Kraft died in Kaster, a district in the city of Bedburg on 1 December 1726."

The denial of his admission became a Supreme Court case, In re Anastaplo, in which he insisted that the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the privacy of political affiliations; in particular, he refused to answer questions about membership in the Communist Party. Anastaplo's stand was based on Constitutional principles and consequent rejection of McCarthyism, and nobody alleged that he had membership in the Communist Party. The Supreme Court's majority upheld the lower courts' ruling in favor of the Illinois Bar, although Justice Hugo Black dissented. After his Supreme Court case and denial of admission to the Bar, Anastaplo supported his family by teaching at the University of Chicago and other universities and colleges. He wrote many articles and books on philosophy, many of which acknowledged the influence of his teacher, Leo Strauss."

  "text" : "Gustav von Bunge (19 January 1844, Dorpat – 5 November 1920, Basel) was a German physiologist known for work in the field of nutrition physiology. He was the son of botanist Alexander Bunge (1803–1890). In 1874 he received his degree in chemistry at the University of Dorpat, followed by a doctorate in medicine at the University of Leipzig in 1882. At Dorpat, he had as instructors, Friedrich Bidder (1810–1894) and Carl Schmidt (1822–1894). In 1885 he became an associate professor, and from 1886 until his death in 1920, he served as a professor of physiological chemistry at the University of Basel. Among his more important studies were the interplay of potassium and sodium within the body; the association of sodium chloride with metabolism, and analytic studies of iron metabolism. He was the author of treatises on alcoholic spirits, of which he denounced as a \"threat to health and heredity\". His name is associated with \"Bunge's rule\", a nutritional law based on his research of human and animal milk – \"that nutrients in milk are proportional to the growth of the offspring\"."

  "text" : "George Wylie Easton (1883–1966) was a Scottish businessman, footballer and sportsperson. He lived in Finland from the early 1900s to 1939 and worked on the timber trade. Easton was an enthusiast sportsman who was interested in football, athletics and curling. In 1903 Easton moved to Western Finnish coastal town of Jakobstad and three years later to neighboring Kokkola introducing football to both towns. The first football match in Kokkola was played between the crew of a British merchant ship and the local voluntary fire brigade. In 1908 Easton won the first Finnish championship title with Unitas Sports Club. He played and coached the rest of his career for Reipas of Vyborg. Easton was also a talented sprinter. His record on 100 metres run was 10.8 (1910) and on 200 metres 23.4 (1910). Easton's record on 200 metres was 0.2 seconds better than the Finnish record of that time. His unofficial record on 100 metres is said to be 10.4. Easton participated the Finnish Championships in Athletics but was not awarded since he did not hold the Finnish citizenship. In 1909 Easton introduced curling to Finland. He acquired the equipment from British engineers working at the Putilov gun plant in St. Petersburg. The first official match was held a year later in Vyborg as the local club Reipas played against English Curling Club of Moscow."

  "text" : "Gian Paolo Barbieri (or Giampaolo Barbieri) (born 1938) is an Italian fashion photographer. Born on the Via Mazzini in Milan, Barbieri's family were fabric wholesalers, and his father owned a department store. He performed in amateur dramatics in the mid-1950s, forming \"The Trio\", a performance troupe with his friends. Barbieri also had a non-speaking role in Luchino Visconti's film Medea. He was influenced by cinema at an early age and photographed models in 1960s Rome, part of the social scene that was portrayed in Federico Fellini's 1960 film La Dolce Vita. A self-taught photographer, his first professional work was an apprenticeship to the Harper's Bazaar photographer Tom Kublin, who died twenty days later. In 1963 Barbieri had some images published in the Italian fashion magazine Novità, which became Vogue Italia in 1965. Barbieri also shot for the American and French editions of Vogue. The role of fashion editor had not been fully created in the 1960s, and Barbieri had to find the best setting for his photographs and create the hairstyles, makeup, and jewellery. This could led to the use of unusual materials, a notable example being earrings made with table tennis balls painted in a mother-of-pearl colour. Barbieri opened his own studio in Milan in 1964, and began to work closely with ready-to-wear fashion designers a few years later. His creative relationship with Walter Albini led to an appreciation of the role of the stylist, and Barbieri and the fashion designer Valentino were responsible for innovations in modern fashion advertising campaigns. Notable models that Barbieri has photographed include Mirella Petteni, Jerry Hall, Veruschka, Monica Bellucci and Audrey Hepburn. Barbieri has worked for fashion designers Armani, Versace and Ferré, and Dolce & Gabbana, Pomellato, and Giuseppe Zanotti. In the 1990s Barbieri became a travel photographer. An exhibition of Barbieri's work was curated by the English fashion photographer David Bailey, shown at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Kunstforum in Vienna. Barbieri photographs in analog and does not retouch his pictures. One of his early cameras was a Reflex Voigtländer 35mm. In 1968 he was awarded the Biancamano Prize as Best Italian Photographer and was named one of the 14 best international fashion photographers by the German magazine Stern in 1978."

Born in Beauvais, Galon became Abbot of Saint-Quentin, later enthroned a bishop thanks to the papal support of Paschal II. As a legate he supervised the course of Gregorian reform in the Polish Church. He summoned a council that deposed two bishops for disobeying the Canons including Cracovian Cazlaus (Czasław), who had married. Galon was also first to bring to Poland the canon law collection Collectio trium partium, a work of his master St. Ivo, medieval canonist and Bishop of Chartres. Galon was present at Council of Châlons in 1115. He died February 23, 1116."

She gained notoriety in 2012 after a video shot on a hidden camera was released, featuring Ahmadova negotiating a bribe sum with lawyer and fellow party member Elshad Abdullayev to help arrange, among other things, his election to the Azerbaijani parliament. The corruption scandal which ensued became known as Gulargate (by analogy with the Watergate scandal) and led to Ahmadova's stepping down as an MP and later arrest and expulsion from the party. She was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzlement and failure to report a grave offence, but her prison term was suspended 14 months into the sentence."

  "text" : "Giuseppe Bellenghi (Bologna 1847-Florence Oct 17, 1902) was a virtuoso violincellist and mandolinist, and a composer. He was remembered in 1914 as \"a devoted champion of the mandolin.\" Bellinghi studied violincello under \"several well-known Italian masters,\" including Teodulo and Jefte Sbolci. He gained a reputation as a cello virtuoso in Florence, and worked in important concerts in Bologna and Florence, and as first violincellist in the theatres. He taught the violoncello as well, and cellist Elvira Paoli was one of his students. While teaching violoncello, Bellenghi \"became enamored of the mandolin,\" which was in fashion at the time with the aristocracy and nobility in Italy. He worked to spread its popularity further. He began to perform in concerts as a mandolinist between 1880 and 1900. Bellenghi organized concerts in Florence and Bologna, where \"celebrated mandolinists, Riccardo Rovinazzi, Giuseppe Silvestri, and Caroline Grimaldi took part.\" He was also one of three teachers to be given the privilege of teaching the mandolin to Princess Margherita of the Royal family of Italy; Belisario Mattera and Constantino Bertucci also received that honor. He began to write for the mandolin, creating \"light selections.\" He first published with Ricordi in Milan, but later founded Forlivesi & Company Publishing in Florence, which was a major music publisher when he died in 1902, publishing more than 7000 musical compositions. Bellenghi's own compositions were very numerous, and he published many lighter works under the name of G. B. Pirani. He wrote the comprehensive Method for the mandolin in three parts, which is published in four languages, French, English, Italian and German. He also wrote a series of daily exercises for the mandolin, entitled La ginnastica del mandolino, with the object of strengthening the fourth finger, and a volume of Ascending and descending major and minor scales in all positions for the mandolin. He wrote Six duos for two mandolins and a Theoretical treatise on the rudiments of music. In addition to his mandolin books, Bellenghi was the first to write and publish a method for the modern lute, and under the name G. B. Pirani, methods for mandola and guitar. The most popular of his compositions were the waltzes Profumi Orientali and Renato, both of which rapidly passed many editions. When it was published, Renato was \"the foremost composition for mandolin band\". Profumi Orientali was also arranged by its author as a song with French, Italian, and English words. Bellenghi wrote many pieces for piano solo and two pianos, songs with piano or guitar accompaniments, and about seventy various arrangements and original compositions for mandolin band. He also wrote about fifty similar works for guitar solo. He wrote a set of Variations for the mandolin with accompaniment of piano or guitar—variations of Paganini's variations on the Carnival of Venice. Biographer Philp J. Bone said that \"this work alone, places Bellenghi in the foremost rank as a mandolin virtuoso and thorough artist on the instrument, who enlarged its scope and extended its musical possibilities, as nothing of so advanced a nature for the mandolin had been published hitherto.\" Bellinghi died when he was 55. His music publish business was continued by his son, Renato Bellenghi."

He is principally remembered today for his role as a mandolinist and for his composition Serenade d'Autrefois (Serenata medioevale or Serenade of Olden Times). He was a celebrated teacher of the mandolin in Naples and Paris, and became popular enough to get the criticism that he was causing Parisians to leave the piano for the mandolin.

His chief works were the operas L'Italienne and Pierre et Lucette, the former being an opera bouffe in one act (with the storyline or libretto by Nicolas-Étienne Framery). These works were commissioned by the Comedie Italienne, Paris, and were produced at this theatre successfully, in 1770 and 1774. Several of the songs and duets in Pierre and Lucette were exceedingly popular in France, and they were republished in Paris in 1775 and 1780."

  "text" : "George J. F. Clarke (October 12, 1774 – 1836) was one of the most prominent and active men of East Florida in the Second Spanish Period. As a friend and trusted advisor of the Spanish governors of the province from 1811 to 1821, he was appointed to several public offices under the colonial regime, including that of surveyor general. Clarke served in the Spanish militia from 1800 to 1821, defending East Florida in the \"Patriot War\" of 1812 and leading militia forces against the freebooters Gregor MacGregor and Louis-Michel Aury in 1817. By the order of Governor Enrique White he platted the town of Fernandina in 1811 and oversaw the construction of new buildings there. He was a central figure in organizing a local government in the area between the St. Marys and St. Johns rivers, which brought a workable peace to that tumultuous section during the final years of Spanish rule. Clarke knew the geography of the region better than any other person of his time, as his office was responsible for every land survey made in East Florida between 1811 and 1821. Clarke profited from the acquisition and resale of large tracts of land, and his landholdings were among the largest in Florida. In his will he distributed more than 33,000 acres to his heirs, as well as several houses and scattered lots. He spoke Spanish fluently, but his writing in the language was ungrammatical. His initials have been given incorrectly by many historians as I. F., confusion arising because the capital Is and Js of his handwriting were indistinguishable. His will shows his given name to have been George John Frederic Clarke. In his later years he invented a horse-driven sawmill, practicable enough that the Spanish Governor José Coppinger granted him a \"sawmill grant\" of 22,000 acres of timbered land, although the customary such grant was for 16,000 acres. Clarke published his opinions on a wide array of subjects in the provincial newspaper, the East Florida Herald, including experimental agriculture, fruit tree cultivation, diet and health, archeology, and the white man's relations with the Indians."

  "text" : "Guo Hongwei is a contemporary artist based in Beijing. He was born in 1982 and graduated from the Oil Painting Department of Sichuan Fine Arts Institute in 2004. After graduation, Guo did not follow the traditional route of academic painting. He turned to discover a new creation mode which is based on his childhood memories. Usually,he takes inspiration from old photographs. He is known primarily for his watercolor series. In his recent works, he ventured into the field of collage and started to explore and to experiment with new dimensions in visual art within a given flat surface. “From the physical perspective, Guo’s practice neither bolsters nor weakens the informational capacity of the 2D print medium—he simply recodes it.” Guo Hongwei has exhibited at a number of venues. In 2013, Guo appeared at UCCA in the group exhibition ON | OFF:China’s Young Artists in Concept and Practice. His works were also shown at Shanghai Zendai MoMA (2007 and 2006), Today ArtMuseum (2007) and Shanghai Biennale(2012), etc."

  "text" : "Gloria M. Coruzzi (born June 28, 1954) is an American molecular biologist specializing in plant systems biology and evolutionary genomics. As Carroll & Milton Petrie Professor of Biology at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, Coruzzi studies gene regulatory networks controlling nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and root nutrient foraging in the model plant Arabidopsis. She also examines phylogenomic approaches across higher plant species to identify genes associated with the evolution of key plant traits such as seeds. This research resides in Pasteur's quadrant as scientific investigation that is ultimately meant to be beneficial to society. Coruzzi has established 10 patents in the study of gene networks affecting nitrogen use efficiency. Her laboratory collaborated in the development of the software platform VirtualPlant (www.virtualplant.org). As an investigator on the National Science Foundation (NSF) Plant Genome project she helped generate the largest genome-scale phylogeny of the seed plants, which allows researchers to explore the genomic underpinnings of plant diversity Coruzzi is from New York. She took her Bachelor of Science in biology cum laude from Fordham University in 1976. For studies of the genetic code in yeast mitochondrial DNA she earned her Ph.D. in molecular and cell biology at NYU School of Medicine in 1979. In a post-doctoral National Institutes of Health (NIH) fellowship, she applied molecular approaches to plants that contributed to the cloning of one of the first plant nuclear genes. As an associate professor at Rockefeller University, Coruzzi identified key genes controlling the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into key amino acids used for nitrogen transport in plants. Coruzzi took a position as a professor at NYU in 1993. Her lab has constructed of the first integrated genomic network used to discover and validate nitrogen regulation of the circadian clock in plants. It predicted the function of gene network states under untested conditions. Coruzzi has authored and coauthored over 120 research papers  and served as chair of the Department of Biology at NYU from 2003 to 2011. Her research is funded by the National Institutes of Health, NSF 2010 Project, NSF Plant Genome Project, the NSF Database and Information Project, and United States Department of Energy.. Coruzzi was named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2005, a Fellow of the American Society of Plant Biology in 2010, and a Fellow of the Agropolis Foundation in 2012. She currently serves on the International Arabidopsis Informatics Consortium (IAIC) Scientific Board and the Scientific Advisory Board of The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center."

  "text" : "Geoffrey Davis (died 3 October 2008) was an Australian doctor and director of the International Abortion Research and Training Centre. In the early 1960s Davis had two clinics in the Potts Point and Arncliffe suburbs of Sydney where he carried out discreet terminations up until 1971, when abortion was legalised in New South Wales. Though Davis was originally an anaesthetist, he is known for his work with late term abortions. Davis had worked with Population Services International, the International Fertility Research Program, and International Planned Parenthood Federation in the 1960s. Davis also did research on prior induced abortion. Davis is best known for his work in performing late-term abortions following the mass rapes during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Davis worked in a victim relief programme in Bangladesh in the year following the liberation war at the request of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation. In conjunction with Leonard Laufe, Davis set up in Dhaka \"industrial scale procedures\" of abortion in the year following the war. Between them they carried out 95 percent of terminations which had resulted from the mass rapes. Davis also travelled for months in remote areas to carry out terminations. Davis has estimated that up to 400,000 women and children had been raped by the Pakistani armed forces and their collaborators, the Al-Badr (\"the moon\") the Al-Shams (\"the sun\") and the Razakars. In addition to carrying out terminations Davis also worked with international adoption agencies in trying to find families for the children who were unwanted due to cultural beliefs. Davis died on 3 October 2008 in Australia."

  "text" : "George Alder Blumer, M.D. (1857-1940) was a physician, a mental hospital administrator, and a journal editor. He was a leader in the provision of humanitarian care for mental hospital patients. Blumer was born in Sunderland, England. His father was a physician as were his two brothers. His early education in England was followed by schooling in Germany and France. In 1874, he entered the medical school at the University of Edinburgh and remained for one year before he emigrated to the United States. He completed his medical degree at the University of Pennsylvania and graduated in 1879. After a residency of one year at Lankenau Hospital in Philadelphia, he obtained a post of assistant physician at the New York State Lunatic Asylum (also known as the New York State Inebriate Asylum) in Utica, New York, under the superintendency of John P. Gray, M.D., a prominent psychiatrist. Gray died in 1886 and Blumer became the superintendent of Utica. Blumer instituted many reforms at Utica. He abolished all forms of patient restraints, improved living conditions for patients, placed women nurses on male wards, established occupations and amusements for patients, and succeeded in officially changing the name of the institution to Utica State Hospital. In 1890, the New York State legislature established a State Commission on Lunacy with the director to be responsible for the administration of the state mental hospitals. The Commission of two lay members and a chief psychiatrist began to follow the legislature’s charge but encountered opposition from the state hospital superintendents who, until then, exercised total control of their institutions. It was an ongoing struggle between the Commission and the superintendents, and Blumer took an active role. Blumer’s struggle with the Commission included the Commission’s attempt to take over the leading psychiatric publication in the United States, the American Journal of Insanity. The journal had been established and edited by Amariah Brigham, the first superintendent at Utica and was owned by the hospital. An earlier court ruling confirmed that the hospital owned the journal. Blumer arranged for the American Medico-Psychological Association, now the American Psychiatric Association, to purchase the journal and publish it as the Journal of the American Psychiatric Association, which continues today. As editor of the American Journal of Insanity, Blumer influenced the psychiatric community. He remained an editor emeritus of the journal until he died. In 1899, he accepted the post of Superintendent of the private Butler Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island where he remained until his retirement in 1921. Blumer remained in Providence after retirement and was named Superintendent Emeritus of Butler. Blumer was elected president of the American Psychiatric Association from 1903 to 1904. His presidential address dealt with the politicization of state mental hospitals, eugenics, and the role of immigration relating to state hospital missions. While at Butler, Blumer participated in numerous community organizations. He was president of the Providence Athenaeum in Rhode Island, a trustee of the Rhode Island School of Design, president of the Rhode Island Historical Society, on the Board of Visitors at Brown University, and director of the State Mental Hygiene Society. Blumer received honorary degrees from Brown University (L.H.D., 1905) and from Hamilton College (L.H.D. 1921). He was named an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1921 by Brown University. He died in 1940."

  "text" : "George Hughes Kirby (1875-1935) was an American physician and psychiatrist, administrator, and educator, who contributed to the advancement of psychiatry in the United States. Kirby was born in Goldsboro, North Carolina, the son of a physician who was superintendent of the state mental hospital in Goldsboro. He attended the public schools of Goldsboro, then enrolled in the University of North Carolina, earned his nomination to Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated with a B.A. in 1896. His medical training was at the Long Island College Hospital in New York, and he earned his M.D. in 1899. He worked under Adolph Meyer at the Worcester State Hospital in Massachusetts. In 1902, when Meyer became director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, located on Wards Island, Kirby went with him and was hired at the Manhattan State Hospital. In 1908, Kirby was appointed director of Clinical Psychiatry at the Manhattan State Hospital. During his years with Meyer, Kirby went to Germany and studied with Emil Kraepelin, professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Munich. While at the Manhattan State Hospital, Kirby developed a classification of psychoses which was expanded as a statistical guide for use in the New York State mental hospitals. The American Psychiatric Association adopted Kirby's classification. He also developed staff education courses for use in state mental hospitals. In 1917, the New York State Hospital Commission appointed Kirby as medical inspector, but after four months he left this position to assume the directorship of the New York State Psychiatric Institute when Meyer left. Kirby was an active participant in planning the move of the New York State Psychiatric Institute from Wards Island to the Columbia University Medical Center and he was involved in the construction of the new building. He held the post of director until he retired in 1931. During World War I, Kirby was a Major in the U.S. Army and commanded the hospital established in New York City to care for mentally disabled soldiers. The U.S. Public Health Service appointed him as a consultant. Kirby served as a professor of psychiatry at several medical schools in New York: from 1914 to1919, he was Adjunct Professor of Mental Diseases at New York University and Bellevue Medical College; from 1917 to 1932, he was professor of psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College; and from 1927 to 1932 he was professor of psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. Kirby played an active role in numerous professional organizations: the New York Neurological Society (president), the American Neurological Association, the American Psychopathological Association, the American Psychiatric Association (president, 1933–34), the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry, the New York Academy of Medicine, and the Board of Directors of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. He served on numerous editorial boards including those of the American Journal of Psychiatry and Psychiatric Quarterly. The University of North Carolina honored him with an L.L.D. in 1929. Kirby died in 1935 while on vacation in New Hampshire."

He established Write's World Business Directory in Boston and later returned to Halifax and invested in the city. His own house at 989 Young Ave, and two of his public buildings, the Marble Wright Building (1672 Barrington St.) and The Saint Paul Building, (1684 Barrington St., formerly the home of JW Doull’s bookstore) still stand in downtown Halifax. They were all built by architect James Charles Philip Dumaresq. He was a philanthropist who developed the first housing project in the province. He left in his will his house to the Local Council of Women of Halifax to further the cause of women's suffrage (women's right to vote was achieved six years after Wright's death). He also was one of the large contributors to the Y.M.C.A. building fund and Dalhousie University. An enthusiastic yachtsman, Wright owned several boats in including the sloop Princess, built by H.W. Embree and Sons in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia. Wright also created the George Wright Cup, a racing trophy for sail races at the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron. Although his body was never found, he has a grave marker in the Christ Church cemetery in Dartmouth."

  "text" : "Grace White Sherwood (c. 1660 – c. 1740), known as the Witch of Pungo, is the last person known to have been convicted of witchcraft in Virginia. A farmer, healer, and midwife, she was accused by her neighbors of transforming herself into a cat, damaging crops and causing the death of livestock. She was charged with witchcraft several times; at her eventual trial in 1706, Sherwood was accused of bewitching Elizabeth Hill, causing Hill to miscarry. The court ordered that Sherwood's guilt or innocence be determined by ducking her in water. If she sank, she was innocent; if she did not, she was guilty. Sherwood floated to the surface and may have subsequently spent up to eight years in jail before being released. Sherwood lived in Pungo, Princess Anne County (today part of Virginia Beach), and married James Sherwood, a planter, in 1680. The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard. The elder James died in 1701; Grace Sherwood inherited his property and never remarried. Sherwood's first case was in 1697; she was accused of casting a spell on a bull, resulting in its death, but the matter was dismissed by the agreement of both parties. The following year she was accused of witchcraft by two neighbors; she supposedly bewitched the hogs and cotton crop of one of them. Sherwood sued for slander after each accusation but her lawsuits were unsuccessful and her husband had to pay court costs. In 1706 she was convicted of witchcraft and was incarcerated. Freed from prison by 1714, she recovered her property from Princess Anne County, after which she lived on her farm until her death in 1740 at the age of about 80. On July 10, 2006, the 300th anniversary of Sherwood's conviction, Governor Tim Kaine restored her good name, recognizing that her case was a miscarriage of justice. A statue depicting her was erected near Sentara Bayside Hospital on Independence Boulevard in Virginia Beach, close to the site of the colonial courthouse where she was tried. She is sculpted alongside a raccoon, representing her love of animals, and carrying a basket containing garlic and rosemary, in recognition of her knowledge of herbal healing."

  "text" : "Monsignor Giuseppe Placido Maria Nicolini O.S.B. (1877–1973), born Villazzano, Italy, was the Roman Catholic Bishop of Assisi from 1928 until 1973. Prior to serving as Bishop, he was ordained as a Benedictine priest in 1899 and was appointed Abbot of Santissima Trinità di Cava de’ Tirreni, Italy in 1919. During World War II, he established the Assisi Network which provided shelter to hundreds of Jews. When the Nazis began rounding up Jews during the Nazi Occupation of Italy, Nicolini ordered Father Aldo Brunacci to lead a rescue operation, which became known as the Assisi Network. Nicolini authorized the hiding of Jews in places that were regularly closed to outsiders by monastic regulations and his \"Committee of Assistance\" transformed Assisi into a shelter for many Jews, while assisting others to pass safely through the town to other places of safety. Sheltering places were arranged in 26 monasteries and convents, and false papers for transit were provided. Nicolini was recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem in 1977."

  "text" : "Gaius Cassius Parmensis (born c. 74 BC; died 31 or 30 BC in Athens) was a Roman politician and a Latin writer of the late Roman Republic, who belonged to the circle of conspirators against Gaius Julius Caesar. Cassius Parmensis came from that branch of the Roman gens Cassia, that played an important role in the founding of the city of Parma on the Via Aemilia in the second century BC. The ancient commentaries of Horace note that he was a follower of the teachings of Epicurus. In the spring of 44 BC Cassius Parmensis participated in the assassination of Caesar by members of the Senate. In 43 BC, following the murder, he became a quaestor and built a fleet which supported Gaius Cassius Longinus against Publius Cornelius Dolabella off the coast of the province of Asia. At the same time he wrote a report to Cicero from Cyprus on the situation, which has been handed down in the latter's correspondence. In November of 43 Cassius Parmensis, like many other enemies of Caesar, was declared an outlaw (proscribed) by the triumvirate of Mark Antony, Octavian, and Lepidus. After the defeat of the party of the murderers of Caesar in the Battle of Philippi (autumn of 42 BC), he gathered the remaining military units and was able to bring himself and the undamaged fleet to safety for a while with Sextus Pompeius in Sicily. After the latter's defeat in the year 36 BC, he accompanied the fallen \"naval king\" to Asia Minor, in order to join Anthony during the final battles in Bithynia. Anthony and Octavian waged a propaganda attack with in part low blows and slanders which preceded the decisive military confrontation for autocratic rule in the Roman Empire. Cassius also took part with intense violent attacks against Caesar's heirs. He asserted that Octavian was of low descent, and was only named his heir due to a homosexual relationship with Caesar. Furthermore, he said that Octavian had wanted to make his only daughter Julia the consort of the rich but \"barbarous\" nobleman Koson of Dacia. In 31 BC, Cassius Parmensis fought under Anthony's command at the Battle of Actium. His flight from Octavian's revenge lasted a total of twelve years (which was longer than that of all the other conspirators) but after the fall of Anthony he finally lost every possibility of fleeing, since the adopted son of Caesar now ruled the entire Roman Empire. After the defeat at Actium, he fled to Athens, where, in 30 B.C. at the very latest, he was recognized as the last murderer of Caesar still living and was killed by Lucius Varus under Octavian's orders. As an author, Cassius Parmensis wrote tragedies, satires, elegies and epigrams, which, in Horace's opinion, were not insignificant. Unfortunately, none of his work has survived. We only know the titles of two tragedies, Thyestes and Brutus, the first of which was allegedly stolen by his murderer Varus. Thyestes was subsequently published as Varus's own work. The style of his letter to Cicero seems above all complicated and pedantic in its flatteries, but also demonstrates a good talent for military observation. As for the common assertion often referring to another location in Horace, that Cassius had been burned to death together with his works, it is probably a mix-up. Marcus Terentius Varro quotes a verse of Cassius; however, the same verse is also attributed in another place to the poet Lucius Accius: Nocte intempesta nostram devenit domum[Late at night he came into our home]"

  "text" : "Gary B. Myrick is Secretary for the Minority of the United States Senate. As Secretary for the Minority, Myrick is chief procedural advisor to the Senate Democratic Leader, Senator Harry Reid, and supervises the minority's reaction to the day-to-day Senate schedule. In so doing, he often works with the Secretary for the Majority, Laura Dove. Roll Call reporters and editors have repeatedly cited Myrick among leading Capitol Hill staffers. Myrick helped manage Senate passage of, among other things, the Water Resources Development Act of 2013, the 2013 Farm Bill, and the immigration reform bill of 2013. Myrick served as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Chief of Staff in the 110th and 111th Congresses. In this post, Myrick oversaw the Majority Leader’s staff and was responsible for helping craft policy, develop strategy, and conduct outreach on behalf of the Majority Leader and Democratic Caucus. The Senate elected Myrick Secretary for the Majority on January 5, 2011. After the Republicans took back the majority in the 2014 elections, Myrick moved from Secretary for the Majority to Secretary for the Minority. Myrick joined Senator Reid’s office in 2003, when Reid, then Senate Minority Whip, asked him to serve as his Floor Counsel. In this position, Myrick quickly became one of Senator Reid’s top aides, and in 2005 he was named Deputy Chief of Staff. Reid is the third Senate Democratic Leader for whom Myrick has worked. He started his Senate career as an intern for Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell while attending the University of Maine. After graduating, he moved to Washington, D.C., to work as a staff assistant in Senator Mitchell’s office and as a member of Mitchell’s Cloakroom staff. While working in the Democratic Cloakroom, Myrick attended night classes at the Washington College of Law at American University, earning a J.D. in 1995. When Mitchell retired in 1995, Gary joined the Senate Floor Staff under incoming Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. Myrick lives in Arlington, Virginia, with his wife, Lauren, and their son, Henry."

Over the course of more than 55 years he trained thousands of hypnotherapists globally with his Transforming Therapy™ methods, many of whom themselves wrote many books and created their own hypnotherapy training centers including Randal Churchill (Hypnotherapy Training Institute) and Charles Tebbetts."

  "text" : "George II Ghisi (Italian: Giorgio Ghisi; died c. 1344/5 or 1352) was a Latin feudal lord in medieval Greece, lord of Tinos and Mykonos and Triarch of Negroponte. He was the son of Bartholomew II Ghisi. In 1326/27, as part of his father's rapprochement with the Catalans of the Duchy of Athens, George married Simona of Aragon, the daughter of the Catalan vicar-general Alfonso Fadrique. As Simona's dowry, the Ghisi received half the castellany of the Castle of Saint Omer in Thebes, which they held until its destruction in c. 1331/34. Bartholomew II died in 1341, and George succeeded him. In 1343, at the request of Pope Clement VI, he armed a galley conjointly with John I Sanudo (duke of Naxos) and Balzana Gozzadini (regent of the two other thirds of Negroponte) to join the first Smyrniote crusade. According to Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, his disappearance from the sources after the events of 1344/45 could suggest that he may have participated in person and died in the fighting, as did the leaders Henry of Asti, Martino Zaccaria and the Venetian admiral Pietro Zeno. However, the date of 1352 was proposed (without justification) by Karl Hopf in the 19th century. He was followed by his son, Bartholomew III Ghisi, who was still a minor, under the regency of his mother Simona until 1358."

Mast has overseen the seminary in a time of transition as it built a new, smaller, \"technologically smart and environmentally green\" campus on College Avenue and Seminary Place in New Brunswick that was completed in 2014. This move—part of a large-scale redevelopment of the College Avenue area of New Brunswick by New Brunswick Development Corporation (DEVCO), Rutgers University and the seminary—was made in response to the seminary's declining enrollment, financial constraints and to replace an aging campus with a modern, environmentally-friendly campus. Mast was born in 1952 and grew up in Jenison, Michigan. In 1974, Mast earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree majoring in religion from Hope College in Holland, Michigan. Pursuing a vocation in the Christian ministry, he received a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) from the New Brunswick Theological Seminary and was ordained as a clergyman in the Reformed Church in America in 1976. He earned a Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) in 1981 and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Liturgical Studies in 1985 from Drew University in Madison, New Jersey. His doctoral dissertation was titled The Eucharistic Service of the Catholic Apostolic Church and Its Influence on Reformed Liturgical Renewals of the Nineteenth Century (1985) which was later published as a book in 1999. Mast has served congregations in Johannesburg, South Africa, in Newark and Irvington in New Jersey, and Albany, New York. In addition to New Brunswick Theological Seminary, Mast has taught on the faculties of Westminster Choir College, Siena College, St. Bernard's Institute, and as a guest lecturer at the Nkhoma Theological Seminary in Malawi. He served as President of the General Synod of the Reformed Church in America from 1999-2000. He notably said, \"Worship leaders need to strive for a tone that is both relevant and dignified, personal without being private, expressive as well as evocative, and contemporary while embracing the eternal.\" He also said, \"Worship should never remain static. As the congregation changes, so do its needs. The actions of pastor and people working together are critical in creating dynamic worship. After all, the word liturgy means, quite simply, 'the work of the people.’ If our liturgy, and our worship, is to be corporately offered to God, then it is important that worship committees be at the forefront of its corporate creation.\""

  "text" : "Gary Pavkovich (born August 8, 1968), is a South African photographer best known for his controversial series \"Black/White\", depicting the ravages HIV/AIDS has inflicted on the people of Sub Saharan Africa. The controversy arose from the implication that the government of the day in South Africa, and surrounding countries, largely ignored the full scope of the disease and were in denial as to the long-term effects on the population. In 2008 he was SIP photographer of the year. A current resident of Alice Springs, Australia, he is championing Aboriginal art, especially Central desert Aboriginal art with the long-term aim of demonstrating to the world and the art community itself several things about Indigenous Art. Though it is, perhaps, the oldest continuous art form in existence, it can be both ancient art and also modern art. It is contemporary art and wall art; it is one of the most adaptive art forms that can be found today."

Finch, born April 11, 1902 in Dade City, Florida, is considered one of the pioneers in United States aviation history. He began his military career during World War 1, enlisting in the Aviation Section of the Army's Signal Corps in 1918. He remained in the Reserve Corps after the war, and in 1926, became Commander, 27th Pursuit Squadron, 1st Pursuit Group. In 1940, Georgia Governor Ed Rivers commissioned him to form the first flying unit of the Georgia Air National Guard. The unit was mobilized into the U.S. Army in September, 1941, with Major Finch as commander. After World War II, he was a leading critic of efforts to eliminate the air arm of the National Guard during peacetime. General Finch gained the respect and admiration of Air National Guardsmen throughout the nation with his steadfast support and successful efforts to preserve the Air Guard. He became the first Chief of the Air Force Division of the National Guard Bureau in 1948. Under his leadership, the Air National Guard built to combat readiness and was among the first components called into service after the outbreak of the Korean War. As a result of General Finch's vision and perseverance, 45,000 highly trained officers and airmen of 22 wings and 65 squadrons gave the Air Force the strength it needed in the early, critical phases of the Communist drive down the Korean peninsula.General Finch served as the senior Air Force member of the United Nations negotiating team at the peace talks at Panmunjom, Korea, and received the Legion of Merit for outstanding service in 1955; General Finch assumed command of Fourteenth Air Force, Robins AFB, Georgia, becoming the nation's first Air National Guardsman to head a numbered air force. General Finch had a career of \"firsts\" including the US Army's first night landing with a single, five-million-candlepower floodlight in 1927. He also established and endowed the General John P. McConnell Award at the United States Air Force Academy. Considered by many as the father of the strong, independent Air National Guard existing today, General Finch retired in 1957. No man has had greater impact on the Air Force Reserve and National Guard than has General George G. Finch.A graduate of the University of Georgia and a member of the Georgia Bar, General Finch was enshrined in the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame May 18, 1996."

In 1620 her father went to Spain on an embassy, taking his wife and children with him. Sir Walter stayed in Spain for six years, where he converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1645 she married Henry Thimelby from a large recusant family, whose sister Katherine, also a poet, was the wife of Gertrude's brother, Herbert. In 1658, after the deaths of her husband and only child, Getrude became a nun at St. Monica's Convent, Louvain, where her sister-in-law, Winefrid Thimelby, a notable letter-writer, was the Prioress. Sister Gertrude died in 1668. The Aston and Thimelby families and their literary circle exchanged and collected manuscript poems and letters, known today through the volumes edited by their descendants."

In this religious order the severity and austerity of monastic life married with a keen sensitivity to the artistic decoration of the churches and a special interest in a cultural qualification through the study. Figures of great composers and organists will require a bit 'anywhere in the various convents of the Congregation, especially in Bologna, Mantua, Venice and Brescia, where, in the rectory of St. John is the strong influence of traditional instrumental and vocal production environment Brescia Renaissance and Baroque. Among the major players operating in the convent Brescia remember Floriano Channels, Angelo Maria from Peschiera, Leone from Bologna, Dionysius from Fano, Peter Knights, Giovanni Artusi, Pietro Andrea Ziani, Carlo Maffei and not least John Paul Caprioli which we can thank the studies of Oscar Mischiati retrace his monastic pilgrimage: - 1587-1593 Candiana - 1594 Venice - Treviso from 1595 to 1598 - 1599 Piacenza - Bologna from 1600 to 1602 - 1603 Ravenna - 1604-1606 Candiana - 1607 Venice - Abano 1608-1609 - 1610-1621 Modena - Brescia 1622 - Modena 1623 - 1624 -1627 Candiana and abbot in Cento - 1628-1630 Brescia Among the compositions of Caprioli mention the Sonatas artificial, small but varied work that includes songs undoubtedly influenced by the beautiful works of Vecchi, motets for solo voice and as a duo in a popular language concerted, duets and chamber sonatas for an instrument high, one low and basso continuo and Sacrae Cantiones, where the motets for solo voice, with effects of echo organ, the vocal part is made florid and expressive through rapid sprints virtuosic. But some of the best compositions are in the duets of the same volume, where, at times, a painful lack of melodic invention is compensated by the excellent triple counterpoint between the voices and the constant in a declamatory style that anticipates the duets of Monteverdi on the same text.

He then gave vent to his taste for politics and literary criticism, publishing periodicals that led to his imprisonment in the Bastille on three occasions. Fearing further imprisonment, Imbert emigrated to Neuwied, in Rhenish Prussia, where he collaborated in the publication of Francois Metra's secret literary correspondence. He returned to France in 1790, where he ended his days in Paris."

  "text" : "Greg Renker (born 1957), is best known for cofounding Guthy-Renker with partner Bill Guthy. He was born in Phoenix, Arizona in 1957 and had eight siblings. Growing up, Renker's family moved a lot due to his father's work managing country clubs and hotels. Renker worked his way through college at the San Diego State University and married Stacey Renker several years later. Renker credited the Eisenhower hospital for saving his life with an emergency heart bypass surgery and for saving his wife's life from a flu condition. After he recovered, the couple led a donation drive, which led to the creation of The Renker Wellness Center and a 24-room hospital facility called The Greg & Stacey Renker Pavilion. Renker met future business partner Bill Guthy at one of the country clubs managed by his father. The two both enjoyed self-help books and founded Guthy-Renker together to market self-help products in 1988. The company grew into one of the largest direct-response companies on the market and expanded into beauty and fitness products among others. Renker co-founded the National Infomercial Marketing Association (now known as the Electronic Retailing Association) and was awarded the Horatio Alger award, which honors individuals who overcome adversity to achieve success."

The next year he became editor of the Leader, the weekly journal published in connection with the Melbourne Age; and of the latter paper was subsequently sub-editor and, for a short time, editor. Whilst engaged as a journalist, Smith was admitted to the Victorian Bar in September 1861, and in 1865 was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for South Bourke as a Liberal and Protectionist. From July 1868 to September 1869 Smith was Attorney-General in the second James McCulloch Ministry, but at the General Election in January 1871 he did not seek re-election for South Bourke.On 17 May 1870 a disgruntled Irish-born previous employee at The Age, Gerald Supple, shot Smith in La Trobe Street, inflicting a wound to Smith's elbow and killing a bystander. In 1874, Smith was again returned unopposed, and sat till 1877, when the constituency was divided, and Smith was returned for the Boroondara portion. Smith died on 9 December 1877."

It represents him in a sitting posture, his stalwart body bared to the waist, his fine head and intelligent face in profile, his left arm bent, resting upon his hip, and his naked back exposed to full view.  Upon that back, horrible to contemplate! is a testimony against slavery more eloquent than any words.  Scarred, gouged, gathered in great ridges, knotted, furrowed, the poor tortured flesh stands out a hideous record of the slave-driver's lash.  Months have elapsed since the martyrdom was undergone, and the wounds have healed, but as long as the flesh lasts will this fearful impress remain.  It is a touching picture, an appeal so mute and powerful that none but hardened natures can look upon it unmoved.  However much men may depict false images, the sun will not lie.  From such evidence as this there is no escape, and to see is to believe.  Many, therefore, desired a copy of the photograph, and from the original numerous copies have been taken.", "We received from Baton Rouge the photographic likeness of a slave's naked back, lacerated by the whip [...]  We look on the picture with amazement that cannot find words for utterance.  Amazement at the cruelty which could perpetrate such an outrage as this; at the brutal folly, the stupid ignorance, that could permit such a piece of infatuation; at the absence not only of humane feeling, but of economical prudence of common sense, of ordinary intelligence, displayed in such frantic thoughtlessness.  Among what sort of people are such things possible? [...] This card-photograph should be multiplied by the hundred thousand, and scattered over the states.  It tells the story in a way that even Mrs. Stowe cannot approach; because it tells the story to the eye.  If seeing is believing — and it is in the immense majority of cases — seeing this card would be equivalent to believing things of the slave states which Northern men and women would move heaven and earth to abolish!", "I enclose a picture taken by an artist here, from life, of a Negro's back, exhibiting the scars from an old whipping.  Few sensation writers ever depicted worse punishments than this man must have received, though nothing in his appearance indicates any unusual viciousness — but on the contrary, he seems INTELLIGENT and WELL-BEHAVED.

  "text" : "Gordon, or \"Whipped Peter\", was an enslaved African American who escaped from a Louisiana plantation in March 1863, gaining freedom when he reached the Union camp near Baton Rouge. He became known as the subject of photographs documenting the extensive scarring of his back from whippings received in slavery. Abolitionists distributed these carte de visite photographs of Gordon throughout the United States and internationally to show the abuses of slavery. In July 1863 these images appeared in an article about Gordon published in Harper's Weekly, the most widely read journal during the Civil War. The pictures of Gordon's scourged back provided Northerners with visual evidence of brutal treatment of slaves and inspired many free blacks to enlist in the Union Army. Gordon joined the United States Colored Troops soon after their founding, and served as a soldier in the war."

  "text" : "Sir Godfrey de Foljambe (1317–1376) was a prominent landowner and politician in fourteenth-century England who went on to have a successful career as an Irish judge, including a period as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. In later life he was an associate of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. His tomb can still be seen at All Saints Church, Bakewell. He was born in Derbyshire in 1317, the fourth son of Sir Thomas de Foljambe. The Foljambe family were Lords of the Manor of Tideswell and also held lands at Darley Dale. Godfrey, who succeeded to the family estates after the death of his three elder brothers, also acquired the manor of Bakewell, where he founded a chantry. He sat in the House of Commons as knight of the shire for Derbyshire in several of the Parliaments of King Edward III. In 1344 he went to Ireland as a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland), and was quickly transferred to the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). He served as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland from 1351 to 1354. On his return to England he sat regularly on commissions for the peace in Derbyshire and Lancashire. He enjoyed the trust and confidence of John of Gaunt, for whom he acted in numerous administrative capacities, including steward for the Duchy of Lancaster. For a number of years he had a lease on a substantial part of Newcastle under Lyme for which he paid £127 p.a. to John of Gaunt. He died in 1376. He married (possibly his second marriage, though little is known of the first), Avena (died 1382), daughter of Sir Thomas Ireland of Hartshorne, by whom he had several sons, including Geoffrey Foljambe the younger (died 1375), and Thomas Foljambe (died 1433), who was a Baron of the Exchequer and chief steward of the duchy of Lancaster. Among his descendants were Sir Francis Foljambe (died 1640), first and last of the Foljambe baronets, and the Earls of LIverpool, second creation. The mural alabaster monument to Godfrey and Avena is said to be very rare with only two surviving to the present day. The Foljambe mural shows Foljambe and his wife as if they are looking out of a window and this can still be seen on the south wall of All Saints Church in Bakewell. Below the mural is an explanatory inscription that dates from 1803 and was \"added by Mr Blore\"."

  "text" : "Gunda Beeg was one of the founding members of the women's dress reform movement in late 19th early 20th century Germany. Beeg came from a family of action takers. Her grandfather was the founder of the Germanic Museum in Nuremberg, Baron Aufsess. Her father was the director of the Kunstgewerbe, Nuremberg Museum of Industrial Arts, and her mother was the founder of the School for Women's Work in Nuremberg. It is in said school that Beeg attained all her training. When her time came, Beeg helped found the first German organization for the improvement of women's dress. She and other dress reformers were interested in not only the aesthetic and practical evolution of clothing but also in thinking of women's emancipation through the clothing they wore. The German telephone and postal service employed over 25,000 women in their organization. These women were expected to wear a blouse as part of their mandatory uniform, which, due to its design, required them to wear corsets underneath. A union was formed in 1912, Union of Women Telephone and Telegraph Employees, that partnered with the Berlin office of the dress reform organization in order to help get an improved uniform introduced. The proposed reformed blouse was both designed and executed by Beeg. Once the design was complete, one of the larger telephone exchanges tried it out for a year by making it an “optional alternative to the old-fashioned ‘squeezer.' The young women preferred it so overwhelmingly that it was officially adopted as a civil service uniform at the end of the trial year.”"

  "text" : "George Barasch (December 10, 1910 – August 11, 2013) was a US union labor leader who led both the Allied Trades Council and Teamsters Local 815 (New York), representing a combined total of 11,000 members. He was the first labor leader to create a union anti-crime department, and he was instrumental in eliminating racketeering and organized crime from much of local union life in New Jersey and New York City in the early 1950s. His disputes with the United States government in the mid-1960s over control of union benefit funds ultimately led to proposed legislation that prompted and evolved into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In 1964, after spending over two decades fighting for the rights of workers to organize and thrive, Barasch created the Allied Educational Foundation (AEF)  as an independent organization that would continue to advance the education and rights of working Americans outside the labor arena. The semi-annual AEF conferences served as a forum for high-ranking political figures, academics, legal scholars, and civil rights activists including Senator William Proxmire, Martin Luther King, Jr., U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, President Gerald Ford, Vice President Walter F. Mondale, labor columnist Victor Riesel, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Harrison E. Salisbury, and economist Leo Cherne. Barasch remained Chairman of the Allied Educational Foundation for 49 years until his death, at 102."

  "text" : "George Henry Clinton was a chemist, lawyer, and Democratic politician from St. Joseph in Tensas Parish in the northeastern Mississippi River delta of the U.S. state of Louisiana. Clinton was born in the late 1860s in Natchez in western Mississippi. His father was a native of East Feliciana Parish, one of the Florida Parishes of southeastern Louisiana. The senior Clinton served in the Confederate Army and became the district attorney for the Louisiana 6th Judicial District, based about St. Joseph, Tallulah in Madison Parish, and Lake Providence in East Carroll Parish. Clinton's mother was part of the Briscoe family of Claiborne County, Mississippi. Clinton attended school in New Orleans and at the Chamberlain-Hunt Academy in Port Gibson, Mississippi, before he graduated in 1889 from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Clinton worked as a sugar chemist in Louisiana, Cuba, and Mexico. In 1898, he began his legal practice in St. Joseph. Clinton served on the LSU Board of Supervisors. He was a state representative from 1908 to 1912, having served alongside the cotton planter Samuel W. Martien of Waterproof in southern Tensas Parish. He was twice a state senator, from 1912 to 1916 and again from 1920 to 1924. Clinton also served on the Louisiana Board of Appraisers and was a director of the East Louisiana State Hospital. He was a member and president of the Tensas Parish School Board, based in St. Joseph, and a delegate to the 1913 and 1921 state constitutional conventions. Nothing is known of Clinton after he left the state Senate in 1924. He is not buried in Legion Memorial Cemetery in Newellton nor is he listed at Natchez City Cemetery, the resting place of most whites in St. Joseph until the middle to late 1940s."

  "text" : "Grace Akallo (born 1981) is a Ugandan woman who, at the age of 15, while attending a Catholic school, was abducted by Joseph Kony to be used as a child soldier in the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). As part of her initiation into the army, she was forced to kill another girl, a very common practice among armies that employ child soldiers. She remained in the LRA for seven months, during which Akallo became a skilled AK-47 user. She was raped and became a sexual slave. She was eventually rehabilitated and became a mother. The 2007 book Girl Soldier: A Story of Hope for Northern Uganda's Children is a biography of Akallo. She is interviewed in the 2011 documentary film Not My Life on the subject of human trafficking, saying that \"this kind of evil must be stopped.\" After escaping, Grace returned to St. Mary's school to finish her high school education. She began her college education at the Uganda Christian University. After giving a speech for Amnesty International in New York, she received a scholarship to finish her undergraduate degree at a college in Massachusetts. Grace majored in communications with a desire to continue studying International relations and conflict resolution. Grace went on to receive her master's degree from Clark University. She would use her information gained in her studies and experiences to try to keep what happened to her from happening to other innocent children. Grace used the experiences she had from being a child soldier to help counsel children who had escaped like her. Grace gave many speeches at educational establishments such as Rutgers University in New Jersey, and Roosevelt University in Chicago. She also shared her story on shows including The Oprah Winfrey Show. Grace worked lobbying United States congressmen about the issue of child slavery in Uganda. Grace began her career as an advocate for peace and justice with jobs at Rachelle Rehabilitation Center and World Vision USA. Grace later worked as a Public Relations and Advocacy Intern in America, writing press releases and documents for media use. She reported on conferences including The Interfaith Summit on Africa, and drafted amendments for the Senate bill on children affected by war. In America she has started a non-profit organisation (UAWCR) that aims to end the prosecution of child soldiers. Grace Akallo has also catalysed action in Washington D.C. to help end the violence in Uganda; in addition she has appeared in public to raise awareness amongst the common people in addition to the politicians. She appears in the documentary film Grace, Milly, Lucy... Child Soldiers."

In June 1940, the head-office had been transferred to Cordite Avenue at Maribyrnong. In the following year Ravenhall was given responsibility for Defence Department transport operations across the country under a separate Transport Branch located at 83 William Street, Melbourne. Ravenhall was appointed president of the Association of Charge Engineers in 1946. Ravenhall was also closely involved in the North Melbourne Football Club for much of his adult life, serving as president in 1922. and being made a life member in 1950.

  "text" : "George Michanowsky (1920–1993) was an American archaeologist who discovered some markings on Bolivian rocks in 1956. In 1977 he published a book called The Once and Future Star in which he explained his theory of supernova explosion on a constellation named Vela which happened 7,000 years ago. In the same work he also mentions that Atlantis is called NI-DUK-KI in Sumerian texts and is used to be Isle of the Blest before the flood. Later on, as he explained, after the flood, it was named Dilmun. His theory isn't well received by other scientists in the same field; For example David Hatcher Childress argues that it is impossible for Atlantis to be Dilmun since its one of the Bahrain islands. Michanowsky also suggested that global warming played an effect in Atlantis disappearance."

  "text" : "Gerard Irwin Nierenberg (27 July 1923 - 19 September 2012) was an American lawyer, author, and expert in negotiation and communication strategy. Forbes named Nierenberg “The Father of Negotiation Training” for his exploration of negotiation strategies and tactics as well as his decades of work disseminating the philosophy that “in a successful negotiation, everybody wins.” He published 22 books on the subject, and in 1966 he founded The Negotiation Institute where he began a legacy of government, corporate, and non-profit organizational reform based on his ideas of how negotiation impacts the lives of everyone. The three core tenets of Nierenberg’s philosophy are (1) to be patient; (2) to strive to meet the needs of the opposition party in order to build sustainable relationships from which all parties feel that they have 'won'; and (3) to limit frustrations in all negotiations by embracing the fact that logic does not always lead to negotiated success. Nierenberg left a wife, Juliet, with whom he had three sons: Roy, Roger, and George."

He became a farmer in the area near the Olifants River. In 1780, he was found guilty of killing a Nama and wounding two others. To escape punishment by the authorities, he and his wife moved north of the Orange River. In 1785, Guilliam and his wife Elsab Visagie settled in an area which he named Modderfontein (mud fountain), becoming the first Europeans to establish a permanent settlement in Namibia. In 1791 he was living at Swartmodder (modern Keetmanshoop), where he farmed and traded firearms to the Namas for cattle. In 1793, he withdrew from his farm after a clash with Afrikaner Oorlams commandos, who were apparently acting on orders from the VOC."

Nowadays he is largely forgotten but to his contemporaries and those that followed immediately afterwards, he was one of the key engineers of the early railway age being listed alongside Brunel, Stephenson, Locke and Cubitt in George Drysdale Dempsey's book, the Practical Railway Engineer.

  "text" : "Gustav of Saxe-Lauenburg (31 August 1570 (?) – 11 November 1597) was the eldest son of Magnus II, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg and Sophia of Sweden, the daughter of King Gustav I of Sweden. Gustav's father Magnus left Sweden in 1578 when he was expelled by King John III for beating his wife. John forced him to leave Gustav in the care of his mother Sofia. Gustav was raised at Ekolsund by his mother. His upbringing was seen as poor due to his mother's fickle nature and over-indulgence of her son. Duke Charles (later King Charles IX) took him in, believing he would be better off growing up at his court. In 1590, Gustav was expelled from King John's court because of excessive behavior in the taverns of Stockholm, which led to his mother's intervening on his behalf with a plea to the queen, Gunilla Bielke. In 1591, Gustav traveled to the continent and went as far as Italy, returning to Sweden in January 1594. From 28 June he had received an income from the fiefdoms of hundreds of Håbo, Ärlinghundra and Lagunda. In 1595 he came into conflict with his mother over sharing the proceeds from his fiefdoms. Sofia's income was in danger, but the issue was solved when King Charles forced him to return the fiefdoms, which were given to his mother. Gustav's income was later bolstered by getting the rights to the church tithes. In 1597 he also received the rights of Haguna hundred and the parishes of Lagunda and Håbo that were not under Sofia's control. In the conflict between Sigismund III Vasa and Charles IX, Gustav sided with the latter and was put in charge of Kalmar Castle on 8 June 1597. On 11 August the same year he accidentally shot himself through the knee at a muster outside of Stockholm and died on 11 November from his injuries. He was buried together with his maternal aunt, Elisabet Vasa, 21 January 1598 in Uppsala Cathedral. A cenotaph over them was added as late as 1829."

  "text" : "Sir George Stephen Q.C., (1794 – 20 June 1879) was a solicitor, author and anti-slavery proponent. Stephen was the fourth and youngest son of James Stephen, C.B., by his marriage with Ann, only child of Henry Stent, of Stoke Newington, a village then just north of London. He was the brother of the Right Hon. Sir James Stephen, for many years Under-Secretary of State in the Colonial Office, whose policy he for a long period initiated and controlled. Born in 1794 at Saint Kitts, George Stephen was originally intended for the medical profession; but after spending three years in the study of anatomy, and going through a two-years' course at Magdalene College, Cambridge, which he left without graduating, after doing brilliant work, he entered the office of Messrs. Kaye & Freshfield, solicitors to the Bank of England. Having served his articles, he commenced practice on his own account, and was engaged by the Government to obtain evidence against Queen Caroline, of whose guilt he was fully assured. It was, however, in connection with the movement for the abolition of slavery in the British colonies that he mainly distinguished himself. His father (James Stephen) had married, as his second wife, the sister of William Wilberforce, and was allied with that great man, Zachary Macaulay, Thomas Clarkson, and others in the abolition of the slave trade, achieved in 1807. In the legitimate development of that noble work, which ended in the suppression of slavery, as well as of the slave trade, throughout the British dominions. Sir George Stephen bore a leading part, and it was his decision (extorted from him by the necessities of the case) in favour of admitting the principle of compensation that brought the agitation to a much earlier successful issue than could otherwise have been ensured. Sir George (who was knighted in 1837, being the first so honoured after Queen Victoria's accession) subsequently ceased to practise as a solicitor, with a view to being called to the Bar. This was accomplished, in 1849, under the auspices of Gray's Inn; and Sir George then removed to Liverpool, where he practised at the local Bar for some years. Business falling off, Stephen determined to follow his two sons to Australia, and took up his residence in Melbourne in 1855. Though this step was afterwards a matter of regret with him, he did fairly well at the Victorian Bar, principally in insolvency cases, and became a Q.C. in 1871. In 1866 he acted as Commissioner of Insolvent Estates at Geelong. Sir George (who was a cousin of Sir Alfred Stephen) married, in 1821, Henrietta, eldest daughter of the Rev. William Ravenscroft, Prebendary of Down Cathedral, Ireland, who died in 1871. He died in Caulfield, Victoria on 20 June 1879.In addition to an autobiography written for his children, Sir George published, in 1839, anonymously, \"Adventures of an Attorney in Search of a Practice\"; and was also the author of \"The Jesuit at Cambridge,\" published the same year; and of \"Adventures of a Gentleman in Search of a Horse,\" a brochure intended to illustrate in an amusing form the operation of the warranty law, which ran through half a dozen editions. Sir George also wrote several orthodox law books and a \"Life of Christ.\" Mr. Justice FitzJames Stephen and Leslie Stephen were nephews of Sir George Stephen, being the sons of his brother, the late Right Hon. Sir James Stephen. George Stephen's son was James Wilberforce Stephen, later Attorney-General of Victoria and Supreme Court judge. George Stephen was a man of very considerable abilities and force of character. He was upright and outspoken; but a hot temper and an unfortunate talent for seeing the worst side of his profession and his fellow-creatures involved him in many disputes, and injured his career."

He completed two large frescoes (now lost) for the church of San Nazzaro e Celso, Milan. He also painted an altarpiece of the Death of Santa Monica for the church of Sant'Agostino in Reggio Emilia. He painted the Portrait of Giovanni Pagani, found in the painting gallery of the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan. Ugolini also painted portraits from photographs of the Taikun (Shogun) of Japan and the Shogun's wife. For the Shogun, he completed his portraits of the principal monarchs of Europe. In Milan he completed an oil portrait of King Umberto I and Vittorio Emanuele II. In Rome he completed two marble portraits of queen Margherita. He sculpted busts of the painter Hayez, Father Secchi, Alessandro Manzoni, and Marco Minghetti. Other works by Ugolini are: Il messaggero inconscio and II fido messaggero, exhibited at Rome and Turin. He was made a knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy."

  "text" : "Giovanni Gioviale (November 1885 – June 11, 1949) was an Italian composer and musician. He is considered one of the greatest mandolin virtuosos of all time. He also played guitar and banjo, and at the concert level with violin. He is special among the Italian mandolin masters, as one of the only ones to be recorded. He has also been credited for making famous the duo style of mandolin playing, in which one instrument sounds like several. Born Catania, Gioviale took up the mandolin when he was ten-years old. He was impressed by the music he heard at a barbershop. Craft halls were one of the types of place one could hear music in Catania then. He learned the mandolin first, then added banjo, guitar and violin, which he learned in school. He was an internationally travelling performer, performing in Spain, Africa, England, Austria and the United States. While in the United States, from 1926 to 1929, he recorded more than 50 recordings. After three years in the U.S., he missed his home and moved back to Italy. He was planning to return when he died in 1949. He continued to perform in Italy, playing in Turin, Milan, Rome, Genoa, and Palmero. In addition to his own works, he performed works by Francesco Paolo Frontini, Cali, Vincenzo Bellini, Mozart, Edvard Grieg, Amilcare Ponchielli, Giuseppe Verdi, Felix Mendelssohn, and Pietro Mascagni."

  "text" : "George Landen Dann (1 January 1904 – 6 June 1977) was an Australian playwright, writer, and draftsman. He is best known for a number of award-winning and critically acclaimed plays such as In Beauty It Is Finished, Fountains Beyond, Caroline Chisholm and The Orange Grove. Dann wrote dozens of published and unpublished plays over the course of his lifetime. Originally writing plays for the amateur dramatic society at Sandgate, Queensland, Dann was a particularly shy and reclusive person, and even though he wrote part-time, his more popular plays were widely performed by amateur theatre companies around Australia. George Landen Dann's writing has been appreciated for its social realism, with a number of his plays delving into issues involving Indigenous Australians and their central characters reflecting individuals that Dann had met during his time in outback Australia. The George Landen Dann Award was established in 1992. It was awarded to promising young Australian playwrights until 2007."

Eight years after competing in her first Olympics, Irusta qualified for her third Bolivian team, as a 28-year-old, in the 20 km race walk at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens by attaining a B-standard entry time of 1:32:06 from La Coruña Grand Prix. She surpassed Ukraine's Vira Zozulya and held off United States' Teresa Vaill by a ten-second edge on the final lap to cross the finish line with a forty-first place time in 1:38:36. Building her own milestone as a three-time Olympian, Irusta was also appointed by the National Olympic Committee (Spanish: Comité Olímpico Boliviano) to carry the Bolivian flag in the opening ceremony. At the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Irusta almost claimed a silver medal in a tight finish against El Salvador's Cristina López in the same program, but was disqualified by the officials for lifting a third time at the final lap."

  "text" : "Geraldine Claudette Darden (born July 22, 1936) is an American mathematician. She was the fourteenth African American woman to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics. She was born in Nansemond County, Virginia. Darden earned her degrees in mathematics from Hampton Institute (B.S., 1957) an historically black institute; an M.S. (1960) University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, and her M.S. (1965) and a Ph.D. (1967) from Syracuse University. Her dissertation was completed under the auspices of James Reid, Ph.D., entitled, \"On the Direct Sums of Cyclic Groups\". Initially Darden taught at S.H. Clarke Junior High School in Portsmouth, Virginia, immediately after receiving her undergraduate degree in 1957. In the summer of 1958, Darden saw an opportunity for aspiring mathematicians created by the launch of Russian satellite Sputnik and ensuing US interest in mathematics and science a year earlier, and she applied for and received a National Science Foundation grant to attend the Summer Institute in Mathematics held at North Carolina Central University. Here she met Marjorie Lee Browne, the mathematician who directed the Institute, who would encourage Darden to go on to graduate school at Syracuse. In addition to teaching, Darden also co-wrote selected papers on pre-calculus, with textbook author Tom Apostol, Gulbank D. Chakerian, and John D. Neff.

He was then appointed mayor on 8 June, after his party, the Republican Party of Armenia, won the election. On 8 December 2010. he resigned as mayor, having assaulted an official, following an incident at a Plácido Domingo concert. The official – Aram Kandayan, an employee at the President's protocol department – had asked the mayor's wife to give up her seat. She had been sitting next to the President Serzh Sargsyan in a seat normally reserved for the Prime Minister or the Catholicos of All Armenians. Although not present at the concert, Beglaryan arranged to meet Kandayan after the event and assaulted the latter before he could get out of his car. On June 16, 2012, he was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications. Beglaryan is an economist by training, having studied at the Yerevan State University, School of Physics and Mathematics (1978-1981) and the Yerevan Institute of National Economy (1981-1985). In 2004, he defended his thesis “The main social problems of community management”. He is married with two children."

He has held two European Championship titles (2001 and 2005) and a silver medal in the same division at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York, New York, United States, and later represented his nation Moldova at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Throughout his sporting career, Tulbea has been training under his personal coach and mentor Nicolae Oreol for the Olympic Sports Club (Moldovan: Olimpiu de club sportiv) in Chisinau before he transferred his residency to Monaco and played for the wrestling team in 2010. Tulbea qualified for Moldova in the men's 55 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens by placing second behind Uzbekistan's Dilshod Mansurov from the World Wrestling Championships in New York, New York, United States. He was placed by a random draw into a three-man preliminary pool against Cuba's René Montero and United States' Stephen Abas. At the end of the pool, Tulbea lost two straight matches each to Montero (0–5) and Abas (1–6) with a single classification and technical point, finishing only in third place and twenty-first overall in the final standings. At the 2005 European Wrestling Championships in Varna, Bulgaria, Tulbea outclassed the host nation's strong contender Radoslav Velikov to capture the flyweight title, adding it to his gold medal from the same tournament in 2001. Moldova's prime minister Vasile Tarlev also congratulated him for his tremendous triumph at the European Championships, mentioning that \"his success has finally made the country's image to the world and his performance has become a model for the young generation\". In 2008, Tulbea sought his bid to compete for his second Olympics in Beijing, but finished farther from the mandatory slots in two successive Olympic Qualification Tournaments. Shortly after the bid, Tulbea announced his early retirement from the sporting career, citing personal reasons and problems with injuries that did not allow him to train and perform adequately. Tulbea eventually worked as an assistant coach for the Moldovan wrestling team, until he made a final decision to gain a dual residency status upon his immediate transfer to Monaco in 2009. Coming out of retirement, Tulbea officially became part of the Monegasque wrestling team in 2010, and has been currently training under his new coach Grigori Buliga for Automobile Club de Monaco. He made his debut for Monaco at the World Championships, but was surprisingly beaten in the opening match by Belarus' Rizvan Gadzhiev. The following year, at the 2011 European Wrestling Championships in Dortmund, Germany, Tulbea pulled off a courageous fight for his new squad with a top finish in the men's flyweight division, but lost the bronze medal match to another Belarusian Uladzislau Andreyeu."

He was initially unhappy with his job and would often skip working to play golf, demoted to assistant editor due to this. Ruggiero came to prominence after editing the 1939 film Ninotchka. As nobody else would edit the film due to Ernst Lubitsch's reputation, the job was assigned to Ruggiero. He received his first credit on the film, and continued as an editor for the rest of his career. Ruggiero earned an Academy Award for Best Film Editing in 1956 for his work on Around the World in 80 Days, which he shared with Paul Weatherwax. He was also nominated for an Academy Award in 1955 for his editing on Oklahoma!, which he shared with George Boemler."

  "text" : "(James) Gordon McKenzie (28 December 1917 – 3 December 1998) was a British journalist and editor who worked for much of his career at the Daily Mail rising to be the paper's executive editor. Born in Cammachmore, Aberdeenshire, he started his career as a trainee reporter at the Aberdeen Bon Accord in 1935, later joining the Aberdeen Press and Journal before the outbreak of World War 2. He joined the Gordon Highlanders and was commissioned as an officer in 1941 into the Durham Light Infantry. He served in North Africa, Palestine and Italy where he was mentioned in dispatches and wounded in combat during the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944. He finished his war service editing an English language paper in newly liberated Vienna.Returning to civilian life as the Press and Journal's London editor in 1947 he gained an exclusive interview with Queen Mary, the then Queen Mother, which brought him to the attention of Fleet Street.After working for Denis Hamilton, editorial director of Kemsley Newspapers and alongside the group's Foreign Manager Ian Fleming he was given his first editorship at the Sunday Chronicle in 1950: at the age of 33 McKenzie was Fleet Street's youngest editor. He then edited the Sunday Graphic from 1953-58 where his ideas and production flair attracted the attention of the then Lord Rothermere Esmond Harmsworth. He took up a new editorship at the Sunday Dispatch before moving to the Daily Mail in 1958 as assistant editor. He directed an internationally envied, intellectually diverse team of writers. Among them were Bernard Levin, Vincent Mulchrone, Shirley Conran, Godfrey Winn, Anne Scott-James, Quentin Crew, Barry Norman and Lynda Lee-Potter. As executive editor in the 1970s and early 1980s, he headed the features department and was a key figure in the Femail marketing policy of attracting women readers without alienating its male readership. He retired in 1983 as executive editor but continued in an advisory capacity at You magazine, as literary editor for the Mail as well as working on book serialisations almost until the end of his life. McKenzie married actress Vicki Campbell in 1947 and the journalist Rod McKenzie is their son."

  "text" : "Gustave Dutailly (2 August 1846, in Meuvy (Haute-Marne) – 4 February 1906) was a French botanist, politician and art collector. He studied plant physiology in Paris, and in the meantime made contributions to the Dictionnaire de botanique. In 1870 he became a member of the Société linnéenne de Paris, and in 1875 a member of the Société botanique de France. In 1880 he was appointed a professor of botany to the faculty of sciences at Lyon. In Lyon, he also served as director of the Parc de la Tête d'Or. From 1882, he was a member of the Société botanique de Lyon. In 1881 he resigned his professorship in order to pursue scientific activities that included work associated with the Association française pour l’avancement des sciences (French Association for the Advancement of Sciences). During the same year, he became a deputy (political title) of the arrondissement of Chaumont, and in 1885 was named deputy of the department of Haute-Marne. A passionate collector of poster art, during his lifetime he amassed a collection of 5000 posters composed by artists that included Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Pierre Bonnard, Leonetto Cappiello, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Léon Willette and Jules-Alexandre Grün. At the time of his death, his art collection as well as a library of 3500 volumes were bequeathed to the city of Chaumont. The genus Dutaillyea (family Rutaceae) was named in his honor by Henri Ernest Baillon."

  "text" : "George W. F. McMechen (1871–1961) was a prominent African-American lawyer in Baltimore. Along with his brother-in-law William Ashbie Hawkins he was a leading advocate for African-American civil rights. McMehen was born in Wheeling, West Virginia on October 29, 1871 to George and Mildred McMechen. He had two sisters, Ethel and Marnie. He first began his law practice in Evansville, Indiana. In 1891, McMechen enrolled in the first class of what is now Morgan State University where he received his bachelor's degree. In 1895, he enrolled in and received a law degree from Yale Law School. He married Anna Lee Mason of Sparta, Illinois in 1900 and they had four daughters: Mildred, Edythe, Katherine, and Georgeanna. In 1904 he moved to Baltimore and was admitted to the Maryland bar, where he ran a practice with William Ashbie Hawkins until Hawkins in 1941.The McMechen's family move in 1909 to a majority white neighborhood in northwest Baltimore prompted the passing of a law forbidding African-Americans from moving to blocks that were more than 50% white, and vice versa. The city government pioneered statutes that legally sanctioned segregation in housing. In 1915, McMechen ran the Baltimore City Council seat for the 14th district, however, he lost. From 1921 to 1939, he was on the governing board of Morgan State University. He was also the first African-American on the board of school commissioners of Baltimore, serving from 1944 to 1950. McMechen also served as a board member of the Morgan Corporation upon the state takeover of the college in 1939. Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro III appointed him to the Advisory Committee to the Baltimore Charter Revision Committee. McMechen retired in 1955 and died on February 22, 1961. The business and economics building at Morgan State University is named for him. There is also a combined high school/middle school in Baltimore named for him."

  "text" : "Gavin Dalzell, 2nd Earl of Carnwath (1627−1674), styled by the courtesy title Lord Dalzell from 1639, was a Scottish nobleman and Royalist supporter during the English Civil War. He was the son of Robert Dalzell, 1st Earl of Carnwath and Christian Douglas. He married, firstly, Margaret Carnegie, daughter of David Carnegie, Lord Carnegie and Lady Margaret Hamilton, circa 21 July 1637, with whom he had seven children. He married secondly by contract, Lady Mary Erskine, daughter of Alexander Erskine, Earl of Kellie and Lady Anne Seton, on 14 December 1663. He was styled in Scotland as Earl of Carnwath between 25 February 1645 and 21 June 1654, after the title was declared to have descended by an Act of the Scottish Parliament, due to his father having been accused by the Convention of the Scottish Estate of betraying them to the King. He fought in the Battle of Worcester on the Royalist side, and was taken prisoner, being held for many years. He died in June 1674, and his titles were inherited by his eldest son, James Dalzell."

He is recognized as the leading scholar, translator and editor of the work of Max Weber in the English-speaking world; together with Claus Wittich, he translated and edited the first complete version of Weber's classic Economy and Society in English. As of 2013, he is professor emeritus at Columbia University. Later, his research interest extended to the biographical aspects of the sociological classics, in particular the genealogy of Weber's family. Roth studied at Goethe University Frankfurt under Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer and Friedrich Pollock and worked at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt. He arrived in the United States in 1953 and completed his graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1960, he obtained a PhD under Reinhard Bendix with a dissertation on the development of social democracy in Imperial Germany (1871–1918). Roth became a U.S. citizen in 1963. He taught at the University of Washington from 1970 until 1988 and then at Columbia University until his retirement in 1997. He is married to Columbia historian Caroline Bynum."

  "text" : "Giovanni Antonio Rigatti (c. 1613 – 24 October 1648) was an Italian composer and choirmaster of the early Baroque period. Rigatti received his musical training as a choirboy at St. Mark's Basilica in 1621, as well as in one of the conservatories of Venice. He also received training to become a priest. From September 1635 to March 1637 he was kapellmeister in the Udine Cathedral. In 1639, he worked at the Conservatory of the Ospedale dei Mendicanti in Venice. Rigatti taught also at the Ospedale dei Incurabili without the approval of his superiors, until a Commission dismissed him. Rigatti published nine volumes of spiritual music (five soloist motets and four Psalms). He also published two books of secular music. He wrote a mass and Psalms in 1640 dedicated to Emperor Ferdinand III."

  "text" : "George Julius Brockman (2 January 1850 – 29 August 1912) was a prominent explorer and pastoralist in the Gascoyne and Kimberley regions of Western Australia. Born in 1850 at Guildford, George was the seventh son of Robert Brockman and brother of Charles Samuel Brockman. Brockman Snr was a settler in the Lake Bamban district near Gingin. The family moved to Mimigarra, near Moore River while Brockman was still a boy then later to a property on the Greenough River. Brockman left home at 16 years of age and rode south to Busselton and eventually took a job on Henty station near Bunbury. The May River and Meda River were named in 1881 by Brockman during an expedition in the Kimberley area looking for grazing land north of the Fitzroy River. He named the Meda is named after HMS Meda, an Admiralty surveying vessel that charted the coastline in the area including the river mouth in 1880. after the granddaughter of John Septimus Roe, Mary Matilda (May) Thomson. Brockman applied for a 250,000 acres (101,171 ha) leasehold along the Meda which the government refused instead offering a lease for 100,000 acres (40,469 ha) for 12 years rent free. He stocked the property with 1,100 ewes which suffered through drought followed by floods. Brockman acquired the 800,000 acres (323,749 ha) Minilya Station in 1884 for £15,000, from his brother. The property was struck by drought in 1890, then a lean season n 1891. By 1893 good rains meant good feed and plentiful water with Brockman selling plenty of stock. Drought came again in 1895 and 1896 reducing his flock of sheet from 12,500 and his cattle from 3,000 to 10. and remained there until 1902, then selling the property to Mr. D. N. McLeod. He then travelled and bought a property in Guildford. Brockman died on 29 August 1912 in Geraldton."

  "text" : "Greg Bryant is a computer scientist and community organizer, best known as the founder of Workspot in downtown Palo Alto during the dotcom boom, and editor of RAIN Magazine since 1989. He also acted as a liaison between the computer industry and Christopher Alexander on many projects. In computing, he was an early promoter of virtual machines, which led to work promoting UNIX and software tools at Intel headquarters during the 80386 project, and the creation of several production domain-specific languages. He built languages and authoring tools for the first consumer in-car navigation systems, and the first mobile traffic app, and built the first fullscreen mobile apps for Google, and for eBay. He introduced the idea of 'unfolding programming sequences', and the category of 'operational grammars' with the programming language 'grogix'. He writes about foundation problems in computing philosophy, and presents on the application of software to urban issues. His community organizing closely follows his research and writing for RAIN Magazine. He co-founded two special-purpose community centers, which were also local business incubators: the Center for Appropriate Transport and the Tango Center in Eugene, Oregon. Defending the Tango Center led to a ballot measure that temporarily defunded Urban Renewal in downtown Eugene, Measure 20-134 in November 2007, which may be the central factor in its rejuvenation."

The New York Philharmonic under Dmitri Mitropoulos gave his career a promising start as a prize-winning young composer at Carnegie Hall in 1957. Aaron Copland said he was \"his most gifted student\". He studied with famous teachers and won more awards and stipends in academia, but drifted into virtual anonymity until the mid-1990s. He began begging on the streets of Paris around 1980. A 1994 Norddeutscher Rundfunk/Arte feature-length television documentary \"Der Bettler von Paris\" exposed his life and work to German audiences, who were the first to hear his symphony and other works were premiered and recorded at the beginning of the 21st century."

She studied at the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts under H. P. Gill, Archibald Collins and Hans Heysen. She was a council member of the South Australian Society of Arts for over 30 years, and was also well known as a teacher. She was noted for watercolours of flowers and landscapes, to which she invested a fairyland-like glamour and remained immune to trends and changing fashions. In 1928 following an extensive sketching tour of Europe she held a solo exhibition in Adelaide which achieved a near record sale (over £1000) for an Australian woman. She died in Adelaide on 26 August 1960 after a long illness. She is represented in the State galleries of South Australia and Victoria, and the National Gallery, Canberra."

  "text" : "Guglielmo Botti (December 9, 1829 – after 1906) was an Italian dresser and restorer. He was born in Pisa. He trained under Tommaso Gazzarrini in Pisa, and Giuseppe Bezzuoli in Florence. He trained as an artist of stained glass, closely studying Italian stained glass from the 14th and early 15th century to discover their techniques. He did so well that he was, erroneously, credited for rediscovering \"the ancient manner\" of painting on glass. He was sponsored by Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, developing new stained-glass techniques. He avoided a composition of many separate pieces of colored glass by keeping the lead lines to a minimum and painting directly on the larger panes of glass with many colors of enamel pigments. Shortly afterwards he was asked (together with Tito Gordini) by patrons in Pisa to create stained-glass windows for the Pisa Baptistry. He also put his technique to practical use in churches of Pisa (San Paolo, 1853), Livorno, Grosseto, Siena, Perugia, Lucca, and Padua. He also helped to restore and protect frescoes. He worked on the frescoes in the Camposanto of Pisa and the frescoes by Taddeo di Bartolo in the sacristy of the church of San Francesco, Pisa. From 1869-1870, Botti was called to help restore the Giotto frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua. He had been hired by recommendation of a technical committee, consisting of the Marquis and art-critic Pietro Selvatico, the engineer Benvenuto Benvenisti and the sculptor Gradenigo. The work was then interrupted for a decade, and restarted in 1880 and continued till 1899 under Antonio Bertolli, a student of Botti. In 1873 he was nominated inspector of the Gallerie of Venice; and in 1883 director. From 1874 to 1887 he was resident academic of merit resident and professor of restorations and painting at the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice and in 1891 published the first catalogue of the works of art at the Gallerie of Venice."

He also held the post of Special Commissioner for the following emergencies: 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, volcanoes in the Aeolian Islands, maritime areas of Lampedusa, cleaning up the wreckage of the Haven tanker than sank in 1991, bionucleare risk, Cycling World Championships in Varese of 2008, the Presidency of the G8 summit in L'Aquila, and the Roman archaeological site. He has a degree in medicine, which he received from the University of Rome La Sapienza and subsequently obtained a Master of Science in Public Health at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. He worked with UNICEF for the health of children in tropical countries. In February 2016 he was selected to be mayoral candidate for the right wing, Lega Nord, Fratelli d'Italia & Forza Italia in Rome for the upcoming town and city elections. The more extreme right, Lega Nord, Fratelli d'Italia & more to the right people in Forza Italia such as Alessandra Mussolini had some problem with him that resulted in the Fratelli d'Italia leader Giorgia Meloni running for mayor and being endorsed by Lega Nord. Finally Bertolaso withdrew from the race and Berlusconi endorsed Marchini. Surveys were showing a support rate of about 20% putting him a few percentages behind both the Democratic and the Five Stars candidates. The Five Star Movement candidate remains the frontrunner and will if elected be the first woman mayor of Rome."
