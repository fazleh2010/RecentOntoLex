  "text" : "Hervey De Witt Griswold was born on May 24, 1860 in Dryden, New York to Benjamin and Laura Eliza (Hurd) Griswold. He attended Union College in Schenectady, New York from 1881 to 1885, and then went to Union Theological Seminary in New York City from 1885 to 1888. During the following two years Griswold had a fellowship at Oxford and Berlin Universities. Griswold began his 36-year-long career as a missionary in 1890 in Jhansi, India as a representative of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church. In 1894 Griswold became Professor of Philosophy at Forman Christian College in Lahore, India (now Pakistan), teaching English and history there as well. As its librarian Griswold built the Foreman Christian College Library, adding a substantial number of books on religion and philosophy to the collection. Griswold also served as secretary of the India Council of the Presbyterian Missions. In 1900 Griswold received his Ph.D. from Cornell University, based on his thesis on the Indian Philosophy known as Brahman. In 1910 Griswold obtained his Doctor of Divinity. A prolific writer, he wrote about Hinduism and other Indian religions. He also wrote about the Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, at a time when Ahmad was alive, and critically analyzed his claims to be the promised Messiah and Mahdi. In 1890 Griswold married Frances S. Sheldon. Together they had three children: Laura Katharine; Arthur Sheldon; and Frances Louise.

He was made a Canon of Wrocław on 31 August 1290 and supported King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and his relative Jan Muskata, Bishop of Kraków in the dynastic struggles of the day. He was made Bishop in 1302 by the pope and he was the first of the Bishops of Wroclaw to take the princely title. His time in office was notable for his organization of a Court of the Inquisition in 1315the result of which included burning at the stake more than 50 people convicted of heresy in the towns of Wroclaw, Swidnica and Nysa. His inquisition was particularly against Beguines and Beghards. He died 23 September 1319. and was buried in the Wrocław Cathedral. Due to competing claims a replacement Bishop was not appointed for seven years following his death and the dicocese was administered by his canon Nicholas of Banz."

  "text" : "Helen Hunt was a hair stylist in Hollywood movies from the 1930s up to 1967, when she worked on Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. She was the chief hair stylist for Columbia Pictures. Hunt fell into her career by accident. She was working as a stenographer for a costume company in Omaha, Nebraska. She began washing and arranging the company's wigs on her own time because they were being neglected. When she went into a shop to look over a display of wigs, she was offered a job by the owner, George Westmore of Hollywood. This eventually led to a position with Columbia Pictures. According to IMDb, the first film with which she was involved (uncredited) was the 1935 Party Wire, starring Jean Arthur. She worked with Rita Hayworth before the latter became a star. According to some sources, it was Hunt who came up with the idea to dye Hayworth's black hair auburn. She also arranged for the painful, lengthy electrolysis that raised Hayworth's hairline. For the 1946 film noir Gilda, Hunt stated, \"I got fan mail - and hate mail - about Rita's hair! Some clergymen declared that I would go to hell for contributing to evil because of Rita's hair in Gilda!\" When Orson Welles insisted on shortening the actress's long hair (and dyeing it blonde) for The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Hunt was flown in from New York, where she was on her honeymoon, to do the cutting. During the course of her career, she also styled such stars as Irene Dunne, Rosalind Russell, Loretta Young and Evelyn Keyes. Cult movie actress Pamela Duncan credited Hunt with bringing her to the attention of the casting department of Columbia."

Walton was born in New York City on October 8, 1768, the son of Jacob and Mary (Cruger) Walton. The Waltons were a prominent New York City family. Educated in England, Walton returned to New York in about 1788 and studied law under Aaron Burr. In 1790 he moved to Ballston, New York. There he served as surrogate court judge, where he was known as Judge Henry Walton. In 1815 he built a mansion called Pine Grove on Broadway in Saratoga Springs, New York, across from the present City Center. This property was sold in 1823 to Chancellor Reuben Hyde Walworth and was later inherited by Walworth's daughter-in-law Ellen Hardin Walworth. In 1816, Walton built the estate he called \"Wood Lawn,\" which he sold to Henry Hilton. Walton was a large land owner in the area, and donated land for the First Presbyterian Church, the Universalist Church, and the Methodist Church in Saratoga Springs. In 1819 he built the Pavilion Hotel on Broadway, on the site of the present City Hall. The hotel burned down around 1840 and was not rebuilt. He was also involved in developing the famous springs of Saratoga, tubing the Flat Rock Spring, and the President, later called the Iodine and the Saratoga Star Spring. He was married first to Pernette Sara de Maffe, who died in 1798. In 1800 he married Mrs. Mathilda (Cruger) Yates, by whom he had Jacob, Mary, Henry (1806–1865), Jared, Cruger, Mathilda, and William Henry. His son Henry later became a well-known artist in Ithaca, New York. Walton's third wife was Mrs. Margaret Kearney, by whom he had Susan, Jared, and Susan K. Henry Walton died in New York City on September 15, 1844, and is buried in the Trinity churchyard."

  "text" : "Hugh I of Oisy (died circa 1111) was the castellan of the town of Cambrai and a famous rebel against the authority of the bishops of the city. Hugh's family was of seigneurial rank, originating in Oisy and Inchy, and had provided most of the castellans of Cambrai during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Before 1076, Hugh rebelled against the bishop Lietbert and was excommunicated. The bishop refused to lift the ban \"unless [Hugh] first consents to renounce with his own hands—werpire, to use the common expression—every fief which he holds in the city of Cambrai.\" The ceremony of werpitio (in French déguerpissement) generally involved handing over a symbol of the fief to the one from whom it had been received. Hugh continued to encroach on the authority of the bishop within the city during the episcopate of Gerard II. Since both the French king, Philip I, and the dowager countess of Hainaut, Richilda, were opposed to increased imperial influence—represented by the bishop of Cambrai—in the county of Flanders, they supported Hugh in his rebellion. With the help of Richilda's rival, Count Robert I of Flanders, the bishop succeeded in exiling Hugh to England between about 1086 and 1090."

Bhati's invention earned him the CavinKare Ability Special Recognition Award and the Sri Balaji Society's Child Innovator Award. He has subsequently designed and received patents for twelve- and sixty-player variants of his game with his boards creating 100 separate chess variants altogether. Besides inventions in circular chess, he has developed a ramp system enabling easy access to vehicles for the disabled. In 2014, he was awarded a Dr. Batra's Positive Health Award which was presented by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Bhati suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy and is a wheelchair user. He attributes his inspiration for inventing to his admiration of British physicist Stephen Hawking: \"I want to be like Hawking who became a famous scientist despite suffering from motor neuron disease.\""

He creates pedagogical videos, eBooks and MP3 files that are based on these conversations. Burton holds a Ph.D. in theoretical physics and an M.A. in philosophy. Howard was the founding Executive Director of Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada, from 1999-2007. As Executive Director of Perimeter, Howard created a top international centre for research and outreach. Howard has extensive experience in communicating sophisticated ideas to students and to the general public. He has given a wide variety of presentations to group audiences. To ensure the community had an opportunity to become actively involved in the science and discovery of the Institute, Howard initiated several educational outreach programs. In addition, he hosted a popular monthly public lecture series (500 attendants each time), an International Summer School, the annual Einstein Plus Teachers’ Workshop and numerous student and teacher seminars. Howard interacted extensively with organizations and government bodies at local, regional, provincial, national and international levels. Additionally, he promoted science and education through the media – participating with CBC Radio and Television, CTV News, TV Ontario, CNN International, MSNBC and other international broadcasters. He also contributed a regular column to The Kitchener-Waterloo Record for many years and has been published in various other media, including Canadian Architect and The Times of India. Dr Burton is a former board member of the Kitchener Waterloo Symphony and has been involved in a host of other community initiatives. Howard received a Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Waterloo. His book, First Principles: The Crazy Business of Doing Serious Science, tells the history of the founding years of Perimeter Institute (second edition in Kindle format is called First Principles: Building Perimeter Institute) . The memoir Burning Down UNESCO: An Innovative Guide to Fundraising is about what happens when a skeptical physicist finds himself tasked with fundraising for UNESCO. Howard invokes his sense of strategy and humour to invert the standard fundraising approach: concentrating first on what should be done with the money before considering how best to attain it."

He moved to Ithaca before 1836, where he is believed to be working for a company republishing David Burr's 1829 Atlas of New York State. He produced both portraits and landscapes including View of Geneva (1837), Henry Clay (1844), Lithographic View of Jefferson (1847) (Jefferson is now Watkins Glen), and oil paintings of Addison (1850) and Painted Post (1851). In 1840, during his stay in Ithaca, he was involved in a dispute over a portrait of William Henry Harrison, which political opponents claimed was actually a portrait of Andrew Jackson over which Walton had written the name Harrison. In 1851 he joined the California Gold Rush, arriving in San Francisco on the steamer Oregon. In California he continued producing artistic works such as the watercolor View of Grass Valley (1857), and presumably other works which have been lost. In 1857 he moved to Michigan, where he died in Cassopolis 1865. His wife Jane Orr died there in 1890. There is no record of children."

In 2013 he resigned from the Milliyet newspaper after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had criticised his article supporting Milliyet's publication of minutes of a parliamentary visit to Abdullah Öcalan, and Milliyet suspended him and refused to publish his returning column. He is known for acknowledging and apologizing for the Armenian Genocide, a crime which was perpetrated in part by his grandfather and his colleagues. His 2012 book on the subject (written in response to the 2007 assassination of his friend Hrant Dink) is titled 1915: Ermeni Soykırımı (English: 1915: Armenian Genocide)."

His California Suite, also from the 1950s, was performed in San Francisco and in Brussels. According to the Grove Dictionary of Music, \"The influence of Milhaud – and sometimes echoes of Copland – can be heard in his music; a flair for orchestral writing, secure craftsmanship and sophisticated wit are also in evidence.\" He wrote liner notes for many of his brother's commercial recordings, and transcribed, edited, and arranged much of his brother's music for publication. Howard Brubeck was born July 11, 1916 in Concord, California and died February 16, 1993 in La Mesa, California. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Music from San Francisco State College in 1938 and a Master of Arts in Music from Mills College in 1941, studying with Darius Milhaud, and Domenico Brescia. He taught high school briefly and then became Milhaud's assistant at Mills College. At Mills Brubeck also wrote incidental music for various French plays produced by Milhaud's wife Madeleine. In 1950 Brubeck was appointed composition instructor at San Diego State College. He was hired as Chairman of the music department of Palomar Junior College in San Marcos, California in 1953 and promoted to Dean of Humanities in 1966. He retired in 1978. The Brubeck Theater at Palomar College is named in his honor and work there."

He worked in calligraphy, traditional Chinese painting, and seal-carving, but was primarily a publisher, producing academic texts as well as records of his own work. Hu lived in Nanjing during the transition from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty. A Ming loyalist, he was offered a position at the rump court of the Hongguang Emperor, but declined the post, and never held anything more than minor political office. He did, however, design the Hongguang Emperor's personal seal, and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor's capture and death in 1645. He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten Bamboo Studio, in which he practised various multi-colour printing and embossing techniques, and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise. Hu's work at the Ten Bamboo Studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking, leading to delicate gradations of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form. Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled The Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy, an artist's primer which remained in print for around 200 years. His studio also published seal catalogues, academic and medical texts, books on poetry, and decorative writing papers. Many of these were edited and prefaced by Hu and his brothers."

  "text" : "Hugh of Balma, also known as Hugo of Balma or Hugh of Dorche was a Carthusian theologian, generally acknowledged to be the author of the work which is generally entitled Viae Syon Lugent (The Roads to Zion Mourn), after its opening line, but is also known as De Mystica Theologia, De Theologia Mystica and De Triplici Via. It is a comprehensive treatment of the Mystical Theology of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. The work was attributed to Saint Bonaventure in medieval and early modern times, but this attribution was firmly rejected and attributed to Hugh by the editors of the critical edition of Bonaventure's work, the Franciscans of Quarrachi, in 1895. The identity of Hugh is unclear. Since the seventeenth century, he has typically been identified with Hugh of Dorche, prior of the Carthusian Charterhouse of Meyriat in Bresse, between Geneva and Lyon, from 1293-5 and 1303-5. More recently, Harald Walach has argued that this identification is flawed. He thinks it unlikely that the prior of an out-of-the-way charterhouse like Meyriat would have had the detailed knowledge of scholastic philosophy and theology that he detects in Viae Syon Lugent. Instead, he suggests that Hugh of Balma (or, better, Hugh of Palma) should not be identified with Hugh of Dorche, but was instead an Englishman, educated in Oxford, who studied in Paris in the 1250s, and was not a Carthusian. However, this alternative theory has not found wider favour in recent works. The 1907 Catholic Encyclopedia cites a tradition now discredited that Hugh of Balma was a 'Franciscan theologian, born at Genera' who died in 1439, and the confessor of St Colette. The most likely theory remains that which sees him as a Carthusian prior of Meyriat, identifying him with Hugh of Dorche. Although the work Viae Syon Lugent is likely to have been written in the second half of the thirteenth century, it is hard to date more precisely. It is likely to have been written subsequently to Thomas Gallus’s Explanatio Mysticae Theologiae (ca.1241?), from which Hugh quotes, but was composed before the death in 1297 of the Frenchman Guigo of Ponte, who in his De Contemplatione alludes to Hugh’s work. Walach argues that Hugh's writing is influenced by certain works by Bonaventure, written around 1260, but it is possible that both Hugh and Bonaventure were simply drawing on the same sources of the Dionysian tradition. Therefore, it is hard to be more precise than stating that the work was probably written between around 1240 and 1297. Hugh has generally been identified with the assertion that one can rise to God by love alone, without any cognition accompanying or leading the way. However, it has been suggested that this arose in particular because of a misreading of Hugh in the 1450s, during controversy over the definition of mystical theology involving the Carthusian Vincent of Aggsbach, Nicholas of Cusa and the abbot of the Benedictine monastery of Tegernsee, Bernard of Waging. Viae Syon Lugent may well have had impact on subsequent late medieval writers: more than one hundred full or partial manuscripts of Viae Syon Lugent survive. It received many Latin printings from the fifteenth century onwards, generally within collections of Bonaventure's works. In large part because it was understood to be by Bonaventure, it was partially translated into German in the fifteenth century. It was also printed in Spanish in Toledo in 1514 as Sol des contemplativos, an edition which influenced Francisco de Osuna's The Third Spiritual Alphabet, and perhaps subsequent Spanish Carmelite spiritual writing. It has been suggested that its thought may have influenced the author of The Cloud of Unknowing."

  "text" : "Hu Yinglin (Chinese: 胡應麟; 1551–1602), also known as Hu Yuanrui, was a Chinese scholar, writer and bibliophile during the late Ming dynasty. A native of Lanxi, he produced over 1,000 works of scholarship. His two most noted works are the Shaoshishan fang bicong 少室山房筆叢 (Notes from Shaoshishan Studio, a work of historical and literary criticism) and the Shisou 詩藪 (Thickets of criticism), which is a treatise on poetry. Hu earned the rank of juren (a low-level degree) in the Imperial Examinations of 1576. He travelled extensively collecting works for his personal library, the Eryou shanfang, often selling his clothes or his wife's jewellery in order to fund the purchase of texts. He eventually amassed a collection of more than 42,300 bamboo scrolls and around 20,000 paper books. In later life, prevented from travelling due to ill health, Hu created an \"armchair travel studio\" (wouyou shi); since he was unable to visit the Five Great Mountains, he had them painted on the walls of his room. He was one of the first critics of fiction, arguing that it was similar to philosophy. Hu divided fiction into six subgenres: \n*  Zhiguai, records of strange events \n*  Chuanqi, tales of the unusual \n*  Zalu, informal notes \n*  Congtan, collected discourses \n*  Bianding, textual inquiry \n*  Zhengui, rules and admonitions He was aware, however, that this categorisation was imperfect, since one work could fit into multiple categories, and his system failed to include plays and novels entirely. Hu was an admirer of the courtesan and artist Xue Susu, praising her \"lovely and elegant appearance\" and claiming that \"Even those famous painters with excellent skills cannot surpass her\"."

Since then, Hu has been the image for many top international fashion names such as Louis Vuitton, Dolce & Gabbana, Valentino, etc. Hu started his transition from the fashion runway to the TV screen in 1996 and became a household name after the success of the TV drama Love Talks (1999), in which he played the male leading role. Continuously from 2000 to 2005, Hu was voted one of the four most popular young actors in China (Hu left China to further strengthen his performing aptitude in an American institute in 2005). Hu is known for his on-screen portrayals in both China and Japan as an actor, and as a fashion icon all across Asia. Hu was a professional athlete, a national rowing champion by the age of 16, and a former member of the Chinese National Rowing Team. His athletic career ended after he suffered a back injury at the age of 19. In 1992, he became a professional runway model and was dubbed “the best male model in China” by the Valentino Garavani in 1993. In the early 2000s, due to his successful on-screen performances, Hu became a household name across Asia. At the same time, he was also a singer, TV producer, TV show host (In both China and Japan), and the former editor-in-chief of Harper’s Bazaar Men’s Style (China) magazine. In 2005, at the peak of his acting career, he left the spotlight to further strengthen his performing aptitude in a performance arts institution in the United States. In 2008, he returned to the Asian entertainment scene and played leading roles in Japanese and Chinese movies and TV dramas. During the 2010 International Rome Film Festival, Hu was nominated for the Best Actor award for his leading-role performance in the French-Hong Kong co-production (produced by Luc Besson), The Back (2010). The film also received a Best Picture nomination. Hu is also a philanthropist, helping with Chinese and international charity organizations and acts as the goodwill ambassador for some, especially for those that deal with underprivileged children and the disabled."

Later, as a colonel in 1945, Worgitzky commanded an ad-hoc brigade (later designated as a division) that was named for him (Brigade Worgitzky) and which saw action north of Kassel. Worgitzky was taken prisoner by the U.S. 8th Armored Division on 21 April 1945. After the war, Worgitzky was made vice-president of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) from 1957 until 1967 and worked for Reinhard Gehlen. During his tenure at the BND, Worgitzky was promoted to major-general in the Bundeswehr reserves. In 1965, Worgitzky flew to Egypt three times and eventually successfully obtained the release of German spy Gerhard Bauch, who had been arrested on suspicion of working with the Israelis. Worgitzky was held responsible by Gehlen for the Bauch affair and subsequently resigned from the BND. Several months after his resignation, Worgitzky died of a heart attack."

Along with his teacher Wen Peng, he was one of the first seal-engravers to use soapstone as a medium for his work. He Zhen was from Wuyuan County, but spent much of his time in Nanjing. He had a wide-ranging influence, and founded the Huizhou (Xingyuang) or Wan (Anhui) school of seal-carving. He's work aspired to an antique, ancient appearance, and he was known to chip or otherwise artificially weather his seals to create the impression of age. He created this effect by exploiting natural fracture lines in the stone, or by emphasising the knife-marks made whilst incising the inscription. His calligraphy attempted to echo that of the Han Dynasty, and he used the simplicity of that script to ameliorate the elaborate stylistic flourishes of the popular Yuan-style callligraphy that had previously been used for Ming-era seals."

  "text" : "Hardial Bains (Punjabi: ਹਰਦਿਆਲ ਬੈਂਸ) (15 August 1939 – 24 August 1997) was a microbiology student and teacher, primarily known as the founder of a series of left-wing movements and parties foremost of which was the Communist Party of Canada (Marxist–Leninist) (CPC (ML)). Presenting himself as staunchly anti-revisionist and pro-Stalinist, until his death, Bains acted the spokesperson and ideological leader of the CPC (ML) -- known in elections as the Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada. During span of his life, Bains' outlook swung from supporting the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, to Mao Zedong's China, then later to Enver Hoxa's Albania. Shortly before he died, and abandoning his previous sharp criticisms of the country, Bains turned to Fidel Castro's Cuba for inspiration. Spending most of his life in Canada, Bains was also politically active in England, Ireland and India."

  "text" : "Henry C. Groseclose was born on May 17, 1892. He lived in Ceres, Virginia for most of his life. Mr. Groseclose completed his junior college degree from Washington and Lee University in 1917. In his later years, he also received his bachelor’s degree, as well as his master’s degree, in agricultural education from Virginia Tech. While Mr. Groseclose was an agriculture teacher at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, he, along with three other agriculture teachers, Walter Newman, Edmund Magill and Harry Sanders, decided to establish a club for the farm boys in the school. The organization was fired up in 1925. Groseclose named the organization the Future Farmers of Virginia, or FFV for short. The original meaning for the abbreviation FFV stood for the First Families of Virginia. The “first families” referred to the families of both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Referring to Washington and Jefferson, Groseclose once stated that, “The Future Farmers of America should follow the example of these great sons of early Virginia by using scientific knowledge, intelligence, and enthusiasm to the end that agriculture may again be known as the profession of the real aristocrat.” Groseclose wrote the by-laws, as well as the constitution that the FFV would be based on. In 1926, he also wrote, and brought into play, the formal ceremony that would take place as an organizational pattern to structure each meeting. Two years later, in 1928, the FFV became a nationwide organization. This developed the organization that is known today as the Future Farmers of America, or The National FFA Organization, or just FFA for short. The by-laws drawn up by Henry Groseclose became the foundation of the newly national organization. Also, the formal ceremony that Groseclose developed was taken on by the FFA as a national ritual that is still used today. Groseclose was a seventh degree Grange member, and he was also involved with the Masons, so it was no surprise when he developed levels of memberships for the FFV, which transferred through to the FFA, that were similar to the three leveled membership structure that the Masons uses. These three levels included the Greenhand, the Virginia Farmer and the Virginia Planter. While the official emblem of the National FFA Organization was being drawn, Groseclose’s original emblem, which he hand drew himself, was highly considered and ended up playing a part in the emblem that is still the emblem of the National FFA Organization today. The part of the emblem that was from Mr. Groseclose’s original drawing included a background setting of a half plowed wheat field with an owl perched upon a spade of wheat in front of the field. Henry Groseclose served as the Executive Secretary of the National FFA Organization for two years between 1928 and 1930. During his office of Executive Secretary, he announced at the national convention of 1930 that he had written, and would be releasing, an official FFA manual, which outlined the organization, procedures and structures of the National FFA Organization. Mr. Groseclose also served as the Treasurer of the National FFA Organization for 11 years, between 1930 and 1941. In September 1925, Henry Groseclose set his expectations for the members of the FFV, and the purpose of the establishment of the Future Farmers of Virginia was by saying, \"In my opinion the farm boys of Virginia who are enrolled in vocational agriculture are equal to any other group of boys in the state. But somehow the boys themselves seem to have a feeling of inferiority. Especially is this true when the farm boy goes to the city and has to compete with his city cousin. This condition should not exist. I believe that a strong organization of our boys in agriculture would help them to overcome this handicap. Let's form an organization that will give them a greater opportunity for self-expression and for the development of leadership. In this way they will develop confidence in their own ability and pride in the fact that they are farm boys.\" Mr. Henry C. Groseclose died on June 4 of 1950. In 2002, the Department of Historic Resources established a marker in Mr. Groseclose’s honor. It is Marker number KC-5 and it is displayed in Bland County of Ceres, Virginia."

The second was the Chocolate Cream Poisoner case, where Christiana Edmunds poisoned a number of people in Brighton by lacing chocolates with strychnine. From 1895-1901 he sat as a Moderate Party alderman on the London County Council. Sir Harry Bodkin Poland replaced his uncle Sir William Henry Bodkin as the Recorder of the Borough of Dover.

  "text" : "Haoui Montaug (1952 – 7 June 1991) was a doorman of the New York City nightclubs Hurrah, Danceteria, Studio 54 and the Palladium. Montaug also ran a roving cabaret revue called \"No Entiendes\" (\"You Don't Understand\") (originally named \"I Dunno\"), which showcased a young Madonna and early performances by the Beastie Boys. At the time of his death Montaug was Panel Director of the New Music Seminar (NMS). Following his death the NMS inaugurated the Haoui Montaug New Music Awards in his honour. In the late 1980s Montaug was the doorman for the Paradise Garage club. His skills at choosing who went on the guest list at the Garage were described as a \"'willy nilly' affair with little logic or reason\". Simon Topping of the British dance project Quando Quango had to rely on his banter to get past Montaug and get permission for the group to perform at the Garage. Montaug's writings appeared in the magazines Details, Paper and I.D.. In addition to his writing, Montaug appeared in the films Krush Groove, Cookie and Edo Bertoglio's Downtown 81. Suffering from AIDS, in June 1991 Montaug invited 20 guests to celebrate his suicide at his loft apartment in the Bowery neighborhood in Manhattan. His apartment was located at the corner of the Bowery and East 2nd Street. In addition to the guests present, Madonna was at the party via telephone from Los Angeles. Montaug had previously introduced Madonna at the performance for her music video for \"Everybody\" in the early 1980s. At the gathering Montaug swallowed five Seconal barbiturate pills, and went into a deep laboured sleep, but kept breathing, to the dismay of the guests. His guests remained the next morning when he awoke in a fury. Montaug finally swallowed 20 more pills and died within half an hour. He was survived by his mother and sister."

  "text" : "Hannah Holliday Stewart (January 25, 1924 – February 23, 2010) was an American abstract sculptor who was a prominent member of the Houston art scene and exhibited across the United States, including at the Smithsonian Institution. She was part of a generation of second-wave feminist artists who incorporated ancient myths and goddess imagery into their work, depicting the woman as a dominant player in a new societal order. Twenty years before her death, Stewart moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico to live in seclusion. She continued to produce sculptures, primarily in bronze, until her death in 2010. Stewart was born in Birmingham, Alabama. She grew up in a family of wealthy socialites, but quickly shed this identity upon leaving home. After getting her graduate degree from the Cranbrook Academy of Art, she moved to Houston. There she received a public art commission for a sculpture in Hermann Park, an unlikely honor for an abstract female sculptor at the time and the first of many monumental works she would produce throughout her career. The artist was inspired by both mythology and science. In a handwritten statement discovered in her personal files after her death she wrote: (An) early interest in natural forces has sustained me throughout my life as a sculptor. My goal is to render visible the hidden realities of pent-up contained energy. The direct fields of reference are Sacred Geometry, Astronomy, Myth & Physics ... Each Sculpture is an energy form, the movement arrested in space, a form sustaining an energy. My work is a response to these patterns and delineations and communicates with viewers through the universality of symbolism and form. The sculptor's work is characterized by dynamic ascending lines and rough planes. The titles of her abstract works and the subject matter of her figurative works often refer to mythical and historic female heroes, from Egyptian queens to Greek goddesses. Stewart's oeuvre explores ideas of the sacred feminine, intersecting with the ideologies of contemporary female artists including Ana Mendieta, Dona Henes and Carolee Schneemann. She gained national renown as part of this new generation of women artists, exhibiting at the Smithsonian Institution, the San Francisco Museum of Art, the High Museum of Art, the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts and more. About two decades before her death, Stewart abruptly left Houston for Albuquerque, a move that remains a mystery to many of her friends in Texas. Outside of Houston, Stewart remains largely forgotten by the art establishment. Still, the artist was hugely influential in her time. In her book \"American Women Sculptors\", Charlotte Streifer Rubinstein wrote: Breaking from religious expressions in which the male principle acts as a form of oppressive domination, a number of women artists... turned for inspiration to goddess imagery and ancient female deities. In sculpture, painting, and ritual, they revived the image of woman as shaman, deity, powerful creator and generator of life."

  "text" : "Helen LaFrance is a self-taught African-American artist born November 4, 1919 in Graves County, Kentucky, the second of four daughters to James Franklin Orr and Lillie May Ligon Orr. Though the terms are confining, Helen is often described as both an outsider artist due to her lack of formal training and existence outside the cultural mainstream and as a folk artist best known for her memory painting of the disappearing lifestyle of the rural South. She also painted powerful and intensely spiritual visionary interpretations of the Bible, in a style that differed radically from her memory paintings. LaFrance grew up in a nurturing household under Jim Crow laws, which between 1876 and 1965 prescribed segregation and disadvantaged social, economic and educational conditions for African Americans in the United States. Her father owned and farmed his land, growing tobacco, corn, black-eyed peas, beans, peanuts and sorghum, in a time when share-cropping was customary. Her parents bought school books to teach her at home and, after her chores were completed, she drew and carved in her spare time. Her artistic bent was encouraged from childhood and she always followed her mother's wisdom to \"paint what you know.\" She went to school in fifth grade, but later left to work on the farm. When her mother died, she left home to take various jobs in a hospital, caring for children, cooking, working in the tobacco barns and a ceramic factory where she decorated brand-name whiskey bottles. In her 40s, she made enough money to buy art supplies at the grocery store and in 1986 she began painting full-time. Not limited to two-dimensional media, LaFrance is an exceptional quilt maker and wood carver of animal sculptures and articulated dolls with handmade textile clothing. But it is her memory paintings that most strongly suggest a common experience. \"Simply described, memory painting is a visual history of reminiscences coming from a particular frame of reference.\" Her sense of time and place resonate with the emotions and memories of the viewer, pulling him in. With oil on canvas, LaFrance shares the traditions of family and church and the values she grew up with, and recollections of coon hunts, fishing, planting and picking cotton and tobacco, growing flowers and using their petals for paint, the general merchandise store, barn dances, the circus, fish fries, family reunions, and church picnics where the community gathered together. She witnessed the Depression, the stock market crash, the war in Vietnam, and the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It is that blend of personal experiences and expressive artistry that makes Helen LaFrance a unique and an important American artist. LaFrance's work is represented in many notable public and private collections in this country and in Europe, including Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Bryant Gumbel and contemporary artist Red Grooms. Her work has been shown at county fairs, at the Mayfield, Kentucky bank and public library, Murray State University, the Kentucky Museum (Bowling Green), the National Black Fine Arts Show (New York City), and Color, an art show sponsored by Oprah Winfrey in Chicago. Her depiction of workers rolling cut tobacco is included in the Van Nelle collection of tobacco art in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, purchased on a visit to the Kentucky tobacco barn where she worked. The Owensboro Museum of Fine Art holds examples of her work in its collection and featured her in a cataloged show in 1991 called \"Kentucky Spirit, the Naive Tradition.\" The Kentucky Folk Art Center in Morehead also owns her work and has included her in its exhibitions. The subject of a Kentucky Educational Television (KET) program and other documentaries, she received the prestigious Folk Heritage Award for 2011, one of the Governor's Awards in the Arts presented by the Kentucky Arts Council. She is featured in a chapter of Kathy Moses' reference book, Outsider Art of the South. Her life and her work were documented in the award-winning screenplay by Marilyn Jaye Lewis, Tell My Bones: The Helen LaFrance Story. Today in her 90s, Helen LaFrance resides in a Kentucky nursing home and says of her days, \"When I'm not eating or sleeping, I'm painting.\""

  "text" : "Hitto of Freising (died 835) was the sixth Bishop of Freising from December 811 to 835. He was descended from the Huosi family, part of the Bavarian upper aristocracy (Hochadel). In 794, the cleric became the deacon of Freising Cathedral and was frequently named as a witness in the Freising documents. He is first recorded as Bishop of Freising in 812, his predecessor, Atto, however, had died over a year earlier. During his time in office, the monk and notary, Kozroh, compiled the first Freising Book of Traditions (Freisinger Traditionsbuch), which went back to 744. Under Hitto, the Freising scriptorium reached a special high point; for example, about 40 codices were written. In addition, over 300 documents from Hitto's time in office have survived. Hitto clearly strove to establish episcopal supremacy over the many, hitherto aristocratic, independent monasteries within the diocese (such as Schliersee Abbey in 817 Schäftlarn Abbey in 821 or 828, and Innichen Abbey in 822). He was also the founder of Weihenstephan Abbey around 830. According to an old tradition, during his pilgrimage to Rome in 834 Hitto was given the relics of Saint Justin by Pope Gregory IV, and brought them to Freising. Hitto was buried in the cathedral crypt at Freising; his sarcophagus is preserved. His nephew Erchanbert became his successor."

Lawrence's bold and dramatic accomplishments at both airlines earned him the reputation as not only a maverick of the transportation industry but as one of the last legendary titans of aviation. While at Braniff, Lawrence turned the conservative airline into a progressive and flamboyant carrier known for high fashion flight attendant uniforms, exemplary inflight service, and brightly painted planes. Lawrence' revolutionary approach included approving the \"End of the Plain Plane\" campaign in 1965, which called for imaginative aircraft paint schemes, interiors, and never before seen passenger service comforts. Previous airlines were commonly patterned after less than appealing military operations."

  "text" : "Hannah Kent (born 1985) is an Australian writer. In 2011 she won the inaugural Writing Australia Unpublished Manuscript Award for her novel Burial Rites. Published in May 2013, it tells the story of Agnes Magnúsdóttir, a servant in northern Iceland who was condemned to death after the murder of two men, one of whom was her employer, and became the last woman put to death in Iceland. Kent was drawn to the idea of writing her story after a visit to the scene of the woman's execution in a lonely area of Iceland, close to where she stayed for some time as a Rotary student when she was 18. The novel crafts a more ambiguous, sympathetic image of the life of a woman widely regarded in popular opinion to have been 'an inhumane witch, stirring up murder'. Burial Rites was shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award, and for the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction (2014). A documentary about Kent's experiences in Iceland and writing Burial Rites was aired on ABC1 as an episode of Australian Story titled 'No More Than a Ghost,' on 1 July 2013. Her second novel The Good People (2016) is set in Ireland's County Kerry in 1825. It is the story of widow's struggle to find a cure for her grandson who has been struck down by a mysterious inability to speak and who is feared by others in this superstitious community as a changeling. In 2010, Kent co-founded the Australian literary journal Kill Your Darlings. She is completing a creative writing PhD at Flinders University."

In 1863 he obtained his doctorate in zoology at the University of Greifswald, later becoming an associate professor of zoology at the Academy in Münster (1873). In 1871 he founded the Westfälischen Vereins für Vogelschutz, Geflügel- und Singvögelzucht (Westphalian Association for bird protection, poultry and songbird breeding), and during the following year founded the Zoologischen sektion für Westfalen und Lippe (Zoological Division of Westphalia and Lippe). In 1875 he founded the Westphalian zoo in Munster, a preserve with emphasis on European domestic mammals. It had a building for the display, cultivation and breeding of various fowl as well as avaries for songbirds. In 1876 a \"monkey house\" was constructed. Eventually, the zoo expanded to include native fauna in general. By the end of 1882, the site had \"niche displays\" (dioramas) representing fauna from Australia, the North Sea coast, German forests, the African landscape, as well as a section that contained fossils from prehistoric Westphalia."

  "text" : "Harry Willson (23 July 1932 – 9 March 2010) was a writer of fiction, satire, social commentary, and philosophy, and co-founder of Amador Publishers in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Willson was born in Montoursville, Pennsylvania. He attended Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, and received a B.A. in chemistry and mathematics. He received a master's of divinity at Princeton Theological Seminary and studied Spanish at University of Madrid. He moved to New Mexico in 1958 with his wife and three children, and he served as Spanish-speaking Presbyterian missionary for eight years. Willson's views toward the church slowly changed, and he left the ministry in 1966. He became a teacher of history, English, and philosophy at Albuquerque Academy from 1966-1973 and at Sandia Prep from 1973-1976. For the next ten years, Willson wrote books and worked different jobs, including owning a worm ranch, selling produce from an organic garden, selling fireplace heater-inserts, and helping his wife open a drapery business. In 1986, he founded Amador Publishers  with his wife, Adela Amador, and in 2006, Willson and Amador changed Amador Publishers to Amador Publishers, LLC, with Zelda Gordon as co-owner and managing editor. Amador Publishers, LLC, has published more than thirty titles from more than fifteen authors, including Gene H. Bell-Villada, Donald Gutierrez, and Eva Krutein. Willson believed his authors emphasized themes he valued, peace, ecology, harmony, and feminism."

  "text" : "Hugo Gutierrez, Jr. (January 29, 1927 – June 12, 2013) was a Filipino jurist and civil liberties advocate. Gutierrez served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines May 14, 1982 - March 31, 1993.He had to resign in disgrace because of plagiarism that dealt with the Supreme Court Case with Eastern Telecommunications Philippines v. PLDT Decision. This plagiarism was uncovered by a young attorney, Arthur Lim, who is now part of COMELEC. He worked in the Office of the Solicitor General before joining the Supreme Court. Gutierrez was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1982. He and his fellow Supreme Court justices resigned from the High Court following the People Power Revolution, which ousted Marcos and brought Corazon Aquino to power. Gutierrez was one of just three sitting justices who were reappointed to the Supreme Court by President Aquino following her reorganization of the court. Gutierrez died from complications related to diabetes on June 12, 2013, at the age of 86. He was laid in state at the Sanctuarium on Araneta Avenue in Manila."

  "text" : "Harry T. Hayward (c. 1865 - December 12, 1895) was an American socialite, gambler, arsonist, and murderer during the Victorian Era. Due to his ability to manipulate others, the newspapers of the era dubbed Hayward, \"The Minneapolis Svengali,\" \"the most cold-blooded murderer that ever walked God's footstool\", and, \"the most bloodthirsty soul ever to usurp the human frame.\" Hayward is best known as the mastermind of one of 19th century America's most infamous crimes—the 1894 murder for hire of dressmaker Catherine \"Kitty\" Ging. In the hours before his hanging at Hennepin County Jail in Minneapolis, Hayward gave a detailed interview to his cousin Edward Goodsell and a court reporter. He admitted to numerous arsons, assaults, swindles, and three unsolved murders. Historian and true crime writer Jack El-Hai has written that, if Hayward's admissions are true, then he predates Dr. H. H. Holmes as America's first documented serial killer."

He was assassinated on 26 September 1990 by leftwing revolutionary group Dev Sol. According to an article in the leftist pro-Kurdish Kurtuluş magazine, MIT deputy chief Hiram Abas was present at the 1977 Taksim Square massacre. (Swiss historian Daniele Ganser says that Abas was a CIA agent; the CIA's station chief in Istanbul, Duane Clarridge, spoke glowingly of him.) Hiram Abas had been trained in the US in covert action operations and as an MIT agent first gained notoriety in Beirut, where he co-operated with the Mossad from 1968 to 1971 and carried out attacks, \"targeting left-wing youths in the Palestinian camps and receiving bounty for the results he achieved in actions\". Abas is also said to have led a Lebanese unit against the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, consisting only of MİT operatives and members of the Special Warfare Department (special forces). Doğan Yurdakul and Soner Yalçın produced a biography of Abas, Mr Pipe - an MIT Officer's Unusual Life."

He was the son of Hans Heinrich Scheel (1668-1738) and Benedicte Dorothea Gjordsdatter (1684-1752). He served as Chamberlain at the Danish Royal Court. In 1752 he became a lieutenant colonel and Commandant of Fredrikstad Fortress from 1766 to 1774. Scheel was the first owner to make Frogner Manor (Frogner hovedgård) his permanent residence. He had purchased the estate in 1747. However, construction costs at Frogner exceeded his financial ability and he was forced him to sell the manor in 1760. He was married to Catharine Christine von Brüggemann (1725-1800) and was the father of Frederik Otto Scheel (1748–1803). He died at Fredrikstad in Østfold, Norway."

Delannoy grew up in Guéret, France, the son of a military accountant. After taking the baccalaureate in 1849, he studied mathematics in Bourges, near where his family lived, and after continuing his studies in Paris entered the École Polytechnique in 1853. He served as a lieutenant in the French artillery in the Second Italian War of Independence, in 1859, and became a captain in 1863. He continued to serve in the military, but shifted from the artillery to the supply corps; he served in Africa, became governor of a military hospital in Algeria, participated in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and eventually became an intendant in Orléans before retiring in 1889. His military decorations include the cross and officer's rosette of the Legion of Honour, awarded in 1868 and 1886 respectively. Beginning in 1879, Delannoy began a correspondence with Édouard Lucas on the subject of recreational mathematics and probability theory; he eventually published eleven mathematics articles. Along with his mathematical interests, Delannoy wrote about local history, painted, and from 1896 to 1915 served as the president of the Société des Sciences Naturelles et archéologiques de la Creuse."

He came under criticism for his writings and advocacy from some conservative groups including religious right groups and the John Birch Society who attacked Lyon and \"Humanistic Education\" as being \"anti-Christian\" in their newsletter which resulted in a number of Congressional inquiries to the then U.S. Secretary of Education, Ted Bell, who defended Lyon. Rogers, David Aspy, Lyon and other advocates began to move away from the less popular label \"Humanistic Education\" to call the movement \"Person-centered\" teaching. Lyon's books, Learning to Feel – Feeling to Learn and It’s Me & I’m Here! have forewords by his mentor, the late Carl R. Rogers, and his book, Tenderness Is Strength has a foreword by the late John Denver.

  "text" : "Hiroaki Takahashi (also known as Shotei) (1871–1945) was a 20th-century Japanese woodblock artist in the shin-hanga art movement. Hiroaki Takahashi was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1871. As a young artist he assumed the artistic name Shotei. As with many Japanese woodblock artists over his lifetime he signed his work with various names and worked for several publishing companies. After studying art, Shotei and Terazaki Kogyo founded the Japan Youth Painting Society in 1889. In 1907, as a successful artist, he was recruited by Shōzaburō Watanabe to contribute to the Shin Hanga (\"New Prints\") art movement in Japan. Watanabe helped to fulfill the Western demand for Ukiyoe woodblock prints which would be similar to familiar historical masters of that genre, including Hiroshige. In about 1921 Shotei added the artistic name of Hiroaki. In 1923 the Great Kanto earthquake (and subsequent fire) destroyed Watanabe's facilities; this included all Shin Hanga woodblocks. Thus, Shotei recreated prior designs destroyed in the Great Kanto earthquake and also continued to produce new woodblocks. He is believed to have died in 1945. Since Watanabe produced artwork for Western collectors there are numerous copies of Shotei woodblocks in Western museums including the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts."

  "text" : "Herbert J. Ellis (born in Dulwich, London, 4 July 1865, died 13 October 1903 in St. Thomas' Hospital, London) was a banjo player, a mandolinist, guitar player and a composer. Music historian Philip J. Bone called him \"without question the most fertile English composer and arranger for mandolin and guitar.\" He was the author of a banjo method, a guitar method, and a Tutor for Mandolin (1892), which he wrote while still in school. Ellis was the son of a licensed victualler, and received no musical instruction beyond that given by his mother, who had been a pupil of Sir Julius Benedict; she taught her son the piano and harmony. He became the delighted owner of a banjo as a boy and said that, \"Having the infatuation (for the banjo), I learnt several tunes out of my piano tutor, and then occurred to me the idea of writing my own music for it. Gradually growing ambitious, I did not rest until I had written an instruction book, which, in due course saw the light and without being egotistical, I think I can safely say that it was from the advent of my Thorough school that the banjo began to be popular.\" His parents had planned a business career for him, but after his banjo method was published (by J. A. Turner, London), he was well positioned as an author and composer. He wrote for the banjo during a growing popularity for the instrument in 1884 and onwards. When the mandolin and guitar began to grow popular as well, he added these instruments, about 1888. The demand for his compositions and methods grew and thousands of copies sold, as well as sheet music. His mandolin method was the first printed in England, and to the general surprise it ran through several editions. Bone credited it with being the preliminary work that helped to establish the instrument's popularity in England. His Thorough school for the guitar found favor amongst teachers and players amidst a guitar revival that followed the banjo and mandolin. Bone said that Ellis's method for the guitar was the simplest and best issued (as of 1914) because of its \"unique and simple manner of arrangement, by its explicit diagrams and judicious sequence of studies.\" During the period of his first publications, Ellis taught the instruments as well. His career was cut short in his thirties by his premature death. Bone eulogized him and his place in music in England: \"To him was given the faculty for expressing himself in the simplest and most attractive manner, and his total avoidance of technical difficulties made his compositions of particular attraction to beginners, and his name quite familiar to all English players of these instruments. Speaking generally, his writings were not advanced in style, but on the other hand his time was fully occupied with the present as a teacher and composer, to allow for the deeper and more solid work, which would in all probability have followed, had his life been spared to more mature years. To Ellis and all English players, the higher branches of the mandolinistic art were unknown, and the majority of guitarists were satisfied with the limitations of an accompaniment; but since his advent, mandolin and guitar instruction books and music have been published in profusion in this country, but his works maintain their popularity.\""

  "text" : "Harold Peiris (1904–1988) was a Sri Lankan artist, lawyer, author, scholar, teacher and translator. He was the co-founder of the Lionel Wendt Art Centre and its sole life-trustee. He also established the Sapumal Foundation. Born to a celebrated wealthy aristocratic family, he was the only son of Charles Peiris, the younger brother of the more famous Sir James Peiris and Maude de Mel, who was a sister of Sir Henry De Mel. He is a great grandson of Sir Charles Henry de Soysa. Educated at Royal College, Colombo and St. John's College, Cambridge, Harold graduated with a degree in law and became a Barrister at Lincoln's Inn. In 1923, he joined the Royal Academy of London and obtained a Diploma in Art, where Sir William Rothenstein was one of his teachers. In 1926 he won the prize for the best portrait, one of his uncle, Sir James Pieris. Thereafter he spent six years in Paris where he befriended Henri Matisse and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Peiris became a teacher at Rabindranath Tagore's Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan before returning to Ceylon in 1935. Pieris, Lionel Wendt, George Keyt, Ivan Peries, Justin Daraniyagala, Aubrey Collette, Richard Gabriel, Geoffrey Beling, George Claessen and L T P Manjusri Thero were original members of the Colombo '43 Group that laid the foundation of modern art in Sri Lanka. Lester James Peries became a latter associate of the group. Peiris was one of the co-founders of the Lionel Wendt Art Centre that was opened in 1953 in memory of artist Lionel Wendt. The second gallery of the center is named Harold Peiris Gallery in his honor. Fluent in several languages, including Pali, Sanskrit and Latin, he translated to Sinhalese the Gita Govinda in collaboration with George Keyt in 1940 and in collaboration with L.C. Van Geyzel, translated most of the poems and plays of Kālidāsa in 1961. Harold Peiris married first in 1928 to Leah, daughter of S.W. Dassenaike, a retired Public Works Department engineer and a member of the Legislative Council of Ceylon and second to Alicia \"Peggy\" Keyt sister of the artist George Keyt in 1940. He also founded the Sapumal Foundation in 1974 and bequeathed his house and art collection to it. Several mansions that were once owned by his family were either gifted or acquired by prominent institutions of Colombo, including Bishop's College, Colombo, St Bridget's Convent, Colombo and the Durdans Hospital."

Joining in with the militant suffragettes, he was sent to prison multiple times, making him one of the few men to be imprisoned for his part in the suffrage movement. His crimes included an attempted attack on Winston Churchill and an act of arson on a train. He was the first person to be released under the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913 (the so-called \"Cat and Mouse law\"), and he later married the second. Following his release, he never returned to prison, but still campaigned for women's rights and penal reform. He stood unsuccessfully for parliament on two occasions, but did win a seat on Middlesex County Council and was a member of the Labour Party executive committee."

  "text" : "Helmer Molander was born in 1892, son of Jonas Molander and Anna Sofia Äsén. His father was a carpenter by profession. The household where Molander grew up was embedded into the nascent labour movement. His brother was a trade union activist. Helmer Molander began working at a saw mill as a teenager. He became active in the local Social Democratic Youth club. When the Social Democratic Party was split in 1917, Molander sided with the left-wing. After a brief experience in local politics (he served as vice chairman of the Säbrå municipal council 1920–1926), Molander was elected to Parliament and Västernorrland County Council as a candidate of the Communist Party. In 1924 he represented the Communist Party of Sweden at the Fourth World Congress of the Communist International. When the Communist Party split in 1924, Molander sided with Zeth Höglund's independent Communist Party. Molander was the sole member of the Höglund party in the Second Chamber of parliament. Soon Höglund's party would merge back into the Social Democratic Party. Between 1926 and 1941, Molander worked as ombudsman of the Social Democratic Party District of Ångermanland. As a key organizer of the party in Ångermanland, Molander's political work was characterized by sharp confrontations with the Communist Party and the Farmers' League. Following the deadly 1931 Ådalen riots, the Social Democratic Party organized an investigatory commission consisting of Molander, Ivar Vennerström and Georg Branting. In spite of his militant past, Molander appealed for calm after the killings. The day after the investigatory commission reached Kramfors, the three leaders would speak at a mass rally. The meeting was disturbed by followers of the Communist Party. Molander also represented the Social Democratic Party in parliament. As a parliamentarian, he was engaged in issues like the abolition of the bicameral system and lowering the age of suffrage. In 1928 he was included into the national party board (where he remained until 1941). He served as chairman of the Västernorrland County Council between 1938 and 1940. In 1941 he was appointed county director, thereby resigning from all political positions."

  "text" : "Harvey John Tompkins, M.D. (1906–1983) was an American physician, a psychiatrist, whose professional life was in public service. Tompkins was born in Chicago into a working-class family. His early education was at Holy Cross School and St. Cyril's College in Chicago. He received his B.S. in 1927 and then his M.D. in 1932 from Loyola University Chicago, School of Medicine. He interned at Mercy Hospital in Chicago. His residency in obstetrics and in pediatrics was completed at Lewis Memorial Maternity Hospital in Chicago and the Chicago Municipal Contagious Disease Hospital. In 1934, he entered the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant and assigned to the Civilian Conservation Corps. He served in the Army for 31 years, retiring as a Colonel. In 1935, Tompkins entered his psychiatric residency at the Veterans Administration (VA) Mental Hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas. Through the VA, he traveled to numerous VA mental hospitals: Danville, Illinois, St. Cloud, Minnesota, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Mendota, Wisconsin. In 1945, as World War II ended, the VA medical service was reorganized and a Division of Psychiatry and Neurology was established. Daniel Blain, M.D, was the director of the new division and he selected Tompkins to be his assistant. Two years later, Blain resigned and Tompkins took his place as Director of the Division of Psychiatry and Neurology. He remained the director until 1955 when he resigned from the VA to accept a position at the St. Vincent's Catholic Medical Center in New York. St. Vincent's was a long-established 600 bed general hospital and there were plans to expand the hospital to 1,000 beds and to include psychiatric services. Tompkins served as a consultant during the planning and construction and upon completion; he headed the new psychiatric service until 1973 when he retired. Under Tompkins's tenure, the psychiatric service grew from eight attending physicians and psychiatric residents to 50 attendings and 28 residents. Training programs were introduced in the areas of psychology, social work, and occupational therapy. St. Vincent’s was under the authority of the Catholic Diocese and Tompkins became the coordinator of all psychiatric Catholic sponsored health facilities in the New York area. Tompkins was a member of numerous medical and psychiatric organizations: the National Academy of Religion and Psychiatry (president, 1957–1958), the New York City Community Mental Health Board, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the National Association of Mental Health, the American College of Physicians, the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, the American Academy of Neurology, the American Psychiatric Association, (president 1966–1967), a Trustee at the New York School of Psychiatry, Associate Secretary of the World Psychiatric Association, and a corresponding member of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association. He was a professor of clinical psychiatry at Georgetown University Medical School and at the New York University School of Medicine. In 1965, he delivered the Maudsley Bequest Lecture at a joint meeting of the American Psychiatric Association and the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Harvey died in New York in 1983."

  "text" : "Sir Henry Mitchell (1824 – 27 April 1898) was a Bradford millowner. He was born in Esholt, Bradford to manufacturer Matthew Mitchell and started work at 14 years of age in his father's mill. In 1841 he joined William Fison and Co and seven years later moved to A&S Henry and Co as a buyer, becoming a partner in 1852. By that time he was a leading authority on the worsted trade and influential in Bradford politics. He was a philanthropist and governor of the Bradford School Board and Grammar School and Vice President of the Bradford’s Mechanic Institute. He was a Justice of the Peace and elected Mayor of Bradford in 1874. He founded Bradford Technical School, now part of Bradford College, which was opened by King Edward VII in 1882, who knighted him in 1887 for his services to education. In 1898, just before his death, was made the first Honorary Freeman of the City of Bradford. On his death he was buried in Undercliffe Cemetery, Bradford. He had married the daughter of a priest surnamed Gordon, of Earlston, with whom he had three sons."

He rose to be Deputy Governor and then Governor of the Bank of England in 1727, but unknown to his contemporaries, his fortune was largely fictitious and he was embezzling from the Bank and his daughters' trust fund. He died suddenly in 1731, perhaps having poisoned himself to forestall the discovery of his frauds, and left behind enormous debts."

Cohen is especially familiar with east Jerusalem, the topic of his book, Kikar Hashuk Reka (The Marketplace is Empty or: The Rise and Fall of Arab Jeruslaem), because of the years he spent as a correspondent for east Jerusalem affairs for the Israeli weekly Kol Ha'ir. He published extensively on the Palestinian internal refugees and on the 1948 war. Two of his books deal with Palestinian collaborators and the Israeli security agencies, using methodology that can be described as history-from-below. The Jerusalem Post calls his books \"an accessible mixture of academic research and vivid journalistic reporting. Cohen manages to show empathy when relating human issues, but maintains a professional distance regarding events.\" He first became known in other countries in 2008 when his book Army of Shadows, Palestinian Collaboration with Zionism, 1917-1948 was published with the University of California Press. His book Good Arabs: The Israeli Security Services and the Israeli Arabs was published with the same press. His latest book Year Zero of the Arab-Israeli Conflict was published by Brandeis University Press, 2015."

He owned lands at Church Lawton, (then known as Bog-Lawton): in 1338 one Ralph de Lawton gave a quitclaim for all lands held there by Henry and his heirs. He was appointed a senior official of the English Crown by 1346, when he appears on a commission in London to investigate the forgery of the Royal seal. In the same year he was appointed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, but seems to have spent no more than a few months in that office, since he was replaced in the same year by John de Rednesse, and he is shortly afterwards heard of as member of a Commission of Oyer and Terminer in Derbyshire. In 1357 he was made a judge of the Court of Common Pleas and in the same year he sat on another royal commission, to investigate an alleged affray between Simon Warde, a servant of John Gynwell, Bishop of Lincoln and certain members of the Order of Hospitallers, on whom Warde had been attempting to serve a summons to appear in a lawsuit. Ironically the future Prior of the Hospitallers, Richard de Wirkeley, who with the then Prior John de Paveley, allegedly instigated the affray, had also been Lord Chief Justice of Ireland: the commission included yet another Irish Chief Justice, William de Notton. Motlowe died in 1361."

His parents were married by a rabbi and never filed for a civil license due to quotas on the number of Jewish marriages in Galicia then under Austrian rule. Henryks father's name was Abraham Fuchsbrunner and Fuchsbrunner was the name that he was known by. Henryk Fuchsbrunner shortened his name to Henry Fuchs after he arrived in the United States in 1952. Fuchsbrunner was one of five children. He lived with his extended family in Chrzanów in south Poland before the outbreak of war, After several deportations, he arrived at the Kraków Ghetto. After avoiding capture by the German and Polish authorities for over 3 years, Fuchsbrunner was arrested in November 1942 and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Shortly after arriving at Auschwitz, he was selected for work in the Sonderkommando at the crematoria of the camp, where his specialised job of stoking the ovens with corpses probably ensured his survival."

  "text" : "Hans Gaas ( c.1500 – 17 September 1578) was a Norwegian clergyman. He was Bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros in the aftermath of the introduction of Lutheranism into Norway. Gaas was born in Svendborg on the island of Funen in Denmark. He studied in Wittenberg for a few years from 1521. He took his magister degree in theology at Copenhagen during 1548. He was sent to Trondheim in 1549 with the goal of completing the Reformation of the church in the Diocese of Nidaros. When he first came to Trondheim, he was initially assigned to the Cloister at Elgeseter where he initiated reform. He also undertook a rescue mission for Nidaros Cathedral which was badly damaged by fires in 1327 and again in 1531. In his efforts to initiate reform of the church, he found an ally in Gjeble Pederssøn (ca. 1490-1557) Bishop in Bergen stift, who in 1536 had become the first Lutheran Bishop within Norway. Pederssøn was likewise reforming the church in Bergen. Hans Gaas served as superintendent and Bishop in Trondhjems stift from 1549 until his death in 1578, except for the war period from 1564 to 1570. In 1563, the Northern Seven Years' War was initiated between Sweden and Denmark. In 1564, Swedish forces occupied Trøndelag, including the city of Trondheim. Gaas refused taking the oath to the king of Sweden and was imprisoned. The war ended in 1570 with the withdrawal of Swedish forces under terms of the Treaty of Stettin at which time Gaas was reinstated in his former office."

Lahmann was born in 1816 in Bremen, Germany, where he received his education. He went to London as a young man for business. He emigrated to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in 1853, where he worked as a merchant and shipping agent for eight years. He came to Otago in New Zealand when gold was discovered and had a tobacco store in Dunedin. The West Coast Gold Rush brought him to Greymouth in late 1865, where he had business interests in shipping, timber, and as a general merchant. Lahmann was one of the founding members of the Greymouth town improvement committee. He succeeded William Henry Harrison as the representative of the Greymouth riding on the Westland County, the predecessor of Westland Province; he represented Greymouth from December 1868 until December 1872. He was the fourth chairman of Westland County, from 12 January 1871 to 8 January 1873. When the Westland Province was inaugurated, Lahmann successfully stood for election in January 1874 for one of the three seats in the Greymouth electorate. He remained a member of the provincial council until the abolition of the council in October 1876. After John White resigned as Speaker of the Provincial Council to join its Executive, Lahmann became the council's second and last Speaker (8 June 1874 – 31 October 1876). He was a member of the Legislative Council from 9 July 1872 until his death. Lahmann died on to 1 June 1890 at his residence in Albert Street, Greymouth. He had been in poor health for several years and had been almost blind during that time. His wife had died many years before him."

He was one of the founders of Wellington, arriving in 1840 on the Oriental. The Petre family was one of the first and most prominent colonial families of New Zealand; giving their name to Petre Bay, Chatham Island, and originally the town of Wanganui, north of Wellington. Petre returned to England to find a wife. His father sent for Mary Ann Eleanor Walmsley, then 15 years old and brought up in a convent, and the wedding happened in 1842. Petre lived in the Hutt Valley, and with Vavasour and Charles Clifford established a sheep station in the Wairarapa. Governor Sir George Grey appointed Petre to be Postmaster-General on 13 August 1853, but his appointment was not accepted by the First Parliament that met in 1854, and he left for England early in the new year. He returned with his family to England in 1854. His first wife died in 1885, and he remarried to the widow Sara Tolme. He died in Essex in 1889. He seems to have been a man of strange appearance, from the description by his contemporary, the New Zealand social commentator Charlotte Godley: \"He is immensely tall and thin and looks like a set of fire irons badly hung together\". His father William Petre, 11th Baron Petre, was chairman of the New Zealand Company. The Petres were an aristocratic family from Ingatestone in Essex, England, and the Wellington suburb of Thorndon was named after their Thorndon Hall estate in England. The family were recusant Roman Catholics. The architect Francis Petre was his son."

Coote was appointed Brigade-Major to the 65th Regiment of Foot in Wellington New Zealand in 1852. On half pay from 1 July 1853 he returned to England in 1858 soon after his promotion to Major. There he lobbied the War Office to put a force together under his command to fight in the New Zealand Wars but was unsuccessful. He retired from the army and returned to New Zealand arriving in December 1861. He took up the Carleton run near Oxford, Canterbury and won prizes for his merinos. He left Canterbury and settled in 1864 first at Opaki north of Masterton then as he had originally intended about four miles west of Masterton on Matahiwi Station which he had purchased in 1861. It was later described in an (unsuccessful) 1896 petition for compulsory purchase under Seddon's Lands for Settlement Act as six or seven thousand acres of good land, some first-class some second. An accomplished artist in watercolours he was a regular exhibitor. His portraits of Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata were engraved and published in Sydney. Major Coote married Rhoda Carleton Holmes, daughter of William Holmes of Worthing, Sussex at Lyminster on 22 October 1844. There were no surviving children of the marriage. He died after a long illness aged 48 on 25 March 1867 and she died in England in December 1898. Their property went to his wife's family. The main homestead is now a residence of Sir Peter Jackson."

  "text" : "John Henry Okullu (1929, Ramba Village, Asembo Central Location, Siaya District, Nyanza Province – 1999) was a Kenyan Anglican bishop and theologian. Okullu was a Bishop in the Anglican Church of Kenya known for his outspoken criticism of the Kenyan government. He married Esther Benta Nyambok in 1951 and they had 6 children. He was ordained an Anglican deacon in 1957, then as a priest in 1958. Okullu studied at Virginia Theological Seminary from 1963 to 1965, earning a Bachelor of Divinity degree. From 1962 to 1971, he was the editor of a Christian Newspaper in Uganda called New Day. He was consecrated as the first black provost of the Nairobi All Saints Cathedral in 1971 and Bishop of Maseno South Diocese where he served until his retirement in 1994. Okullu was known for his political engagement. His first book was \"Church and Politics in East Africa\", published in 1974, which was an early call for pluralistic democracy. In this book he wrote, \"The best system of government is one that is based on the principle of the constant exchange of ideas between the rulers and the ruled: a system which provides everyone with an opportunity to make his or her political contribution to the best of his ability and knowledge.\" Okullu became an outspoken critic of President Daniel arap Moi, criticizing the government over the murder of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko and calling for the introduction of pluralistic politics and fair elections. Despite their public disagreements, Okullu met with President Moi a number of times to provide guidance on issues such as how to respond to election violence in 1992. He published four books, including an autobiography."

In 1937, Helen Keller came to Japan and visited Hokkiichi's memorial house. She expressed her impression as follows: \"When I was a child, my mother told me that Mr.Hanawa was your role model. To visit this place and touch his statue was the significant event during this trip to Japan. The worn desk and the statue facing down earned more respect of him. I believe that his name would pass down from generation to generation like a stream of water."

  "text" : "Herman Joseph Lombaert (1816-1885) was an American civil engineer who helped complete the first railroad between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Baltimore, Maryland, and eventually became a vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). Lombaert was born on Oct. 30, 1816, in Easton, Pennsylvania, the son of Charles (1790-1875) and Anna Arndt Lombaert (1794-1879). In the 1830s, Charles was a company officer or contractor for several railroads, including the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad (P&T). After Herman Lombaert completed his civil engineering studies, he took a job with the P&T under engineer Samuel H. Kneass (1806-1858), with whom he helped build the main line. In 1836, Kneass and Lombaert helped survey the prospective route of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad (PW&B)from the Delaware state line to its initial Philadelphia terminus at the intersection of Broad Street and Moyamensing Avenue. Lombaert was the target bearer, while Kneass' younger brother Strickland Kneass was the chain carrier. The line would be the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore (and survives today as part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor). In 1838, Charles Lombaert was one of three superintendents of construction for the PW&B. Herman, the son, had moved up from his job on the surveying team to the post of assistant engineer, under Samuel Kneass, for the Philadelphia-Wilmington stretch. And in the meantime, Kneass had become not just Herman's boss but his brother-in-law: on March 14, 1837, Kneass married Herman's sister Anna (1814-1869) in Morrisville, Pennsylvania, Herman Lombaert's work on the PW&B was noted (along with that of his father and brother-in-law) on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument in Philadelphia. On May 2, 1844, he married Sarah Cochran (1820-1890) in Chester, Pennsylvania. That same year, he traveled to Colombia to lay out a route for a canal to connect the city of Cartagena with the Magdalena River. In 1851, Herman Lombaert became assistant superintendent of the PRR, under Herman Haupt. The following year, he became the railroad's superintendent. In 1853, a young Andrew Carnegie was working for Thomas A. Scott, then the superintendent of the PRR's Pittsburgh division (and later PRR president). Lombaert, who was Scott's boss, invited the 18-year-old Carnegie for tea. In his autobiography, Carnegie described Lombaert as \"the great man in our railroad field...not sociable, but stern and unbending.\" (He found Sarah Lombaert \"exceedingly kind.\") In 1862, Lombaert became a vice president of the PRR. In 1871, he became president of the American Steamship Company of Philadelphia, a shipping company launched with PRR investment, and the following year resigned from the railroad. Herman Lombaert died On March 10, 1885, in Philadelphia."

Lange along with two Catholic priest colleagues – Johannes Prassek and Eduard Müller – along with Lutheran Pastor Karl Friedrich Stellbrink, spoke publicly against the Nazis – initially discreetly – distributing pamphlets to friends and congregants. They copied and distributed the anti-Nazi sermons of Bishop August von Galen of Munster. Then, following a March 28, 1942 RAF airraid, after which Stellbrink tended wounded, he delivered a Palm Sunday sermon which attributed the bombing to divine punishment. Stellbrink was arrested, followed by the three Catholic priests, and each were sentenced to death. The mingling of the blood of the four guillotined martyrs has become a symbol of German Ecumenism."

  "text" : "Holmes Moss Alexander (January 29, 1906 - December 5, 1985) was an American historian, journalist, syndicated columnist, and politician, originally from Parkersburg, West Virginia. From 1931 to 1935, Alexander was a member of the all-Democratic delegation from Baltimore County to the Maryland House of Delegates. Typical of Alexander's newspaper columns was one that he wrote on Democratic Governor George Wallace of Alabama, who when term-limited in 1966 ran his wife, Lurleen Burns Wallace, as a surrogate gubernatorial candidate, against Republican U.S. Representative James D. Martin. Known for his opposition to school desegregation, Wallace procured passage of a series of state laws promptly struck down by federal courts, who required the implementation of Brown v. Board of Education. Alexander writes: \"Though Wallace has lost every fight with Washington, Alabamians are convinced he has come off the winner.\" Alexander's books include The American Talleyrand: Martin Van Buren (1935), Aaron Burr: The Proud Pretender (1937), American Nabob (1939), and Selena: A Romantic Novel (1941). Other Alexander works include Pen and Politics: The Autobiography of a Working Writer, How to Read The Federalist, To Covet Honor: A Biography of Alexander Hamilton, The Spirit of '76, Washington and Lee: A Study in Will to Win, Seattle: Growth of the City, Tokyo: Growth of the City, Hong Kong: Growth of the City, Beijing: Growth of the City, Shanghai: Growth of the City, and Vancouver, British Columbia: The Growth of the City/State. His last publication, Never Lose a War: Memoirs and Observations of a National Columnist, was released in 1984, the year before his death. His maternal uncle, Hunter Holmes Moss, Jr., was a circuit judge and then a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from West Virginia from 1913 until his death in 1916. Alexander was married to the former Mary Morgan Barksdale. He resided in Owings Mills in Baltimore County, Maryland, where he is interred at Saint Thomas Episcopal Church Cemetery."

  "text" : "Henry 'Hank' Syverson (5 October 1918 in Pine Bush, New York – 12 August 2007 in Pine Bush, New York) was an American cartoonist and illustrator, who contributed cartoons regularly to The Saturday Evening Post, This Week and many other periodicals. In World War II PFC Hank Syverson served with the US Army on Okinawa. Syverson attended the Walt Disney Animation Studios in the company of many animators destined for fame in magazine cartooning - there were Sam Cobean and Eldon Dedini. Some graduated to syndicated fame, such as Walt Kelly (Pogo), Hank Ketcham (Dennis the Menace) and George Baker (Sad Sack). One of my favorite influences is Henry Syverson. When I first saw his cartoons as a small boy in The Saturday Evening Post magazine, I had no idea he had once been a Disney artist, but when I learned that years later I wasn't surprised. His characters have the appeal and fluidity I associate with Disney, somehow coupled with a slightly more Thurber-esque abstraction. Like Walt Kelly, Hank Ketchum and other Disney alumni though, Syverson carved out a personal niche that is as unmistakeable as a signature.— Will Finn (animator)For thirty years I have pursued my favorite hobby -- at Walt Disney's Studios, then as a soldier-cartoonist (PFC Hank Syverson), and today, with my wife and two children contributing much inspiration, as a free-lance cartoonist. But perhaps to consider cartooning a hobby is deceiving. My son once asked me, 'Daddy, are you unemployed?'— Henry Syverson"

  "text" : "Hugh Duncan Baillie (31 May 1777 – 21 June 1866) was a British army officer, MP and Lord Lieutenant of Ross-shire. He was the second son of Evan Baillie of Dochfour, a prosperous Bristol merchant, and the brother of Peter Baillie and James Evan Baillie. He succeeded his father in 1835. He joined the Army as an ensign in the 37th Foot in 1793. He was promoted to lieutenant in the 93rd Foot the same year, to captain in the 97th Foot and then major in the 86th Foot in 1794 and to lieutenant-colonel in 1800. He took part in the occupation of the Cape of Good Hope between 1796 and 1803 during the Napoleonic Wars. He went on to half pay with the Surrey Rangers from 1802 to 1825 and was finally made a colonel of the army in 1810. He retired from the army in 1825. In 1812 he and his brother James became partners in the Bristol Old Bank. Hugh had become senior partner by his death. He entered Parliament as the MP for Rye in 1830 and was then returned for Honiton in 1835, sitting until 1847. He served as Lord lieutenant of Ross-shire from 1843 until his death. During the Parliament of 1835 he received a share of a compensation award totalling over £60,000 for the freed slaves on some 17 estates in Guyana, Grenada, St Kitts, St Vincent and Trinidad which he either owned or in which he had an interest (see the database \"Legacies of British Slavery\" run by University College London). He bought the Ross-shire estate of Redcastle from the Trustees of Sir William Fettes after the latter's death in 1836. He died in 1866. He had married twice:firstly, at the Cape of Good Hope, Elizabeth, the daughter of Rev. Henry Reynett of Goodmans Fields, London, with whom he had a son and 3 daughters and secondly Mary, the daughter of Thomas Smith of Castleton Hall, Lancashire, with whom he had 3 sons and a daughter. His personal estate after his death was valued at under £50,000."

  "text" : "Radford Henry (Harry) Dagnall MA, AKC, FRPSL, (23 October 1914 - 9 March 2012) was a British philatelist and Fellow of The Royal Philatelic Society London who made a lifetime's study of some of the by-ways of philately with a special interest in revenue philately. He was educated at The King's School, Canterbury and King's College London. Dagnall's heyday as a philatelic writer was in the 1970s and 80's and his work was mostly in the form of pamphlets and short monographs on diverse subjects which caught his attention. His history of the British government Stamp Office, however, Creating a Good Impression, was a longer work published by H.M. Stationery Office in 1994 to coincide with their 300th anniversary. In 1991, Dagnall's sight began to seriously fail and he gave up active philately at that time, though he continued to write as much as he could. A bibliography of his work was prepared during his lifetime by Ian D. Crane for private circulation and a bound copy was placed in the library of the Royal Philatelic Society. Outside philately, Dagnall was a technical writer in the patent department of the British Tabulating Machine Company which became ICT and ICL. He made frequent contributions to The Communicator, the journal of the Institute of Scientific and Technical Communications and also wrote on architecture, Biblical history and xerographic printing. He was a regular contributor to The Quarterly, the journal of The British Association of Paper Historians, with whom one his works was jointly published in 1998 and he also contributed to journals as diverse as The Thai Times and The Wallpaper History Review."

  "text" : "Major Hiram Mills (c. 1796–1882) was an American-born philanthropist. Originally from Virginia, Mills moved to Montreal at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Mills inherited a substantial sum from his father, who had been a plantation owner, but generally declined to discuss his previous career and asked that no obituary be published for him. Mills was a generous, but eccentric, philanthropist. The Irish Canadian newspaper reported that he had been a board member of every Protestant charity in Montreal, and in 1879 he helped finance the establishment of a new hospital in the western end of the city. At one point, Mills offered $20,000 to the city to purchase bread for the poor, but attached so many conditions to the bequest that it was refused. Mills joined a Southern Masonic Lodge in 1819 and, upon his death in 1882, it was reported that he had been amongst the oldest, if not the oldest, Freemason in Canada. Mills bequeathed $43,000 to McGill College (now McGill University) to establish a gold medal, a scholarship, and an endowed chair in classics. Mills left a further $30,000 to the Western Hospital and $20,000 to the Anglican church, but left no provision for his widow. McGill College and the Anglican synod established a pension of $450 per annum for Mrs. Mills. Mills is interred in a mausoleum at Mount Royal Cemetery."

Trained as a stage actor at the Bungaku-za after graduating from Chuo University, he first began to appear on Japanese TV in small roles in 2008, and then in films in 2011. His most recent film performance can be seen in Sion Sono’s Why Don’t You Play in Hell? as the young, passionate, and slightly deranged film-director wannabe, Don Hirata.

  "text" : "Hilda Yank Sing Yen (Chinese: 顏雅清; pinyin: Yán Yǎqīng) or sometimes Yan, was one of the leading figures of Chinese American society for some decades. Coming from a high-profile family traditionally serving Chinese governments and society, she left the East while continuing to be a bridge of cultures. Initially proving herself in university, she worked in diplomatic circles leading to the League of Nations for some years and then, inspired by aviator Li Xiaqing, she embarked on extended flights across the United States, speaking on international peace, pointing to the needs of China against the looming aggressions of the era, and then working with the United Nations. A major transition was her conversion to the Bahá'í Faith in 1944 and she was centrally involved in the religion achieving its registration as a non-governmental organization with the United Nations, where she then continued her work for several years. Ultimately she was disappointed in the international community's lack of embrace of a spiritual-religious commitment as the basis of an international peace and withdrew from such concerns. Along the way, she married twice, with two children from the first marriage though she died divorced."

As the navigator aboard a B-17 Flying Fortress during World War II, Macpherson flew 50 combat missions and was the recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Bronze Star Medal for his service, leaving the United States Army Air Corps in 1945 with the rank of Major. Following the war Macpherson took over the family dairy farm and became involved with the politics of land use planning over concerns with encroaching urban development of farmland. Macpherson was the son of former Oregon state representative Hector Macpherson, Sr. and the father of former Oregon state representative Greg Macpherson."

In 1913 he began teaching at schools in Adjara and published in the local press, championing the pro-Georgian orientation among the Muslim Adjarains. He further sympathized with the social-democratic revolutionaries and was persecuted by the Russian government. Between 1918 and 1920, together with Mehmed Abashidze, he was a driving force behind the Liberation Committee of Muslim Georgia, an organization that was active during the Turkish and then British occupation of Batum, advocating incorporation of the region into a newly independent Georgia. After the Soviet takeover of Georgia, he withdrew from politics and died in Tbilisi in 1966. He was buried at the Didube Pantheon of Writers and Public Figures in Tbilisi. Several authors, dealing with the World War I-era Caucasian affairs, confuse Haidar Abashidze with Prince Kita Abashidze, a Georgian Social Federalist and member of the Ozakom."

  "text" : "Harrison Carroll (23 June 1901 – 1972) was a Hollywood gossip columnist who worked at the Los Angeles Herald-Express with whom John Wayne credited with not only being a mentor to him but helping him come up with a moniker to replace his birth name Marion Morrison. He was born in Waco, Texas at the turn of the century. After graduating from Waco High School, Carroll attended the Rice Institute before moving on to Columbia University, where he took his bachelor of arts degree in 1922. That same year, he moved to Los Angeles, California and began working as a reporter for the Los Angeles Times for $25 a week. In 1925, he was hired as the drama editor of the Los Angeles Evening Herald (an afternoon newspaper that was a precursor to the Herald-Examiner and the merged Herald-Express that continued to employ him until he retired). The following year, he created his gossip column. He eventually had a feature called \"Today's Puzzle\" that gave clues to a star, never mentioning them by name. He tried not to hurt any of the stars he covered, which made him popular with the denizens of Hollywood. He covered the film industry for 43 years, writing his last column in 1969, after which he retired. His column was syndicated by the Central Press Association to 48 newspapers. He had feuds with the leading gossip columnists of the day, including Hedda Hopper, Louella Parsons and his fellow Herald columnist Jimmy Starr: all of them appeared as themselves in the 1947 crime movie The Corpse Came C.O.D.. Beginning in 1967 until he retired, Carroll's main place of business was the private, members-only Beverly Hills discotheque-cum-restaurant Daisy, a hang-out for the younger, hipper stars like Paul Newman when he was in L.A. He created the Harrison Carroll Cinema Reporting Prize in 1971, the same year before he died. John Wayne was the chairman of the foundation that awarded the prize. In addition to Wayne, Carroll was close to Clara Bow and Clark Gable. Reportedly, 1,000 subscribers cancelled their subscriptions to the Herald after he retired. He was married twice, to Corrinne Carroll, by whom he had a son, and whom he divorced, and to Maria Carroll, whom he lived with for 47 years. Army Archerd, who would establish himself as a famous entertainment industry gossip columnist, worked as a \"leg man\" for Carroll."

  "text" : "\"Professor\" Henry Lewis (1819–1904) was a self-taught American artist and showman, best known for his paintings of the American West. Born in England, his family emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts when he was ten, where he was apprenticed to a carpenter. At age seventeen, he moved to St. Louis, Missouri where he worked as a carpenter and scenery painter at the St. Louis Theatre. Between 1846 and 1848, he sketched and painted hundreds of scenes of the Mississippi River. These included rare views, such as the Morman Temple at Nauvoo, Illinois (burned 1848); and the great St. Louis Fire of 1849. He developed his sketches into a giant moving panorama – 12 feet by 1,300 feet – which was unrolled, with music and narration, before theater audiences in the United States and Europe. He settled in Germany in 1854, and published a book with eighty illustrations based on his panorama: The Illustrated Mississippi: From the Falls of St. Anthony to the Gulf of Mexico (1857). He died in Dusseldorf, Germany."

  "text" : "Harold Harper Bennett (1900–1999) was an American business leader and singer. He is a member of the notable Bennett family. Bennett was born on September 20, 1900, in Salt Lake City, Utah to John Foster Bennett and Rosetta Elizabeth (née Wallace) Bennett. He is the brother of former U.S. Senator Wallace F. Bennett and the uncle of another former U.S. Senator, Bob Bennett. He attended Lowell School and later LDS High School. During his high school days he was buried alive in a landslide escaping only with a broken nose. The nose would remain crooked throughout his life and would be his trademark. Bennett studied first at the University of Utah where he was the editor of both The Pen and the Utah Chronicle. It was here that he met his wife Emily Higgs Bennett who would later serve in the presidency of the LDS Young Women organization. Together they would raise 8 children. He graduated from the Business School with a B.A. in Commerce and Finance in 1925. He later studied Economics and Political Science at the University of London. During his distinguished career, Bennett became the first President of the ZCMI Department Store that was not also president of the LDS church. He would later serve as President of the National Retail Merchants Association. He also served as trustee of the National Committee for Economic Development. He would also serve on the board of directors for Zions Bank, Deseret Book, and LDS Hospital. While in England, Bennett studied music with F.C. Field-Hyde who encouraged him (in vain) to pursue a career in music. He however would go on to sing with the Salt Lake Oratorio Society, with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, with the Utah Symphony, among others. Racquet sports were among his many other talents. He held state championship titles in tennis, badminton, and squash. Bennett died at his home on December 1, 1999, less than a year short of his 100th birthday."

  "text" : "Hamoud Abdallah Said Al-Dalhami (Arabic: حمود عبد الله سيد الدلهمي‎‎; born November 7, 1971 in Muscat) is a retired Omani sprinter, who specialized in both 100 and 200 metres. He represented Oman in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), and also attained personal bests of 10.44 (100 metres) and 20.94 (200 metres) from the 1999 Pan Arab Championships in Beirut, Lebanon. Al-Dalhami made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed as a member of the Omani track and field team in the men's 4×100 m relay. Running the second leg in heat four, Al-Dalhami delivered the Omani foursome a seasonal best and a sixth-place time in 39.82, but finished twenty-eighth overall from the prelims. At the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, Al-Dalhami finished eighth in the 200 metres with a time of 21.25, trailing behind Japan's Shingo Suetsugu by almost a full second. Four years after competing in his last Olympics, Al-Dalhami qualified for his second Omani team in the men's 200 metres at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens by receiving a wild card invitation from IAAF without an entry time. Running against seven other athletes in heat four, Al-Dalhami surpassed Japan's Ryo Matsuda to take the seventh spot by a full three-second gap in 21.82. Al-Dalhami failed to advance into the semifinals as he placed farther from two automatic slots for the next round and shared a forty-ninth overall position with Swaziland's Mphelave Dlamini from the prelims. Al-Dalhami was also appointed by the Oman Olympic Committee to carry the nation's flag in the opening ceremony."

  "text" : "Hans Vilhelm Adolf Juhl, nicknamed Gestapo-Juhl (born 1903/1904, date of death unknown), was a German SS-officer. Juhl was an SS-Hauptscharführer (First Sergeant), kriminal oberassistent, and leader of the local Gestapo in the area around Helsingør (Elsinore) in Denmark from late summer 1943. He was born and raised in Schleswig-Holstein and spoke and understood Danish fairly well. He worked as a farmer outside of Flensburg before World War II and joined the Nazi party and SS shortly before the Nazi takeover of power in 1933. He arrived in Denmark shortly after the German occupation of Denmark in 1940. In Helsingør Juhl and the local Gestapo moved into villa Wisborg, which became the center of activity of the local Gestapo. The basement was used for interrogation and as jail. Juhl participated in the round-up of the Danish Jews in October 1943 and he was very actively involved in the capture of Danish Jews, who were trying to escape to Sweden. Gestapo Juhl was responsible for arresting about half of the 481 Danish Jews, who were deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, including the razzia on the attic in Gilleleje Church on the night between the 6th and the 7th October 1943, where 85 people were arrested. Juhl was not convicted for his crimes after the war."

  "text" : "Hulda Jane Stumpf (10 January 1867 – 3 January 1930) was an American Christian missionary who was murdered in her home near the Africa Inland Mission station in Kijabe, Kenya, where she worked as a secretary and administrator. Stumpf may have been killed because of the mission's opposition to female genital mutilation (FGM, also known as female circumcision). Kenya's main ethnic group, the Kikuyu, regarded FGM as an important rite of passage, and there had been protests against the missionary churches in Kenya because they opposed it. The period is known within Kenyan historiography as the female circumcision controversy. Stumpf is reported to have taken a firm stand against FGM in the Kijabe Girls' Home, which she helped to run. Some apparently unusual injuries on her body suggested to the governor of Kenya at the time that, before or after smothering her, her killer(s) had genitally mutilated her, although a court concluded that there was no evidence she had been killed because of her opposition to FGM."

She was born in Montesano, Washington but moved to Corvallis, Oregon with her family in 1903 where she attended Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University). Gilkey received both a bachelor's and a master's degree for her studies in botany (including mycology) and botanical illustration. She continued her studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and in 1915 she became the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in botany there. Gilkey's doctoral dissertation focused on the taxonomy of North American truffles (order Tuberales) and her published dissertation remains an important contribution to the study of truffle taxonomy in North America. After completing her doctoral studies, Gilkey secured a position as the herbarium curator at the Oregon Agricultural College in 1918. Gilkey also conducted research on vascular plants, but she was best known for her extensive studies on truffles. Gilkey described many species of truffles from the United States as well as a few from Argentina and Australia. Her 1939 monograph is the most comprehensive work on Tuberales of North America. In 2006, the truffle genus Gilkeya was named in Gilkey's honor. The standard author abbreviation Gilkey is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "(for others called Harry Watson, see disambiguation page Harry Watson) Harry B. Watson, Jr. (June 12, 1876 – October 1, 1965) was an American actor and comedian. Before his Vaudeville and Broadway stage career and making his films, he was a clown for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Among his Broadway shows were the George Gershwin musical Tip-Toes and five editions of the Ziegfeld Follies. The most high profile of his few feature films was the Marion Davies vehicle Zander the Great,but he is perhaps best recalled as the star of a series of bizarre silent comedy shorts, The Mishaps of Musty Suffer. Two volumes of surviving Musty Suffer titles were restored by the American Library of Congress and released with music by Ben Model on DVD by Undercrank Productions in 2014 and 2015. That Mr. Harry Watson, Jr., is one of the finest comic artists of the American stage is demonstrated anew with each successive year. An alumnus of the same burlesque troupe that graduated that other excellent comedian, Mr. George Bickel, Watson's authentic talents, like those of his colleague, have long been overlooked — or if not entirely overlooked, greatly disparaged — by annalists of the stage who vouchsafe to low comedy merely a casual and then grudged attention. Yet the fact doubtless remains that this Watson is an actor of uncommon quality, not a mere slapstick pantaloon, an assaulter of trousers' seats, a professor of the bladder, but a mimic of exceptional capacity, a pantomimist of the very first grade and a comedian of real histrionic parts..— George Jean Nathan, Comedians All"

  "text" : "Hermann Friese (Hamburg, 30 Mai 1882 or 22 Mai 1880 - São Paulo October 1945) was a German-Brazilian athlete, association football player and referee. He is considered alongside Charles Miller, Hans Nobiling and Oscar Cox one of the most important pioneers of football in Brazil and is recognized as the first exceptional footballer there. In 1903 aged 21, he migrated from Germany to Brazil where he joined Sport Club Germânia, the club of the German community of São Paulo, founded in 1899 by Hans Nobiling. Like Nobiling Friese played in Hamburg for SC Germania 1887 - one of the precursors of today's Hamburger SV - which gave name and colours to the Brazilian club. Friese was top scorer of the State Championship of São Paulo, the Campeonato Paulista of 1905 with 14 goals and won the championship mit Germânia in 1906 and 1915. In 1903 the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo called him \"the most sensational player of all time\" (o jogador mais sensacional de todos os tempos). Friese was also coach of the team where around 1909 Arthur Friedenreich obtained his first experiences. \"Fried,\" these days considered of one of the greatest players of all time, was son of a German businessman that migrated from Hamburg and a black Brazilian woman. By intervention of Friese, statutes of the club prohibiting the membership of coloured people were removed. Friese also was a football referee - then not uncommon for a player - and officiated the deciding matches of the State Championships of 1903, 1904, 1910 and 1920. He also was referee of the Troféu Interestadual of 1910, where Botafogo FC of Rio de Janeiro defeated AA das Palmeiras with 7-2 in the Velódromo of São Paulo. On 22 October 1916 he officiated the State Championship between Santos FC and CA Ypiranga, which also was the opening match for the stadium of Santos, the Vila Belmiro. Santos won the match 2-1. Altogether Friese arbitrated 53 or more State Championship matches. These days Friese is one of ten patrons of the Academia Paulista de Árbitros de Futebol \"Charles Miller,\" an honour he shares with World Cup referees like José Roberto Wright, Armando Marques, Arnaldo Cézar Coelho and Romualdo Arppi Filho, amongst others. Still in Europe he was a formidable track and field athlete, winning the German championship over 1500 metres of 1902. In May 1907 he was the sole representative of Brazil in an international competition in Uruguay and in one evening won the 1500 and 800 metre competitions and finishing second over 400 metres."

Disappointed that he had not been made Grand Vizier and his rival Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha had been appointed in his place, he declared himself the Sultan of Egypt, independent from the Ottoman Empire. He struck coins with his own face and name in order to legitimize his power and captured Cairo Citadel and the local Ottoman garrisons in January 1524. However, after surviving an assassination attempt in his bath by two emirs that he had previously sacked, he fled Cairo and was finally captured and executed by Ottoman authorities by decapitation. His rebellion created a short period of instability in the nascent Egypt Eyalet. After his death, his rival Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha came down to Egypt and reformed the provincial military and civil administration. Ahmed Pasha was of Georgian origin. He was educated in the Enderun palace school. The epithet \"Hain\" means \"traitor\" in Turkish."

In 1962 he formed a partnership with licensed architect Robert Ricciardi so that he could get the commission for Palm Springs Fire Station #3. After that partnership broke up, in 1965 he formed a company with Larry Lapham, noted architect Howard Lapham's son which was to last ten years. His last partnership was with James Cioffi, after which he semi-retired in 1992. Kaptur designed several notable residences, including those for Steve McQueen  and William Holden; municipal buildings – Fire Station #3 and #4 in Palm Springs; apartment buildings – the Caballeros complex; and numerous commercial hotels and office buildings. Kaptur had a Golden Palm Star dedicated to him on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars on February 14, 2014.

He was the son of a house painter and had to help his father at a young age with painting ornaments on ceilings. Soon he began to paint on canvas. Goovaerts decided to become a painter and against the wishes of his father he attended the Academy of Mechelen in Belgium. There he studied from 1883 to 1885 and was taught by among others, academy director Willem Geerts. From 1887 to 1889 he studied at the Academy in Amsterdam and took off during this study to compete for the Prix de Rome, which he won in 1890. He studied in Amsterdam with his friend and fellow student Alphonse Olterdissen; they returned to Maastricht where they opened a small private art school. After his study Henri Goovaerts returned to Maastricht where he founded a studio. He focused mainly on painting portraits, although he occasionally got other jobs as well. Henri Goovaerts died at the age of 46 on August 23, 1912. Most of the work of Henri Goovaerts is held by individuals all over the world and a few museums, amongst others the Bonnefantenmuseum in Maastricht. A park in Maastricht bears his name."

  "text" : "Hans Andrias Djurhuus (20 October 1883 – 6 May 1951) was a Faroese poet and teacher. He is well known for his national poems and for his children's songs, but he also wrote psalms, short stories, plays, fairytales and one novel. He also edited the newspaper Dúgvan from 1909 to 1910. Djurhuus was born and died in Tórshavn. His brother Janus Djurhuus, who was two years older, is also one of the well-known poets of the Faroe Islands. Both were born and raised in a house in the old part of Tórshavn, which is called Áarstova, down in the Eastern Harbour; the brothers are often referred to as the Áarstovu Brothers (Áarstovubrøðurnir). Hans Andrias Djurhuus was one of the most productive Faroese poets. The brother's great grandfather was Jens Christian Djurhuus (1773–1853), who was the first to write poems in the Faroese language. After finishing school Hans Andreas worked as a fisherman for a short period, then attended the Føroya Fólkaháskúli. He then studied at the Teachers Seminar (Føroya Læraraskúli), graduating in 1905. He worked as a school teacher in Sandavágur, Klaksvík, Tvøroyri and Tórshavn."

He restructured and developed the Foundation into a significant funder of innovative education, job training, recreation and the arts programs with assets of over 300 million dollars.

The book is divided into two parts, which were published together. The first part was dedicated to Thomas Wentworth, 2nd Baron Wentworth, with a date of 18 November 1561. It contains Philip Melanchthon's life of Martin Luther; Luther's declaration of his doctrine before the Emperor Charles V at Worms; and the oration of Melanchthon at Wittenberg, given in place of his usual exposition of the Epistle to the Romans, after the news of Luther's death. Some of this part was adapted for Actes and Monuments (1563) by John Foxe. The second part has a similar dedication to James Blount, 6th Baron Mountjoy, dated 30 November 1561. It consists of: \n*  a life of John Œcolampadius by Wolfangus Faber Capito; \n*  an account of the death of Œcolampadius by Simon Grineus; and  \n*  a life of Hulderick Zuinglius by Oswald Miconius The last two are in the form of letters. The translations are in idiomatic English, and the quotations of Œcolampadius from Homer and Euripides are turned into English verse. The authors in the second part had first been brought together by Theodore Bibliander."

He was the son-in-law of grand vizier Hekimoğlu Ali Pasha, who also served as his predecessor as governor of Egypt.

  "text" : "Henry Davy (1793–1865) was an English landscape painter, engraver and lithographer active in East Anglia. Davy was born on 30 May 1793 in The Poplars, what is now Birketts Farm, on Westhall Common, near Halesworth, Suffolk. He was the tenth and the youngest child in his family. His father, Thomas Davy, was a farmer. His mother, Sarah, was Thomas's second wife. She was the eldest daughter of William Gibson, surgeon of Carlton Colville and Willingham Hall, Beccles, Suffolk. Early in life Davy was apprenticed to a grocer at Halesworth, but his creative yearnings got the better of him and he left his apprenticeship to pursue drawing. Instead he became apprenticed to John Sell Cotman at Great Yarmouth, and assisted him in the etching of his Norfolk architectural views and illustrations of monumental brasses, published in 1818 and 1819. With this experience he issued his own series of ten etchings of Suffolk Antiquities including details of Beccles church, in 1818. In 1824 he married Sarah Bardwell, daughter of a master mariner in Southwold. Until 1829 he lived and worked in Southwold as an instructor in drawing and sketching from nature, and in the production of his own watercolours and etchings. Between 1823 and 1827 he issued a Collection of sixty etchings of further Suffolk Antiquities in parts, and these were re-issued (printed by Deck, in Ipswich) together with the earlier ten as A Series of Etchings Illustrative of the Architectural Antiquities of Suffolk in 1827. By this date he had also produced a series of Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen in Suffolk which contained only twenty plates, because, although many had subscribed, the funds contributed were not very large. In 1829 Davy moved to Ipswich and soon settled in Globe Street (now renamed St George's Street), from which address the large body of his subsequent etchings down to the 1860s were usually dated. His first years in Ipswich were difficult, and in 1833 he sold many of his books, plates and other possessions by auction. His later etchings, by which he is best known, were in general issued and sold individually. His preparations for them, at first showing particular attention to Suffolk churches, included a copious body of sketches, from which he distilled a mass of detail for the preparation of his plates. During the later 1830s and 1840s he also produced journalistic illustrations of public events, and made drawings of farming and agricultural subjects, and of archaeological finds."

In 1746, Blair married a surgeon's daughter named Nicholas [sic] Mitchell. In 1748, his brother (and guardian) John successfully sought to have the marriage annulled by the Commissary Court of Edinburgh. Hugh was alleged to have engaged in a number of unusual behaviors including: \n*  Collecting bird feathers, twigs, and pieces of cloth.  \n*  Always wearing the same piece of clothing. \n*  Requesting the same seat in church and engaging in repetitive acts. \n*  Attending every nearby burial, regardless of whether he knew the deceased.  \n*  Making unannounced visits to others and being oblivious to social cues. Modern writers have speculated that records of Hugh Blair might be consistent with a modern diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder."

  "text" : "Harvey N. Middleton (February 15, 1895 – March 18, 1978) was a physician and cardiologist in Indianapolis, Indiana, who is best known for his efforts to open opportunities for black physicians to serve on the staffs of Indianapolis hospitals and for his community service. Middleton was born in Denmark, South Carolina, and received a bachelor of arts degree from Benedict College (1919) in Columbia, South Carolina. He attended two years of medical school at Boston University before transferring to Meharry Medical College, in Nashville, Tennessee, where he received a medical degree (M.D.) in 1926. Middleton took short courses for additional training at Harvard University; the University of London, England; the University of Michigan; Indiana University; and Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago. In 1928 Middleton moved to Anderson, Indiana, where he joined the staff of Saint Johns Hospital. Around 1935 he relocated to Indianapolis, established a private medical practice, and volunteered at Indianapolis General (City) Hospital's outpatient heart clinic. Middleton was accepted as a member of City Hospital staff in 1942 and joined the staffs at other Indianapolis hospitals. Middleton wrote several articles relating to cardiology that appear in state and national medical journals. He was a member of the American Medical Association, the National Medical Association, the American Heart Association, the Indiana State Medical Association, the Hoosier State Medical Society, and others. Middleton, a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was actively involved in Indianapolis philanthropic and social organizations, most notably in leadership roles in the Young Men's Christian Association. He was particularly active in Indianapolis's Senate Avenue YMCA and its successor, the Fall Creek Parkway YMCA. Middleton served on state-level YMCA committees and was a member of the YMCA's national council and a delegate to the International YMCA Conference (1955). He co-chaired the United Negro College Fund's Indiana fundraising campaign (1950–51) and was a board member of the Indianapolis Community Chest. Middleton was active in the Zeta Phi chapter of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity and a member of Indianapolis's Mount Paran Baptist Church. He is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery, Indianapolis, Indiana."

  "text" : "Hinrich Nitsche (14 February 1845, in Breslau – 8 November 1902, in Tharandt) was a German zoologist. He was a son-in-law to geographer Oscar Peschel (1826-1875). He studied zoology at the Universities of Heidelberg and Berlin, obtaining his doctorate at the latter institution in 1868. After graduation, he worked as an assistant to Rudolf Leuckart at the University of Leipzig. During the Franco-Prussian War, he served as a volunteer medical assistant. In 1875 he became an associate professor of zoology at Leipzig, and during the following year was appointed professor of zoology at the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry in Tharandt. In 1869-70 he divided the phylum Bryozoa into two groups, Endoprocta and Ectoprocta, with the latter group of animals being characterized by having its anus outside of the crown of tentacles, as opposed to Endoprocta. Today the term \"Ectoprocta\" is considered to be synonymous with Bryozoa. The herpetological species Nitsche's bush viper (Atheris nitschei ) is named in his honor."

  "text" : "Henrik Lund-Nielsen (born February 3, 1965 in Nyborg, Denmark) is a Danish business executive and serial-entrepreneur. He is chief executive officer (CEO) at Gypsum Recycling International A/S and an investor in and founder of several Danish growth companies mainly within the mobile and internet sector. Henrik Lund-Nielsen is mostly known from his latest role as CEO and co-owner of Gypsum Recycling International A/S, a Danish plasterboard and gypsum recycling group. Based on a world record of 80% recycling rate for gypsum waste in Denmark, he grew the company from an initially marginal Danish presence to the world leader in recycling of gypsum plasterboard (drywall) waste with several European subsidiaries and business in the US and Asia. During his leadership the company has won several environmental awards within the clean tech field, such as Vækstfondens Cleantech Award in 2007 as the most promising Danish clean tech company and the “Recycler of the year” award in Sweden in 2010. The company has also been awarded for their contribution to fighting climate change by receiving PricewaterhouseCoopers award for climate reduction in 2008, and Henrik Lund-Nielsen was profiled at the official stand at the United Nations Cop 15 climate summit in Denmark in 2009 as one of the leading Danish climate profiles. With the establishment and international expansion of the gypsum recycling system, Henrik Lund-Nielsen is seen as the founding father of plasterboard recycling in Europe. He is a frequent speaker at several international conferences on waste, recycling and gypsum such as the recurring Global Gypsum Conference. Since 2011 Henrik Lund-Nielsen has been the vice-chairman of the Danish Innovation network for environmental technology and The European Commission has also called upon him on more occasions to lecture on how effective recycling systems are established and run. Henrik Lund-Nielsen holds a Master of Science in Economics from the Copenhagen Business School (Denmark) and in 1991 completed a MBA at U.S. international University (now Alliant International University) in San Diego (USA) where he received The President’s Award for outstanding academic performance. After finishing his MBA, Henrik Lund-Nielsen joined Skandinavisk Industries A/S, the second largest office furniture manufacturer in Europe, where he advanced several times having been the CEO of various subsidiaries to subsequently become Divisional Director in 1998. From 1999 until 2003 he served as CEO/Managing Director at Faber A/S and Faber Holding A/S, which at that time had 1.000 employees and was the second largest manufacturer of window treatments in Europe owned by Velux. Henrik Lund-Nielsen is married to his wife Katja Remvig. They live with their two children in Gentofte, Denmark."

The fax asked that Watson be made \"'available to work with the team' of Americans attending international climate change meetings.\" Later in 2001, he was appointed by the George W. Bush administration as Special Envoy to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, for which he held the rank of ambassador.

  "text" : "Henry Colton Shumway was an American soldier and artist. He was born in Middletown, Connecticut in 1807 and died in New York City in 1884. Shumway studied at the Academy of Design in New York City. He painted Governor John Trumbull, Daniel Webster, John Frazee (sculptor) and Henry Clay. At the height of his career, his paintings sold for three hundred dollars. With the advent of photography in the 1860s, Shumway and other artists stopped miniature painting and produced hand-colored daguerreotypes. Shumway worked in Connecticut, New Orleans, and for a long period in New York where he exhibited his work from 1829 to 1860. He did miniature paintings. Later in his career he did large rectangular works."

  "text" : "Harry Weldon (1 February 1881 – 10 March 1930) was an English comedian and music hall performer popular in the 1910s. Although Weldon's work is almost forgotten today his most well known sketch was \"Stiffy the Goalkeeper\" that was recorded in January 1912 with Charlie Chaplin. The sketch was so successful it had a fourteen-week run in London and after the sketch's run ended Weldon still used Stiffy as his main character, notably in one of his final sketches \"Stiffy the Warder\" that was recorded in June 1928. Weldon had a famous boxing skit in 1916 entitled \"The White Hope\". Weldon's real name was James Henry Stanley and he was born on 1 February 1881 in Liverpool. He appeared at two Royal Command shows and took ill in 1923 but returned to his career after his illness. He died after taking ill while touring in South Africa on 10 March 1930 at the age of 49. Musichallcds.com released a CD of Weldon in 2008 entitled \"The White Hope\" after his famous boxing skit."
