Withers was first hired about 1943 to understudy the leading ladies in the Broadway casts of Oklahoma! and Carousel. She soon replaced the original star of Carousel, playing Julie Jordan more than 600 times on Broadway and becoming the first Julie in London in 1950. She was next a replacement for Adelaide in Guys and Dolls. She was a replacement or standby in more than a half dozen other Broadway shows throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and she also toured North America in the leading roles in Carousel, South Pacific and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Her last Broadway role was in Forty Carats (1968–1970), after which she left show business."

  "text" : "Irbis Seguy (I Pi She Kui) was a ruler of the Western Turkic Khaganate (Western Turkic Empire) in the 7th century. He was Ishbara Tolis's grandson. In 642, he succeeded Yukuk Shad a member of Ashina dynasty from the Eastern Khaganate. Although, Yukuk Shad was still active and controlling a part of the territory, Irbis Seguy had the support of Nushibi tribes. During the early years of his reign the rivalry between the Nushibi and Dulo clan cooled off. In 646 he applied to Tang China for marrying a royal princess. Emperor Taizong of Tang however stipulated the return of several Silk Road cities to China. This request ended the short term peace between China and the Western Khaganate. Two years later several Dulo leaders took refuge in China. With them the khaganate also lost Dzungaria (roughly the northern half of present Chinese Turkestan) to China. In 651 Irbis Seguy was defeated by Hallig (his grandfather's nephew) who was supported by the Dulo klan (and probably Tang China)."

  "text" : "Icchok Malmed (יצחק מאַלמעד) (born 1903 in Brześć nad Bugiem - 8 February 1943 in Białystok, Poland) was a Polish Jew and fighter of the Białystok Ghetto during the German occupation of Poland in World War II. On January 1943 German soldiers started the liquidation of the ghetto in Białystok. When they attacked the house at ul. Kupiecka 29 (Kupiecka Street), rounding up all of its residents into the street, Malmed threw acid in the face of one the SS-Soldiers. The sightless German fired his gun several times, hitting another SS-Soldier, killing him. In the melee Malmed managed to escape. For revenge Germans shot with machine guns one hundred men, women and children living in the area where the incident occurred. The Gestapo commander Friedl issued an ultimatum for Malmed to surrender within 24 hours. Failing that, the entire ghetto would be destroyed. Malmed surrendered himself to the Germans. Mordechaj Tenenbaum described in his diary Malmed’s courage. Asked why he killed the German soldier, he replied: “I hate you. I regret I only killed one. Before my eyes my parents were murdered. Ten thousand Jews in Słonim were liquidated before me. I have no regrets.” Malmed was tortured and on the next day hanged near the square where the incident occurred. Germans soldiers riddled Malmed’s corpse with bullets after the rope broke and the body fell to the earth and re-hanged it for another 48 hours. Malmed is considered as \"Hero of the Białystok Ghetto\", the ul. Kupiecka was renamed after the war in ul. Malmeda (Malmed Street)."

  "text" : "Ibn Arafa, born Mohammed bin Mohammed bin Arafa al-Werghemmi, in 1316 in Tunis and died in 1401 in the same city, was a Tunisian Imam, the most illustrious representative of Maliki Islam to the Hafsid period. From the south-east of Tunisia, he had knowledge of law, of grammar, of rhetoric, of mathematics, and of medicine that enabled him to lead the prestigious Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the University of Ez-Zitouna for several years. Staunch defender of Maliki Islam, he did not hesitate to come into direct conflict with several Sufi of his time as the esoteric and religious practices he witnessed were beyond the precepts of Islam and the understanding of the faithful. He also had conflicts with Ibn Khaldun who he suspected had non-religious motives. Khaldun, in turn, accused Ibn Arafa of being jealous of his popularity. As a theologian, Ibn Arafa was a strict and pure Maliki, and a powerful figure especially in Tunisia. He was also the author of numerous books on law, theology, and logic. Such books are stored at Zaytuna, in Tunisia. At his death in 1401, he was buried in Djellaz Cemetery located in the old medina of Tunis, which has been preserved as the oldest historical monument of the state."

He made his film debut in Jang's black comedy The Happenings in 1998, and through the years has become one of the most versatile supporting actors in Korean cinema, with notable roles in Three... Extremes and Le Grand Chef. But Im is best known for his iconic role Dachimawa Lee, which began in 2000 as the title character of a 35-minute short film that director Ryoo Seung-wan made as a parody/homage to '70s Korean genre action films. The internet short was enormously popular and received more than a million page views, and in 2008, Ryoo again cast Im in an action-comedy feature film based on the same character, Dachimawa Lee."

  "text" : "I. Valerian (born Valeriu Ionescu; August 1, 1895 – November 21, 1980) was a Romanian writer and journalist. Born in Ivești, Galați County, the son of Fotache, a worker and clerk active in Ivești and Tecuci, and his wife Amalia, he spent his childhood in Tecuci. There he attended school at the primary and gymnasium levels before going to Vasile Alecsandri High School in Galați from 1907 to 1915. In 1917, during World War I, he graduated from the Military Reserve Officers' School in Bucharest, going on to participate in the Battle of Mărăști as part of the 2nd Army under Alexandru Averescu. Wounded on August 6, he was promoted to lieutenant and made a knight of the Order of the Crown. Between 1917 and 1921, he recuperated at Bârlad, working together with Alexandru Vlahuță and George Tutoveanu, becoming a member of Academia Bârlădeană and making his debut with verses in Florile Dalbe. He married professor Elena Ganea in 1922, fathering five children. Moving to Bucharest in 1925, he was active in the Sburătorul circle, publishing verses in its Revista literară magazine. He joined the Romanian Writers' Society (SSR) in 1922, and in 1925 graduated from the Literature and Philosophy Faculty of the University of Bucharest, magna cum laude. His first published book, Caravanele tăcerii (\"The Caravans of Silence\"), appeared in 1923, and it received a prize from the Romanian Academy the following year. In 1925, he was elected a member of the Royal Romanian Geographical Society. In February 1926, he began editing Viața Literară, which appeared almost continuously until June 1941 in 322 issues, promoting important figures in the country's cultural and literary life, as well as helping to launch the careers of younger writers. According to George Călinescu, Valerian, through this magazine and Sentinela (1939-1944), showed a wide-ranging vision in a narrow-minded era. He received positive reviews for his volume of verse Stampe (1927) and for his novel Cara Su (1936). He worked in the military teaching department of the Education Ministry from 1932 to 1937, headed the Office of Romanian Youth Education (1937-1938) and belonged to the leadership of Straja Țării. During World War II, from 1941 to 1944, he headed a department in the press section of the Ministry of National Propaganda; he was also promoted to a leadership function within the SSR. In 1943, he remarried; his second wife was Aurelia Grigoriță Tomescu (1906-1987), who wrote under the pseudonym Grig Malciu. Sent into retirement in 1945, he was active in the voluntary association for supporting national defense (AVSAP). In 1967, he was readmitted into what the Communist regime had refashioned as the Writers' Union of Romania. He published Cu scriitorii în veac, a well-received volume based on 39 interviews with prominent Romanian writers. In 1969-1970, he released a revised version of Cara Su as well as the study Chipuri din Viața Literară. He died in 1980."

His first opera A Harlot's Progress to a libretto by Peter Ackroyd premiered on 13 October 2013 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, conducted by Mikko Franck and directed by Jens-Daniel Herzog. The cast included Marie McLaughlin as Mother Needham and Nathan Gunn as James Dalton. The lead role of Moll Hackabout was created by German coloratura soprano Diana Damrau for whom the composer has written a great deal of music. Bell's second opera is an adaptation of Charles Dickens's own one-man version of his novella A Christmas Carol commissioned by Houston Grand Opera where it received its world premiere in December 2014, directed by the British actor, director and writer Simon Callow. The singer who played all the roles in the piece is the American tenor Jay Hunter Morris. The opera was subsequently nominated in the World Premiere category at the 2015 International Opera Awards and will have its UK premiere at Welsh National Opera in a new production by Polly Graham in December 2015. Bell's third opera is an adaptation of the 1937 First World War epic poem In Parenthesis by David Jones. It was commissioned by Welsh National Opera and will receive its world premiere in May 2016 at the Wales Millennium Centre with further performances at the Royal Opera House in a production by David Pountney conducted by Carlo Rizzi. Bell's chamber music has been performed internationally at venues including Carnegie Hall, the Alte Oper Frankfurt and Wigmore Hall, the last having commissioned a song cycle from him premiered in June 2014, setting extracts of Shakespeare's fools, entitled These Motley Fools. It was premiered by the American countertenor Lawrence Zazzo.

It was epitomised locally in the work of architects such as Miles Warren, Maurice Mahoney (Warren & Mahoney) and Paul Pascoe. Holmes engineered many of Canterbury's first modernist buildings including the Dorset Street Flats, the SIMU building, the Students' Association building at Canterbury University and the Christchurch Town Hall. He also worked in Vanuatu (then called the New Hebrides) and the Solomon Islands engineering hospitals, schools, a Government House and a cathedral. Holmes was 49 when he died part way through construction of the Christchurch Town Hall."

  "text" : "Iain Anders, (born Iain Anders Robertson; 8 February 1933 – 5 September 1997) was an English actor known for his roles in Taggart and A Horseman Riding By. Iain Anders Robertson was born to Scottish parents in 1933 in London. His career as an actor included many crime-related roles, and in this way paralleled his off-screen life, where he worked as a legal executive for a law firm specialising in criminal law, preparing court briefs. On screen, Anders appeared in small parts in many series, often playing either policemen or criminals. Among these were appearances in such shows as Z-Cars, Softly, Softly, and Juliet Bravo. His first screen appearance was as a prison officer in 1965 in Three Clear Sundays, a play in the \"Wednesday Play\" series. He also appeared on stage throughout England and Scotland during the 1950s and 1960s. His first stage appearance was as an extra in a performance of Shakespeare's Henry V in Birmingham. In 1985, Anders was also introduced into the television show Taggart, playing Superintendent Jack \"The Biscuit\" McVitie, alongside Mark McManus, who played the title character. It is for this role that he is most widely remembered, playing the role in 40 episodes, three of which did not screen until after his death. In his spare time, Anders was an expert at contract bridge, which he taught at the London School of Bridge."

  "text" : "Ivan Rutkovych (Ukrainian: Іван Руткович), born about 1650`s. in Bilyi Kamin, near Zolochiv, Ukraine, died after 1708, was a Ukrainian icon painter who worked mostly in Zhovkva and Univ. He is considered a founder of Zhovkva Iconographic School of painting and wood carving. Some of Rutkovych's work was lost, but there is still a significant amount of well-preserved icons, as well as iconostases, made by Rutkovych together with other masters. There are iconostases of the wooden churches in Volytsia Derevlianska (1680–82), Volia Vysotska (1688–89); the large (10,85 х 11,87 m) iconostasis of the Church of Christ`s Nativity in Zhovkva (also known as iconostasis from Nova Skvariava) (1697–99), now in Lviv National Museum. The last is considered as a masterpiece among Ukrainian iconostases of that time. It consists from 7 rows of icons. It was restored and exhibited to the public in 2009. Also in Lviv National Museum are preserved separate icons, among them Supplication (1683) from Potelych village, Lviv region. The artistic style of Ivan Rutkovych combines Ukrainian-Byzantine tradition of expressing religious subjects with modern European influences, more secular and realistic. Rutkovych is a most prominent representative of Zhovkva Iconographic School of painting and wood carving. According to art historians, in that time new iconographical cannons were established, giving free rein to the artist to reveal his individual style with maximum care for detail. A score of local schools sprang up in Sudova Vyshnia, Zhovkva, Robotychi, Volyn region and other. The iconostasis of The Holy Trinity Church in Zhovkva shows contribution of different masters, among them Vasyl Petranovych (icon of Savoir, icon of Our Lady), Hnat Stobensky (carving of the Holy Door) and Ivan Rutkovych himself (Annunciation, Christmas, Archangel Michael). The Church is placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 2013. In Lviv, there is the street named after Ivan Rutkovych."

He had been implicated in the 1954 Petrov Affair during which he was named by an Australian Royal Commission as a KGB agent. During his time at the Department of External Affairs, his code name was said to have been \"Bur\". Later when a New Zealand newspaper, Truth, labelled him \"a Red menace\", two universities that had invited him to lecture in New Zealand withdrew their invitation. Ian Milner was the son of one of New Zealand's most respected headmasters, Frank Milner, of Waitaki Boys' High School in Oamaru, usually known as \"the Man\". He was one of a group of five young New Zealand scholars who went to Oxford University in the 1930s and subsequently distinguished themselves in war and revolution."

  "text" : "Irina Konstantinova-Bontemps (Bulgarian: Ирина Константинова; born 10 July 1976 in Sofia) is a Bulgarian windsurfer, who specialized in Neil Pryde RS:X class. She represented Bulgaria in four editions of the Olympic Games (2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012), and has also placed outside the top ten in both Mistral and RS:X classes. In 2006, Konstantinova married French windsurfer, two-time world champion, and later 2008 Olympic silver medalist Julien Bontemps before she relocated to France, and trained for ASPTT Nantes. As of September 2013, Konstantinova is ranked no. 88 in the world for the sailboard class by the International Sailing Federation. Konstantinova made her official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where she placed twenty-fourth in women's Mistral sailboard with a net score of 193 points. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Konstantinova posted a remarkable grade of 152 to pull off a nineteenth-place effort in the same program. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Konstantinova narrowly missed out on the medal race by four points, as she finished twelfth overall in the newly introduced RS:X class with a net score of 101. Twelve years after competing in her first Olympics, Konstantinova qualified for her fourth Bulgarian team, as a 36-year-old, in the RS:X class at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London by receiving a berth from the ISAF Sailing World Championships in Perth, Western Australia. Delivering a mediocre effort in the opening races, Konstantinova dropped to twenty-second place overall in a fleet of twenty-six sailors with a net score of 180 points."

  "text" : "Ian Almond (born 1969, Skipton, England) is a literary scholar and writer. He is Professor of World Literature at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar. Educated in the UK, Almond received his PhD in Literature at Edinburgh University. He worked for University of Bari (Italy), Erciyes University and Boğaziçi University (Turkey), Frei University (Germany), and Georgia State University, before coming to Georgetown University School of Foreign Service Qatar in 2013. His specializations consist of Post-colonial theory, South Asian literature, representations of Islam and world literature. He's particularly known for his works on Islam. He is the author of five books. His books have been translated into several languages, including Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Korean, Indonesian and Bosnian/Serbo-Croat. As a historian, Almond seems to be most interested in showing how Islam has been an overlooked factor in the formation of Europe. Two Faiths, One Banner is a history of Muslim-Christian military alliances in Europe. In History of Islam in German Thought (ISBN 978-0415897792), Almond shows that Marx, Hegel, Nietzsche and Kant knew a lot more about Islam than they let on. In his work on philosophy, Almond argues that many postmodernists rely on an Orientalist stock of tropes when it comes to writing about Islam. In his writings on literature, Almond seems to be most interested in exposing the repressed spirituality of allegedly secular authors."

The letters tell us that Queen Iltani worked hard at running the palace industries, in particular the textiles and food, and had to meet her husband’s frequent, urgent demands for goods and personnel. She had to deal with many letters from individuals asking for help or resources, and she was concerned with her own health, querulous and indignant. Iltani’s work as overseer of the textile business in the palace of Rimah is well documented in the archive. The “department of Iltani,” as the business was called, employed 15 women and 10 men. Iltani was also involved in the metal trade; she personally received copper from her male subordinate. Belassunu was Iltani's sister."

Guevara sailed in 1534 the first voyage of Pedro de Mendoza and with a group of 1,500 colonists, including twenty women, bound for the Río de la Plata region of what is now Argentina. According to Spanish archives, she “suffered all the discomforts and dangers of the conquest.” De Guevara's correspondences paint one of the most elaborate, enduring portraits of the hazards of colonial life. Within three months of arrival, because of hostile indigenous people, starvation, and hardship, Isabel de Guevara estimated that a thousand of the settlers who had arrived with her in the New World had died of hunger. Estimates by other colonists at the time went as high as 10,000."

  "text" : "Isaac Hinckley (1815-1888) was a president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad and the founder of Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. Hinckley was born on Oct. 28, 1815, in Hingham, Massachusetts, a son of Isaac Hinckley (1793-1818), who had gone to sea at a young age and rose to command three ships: the brig Reaper (1809–10), which he sailed on a trading voyage from Boston to Aden and Calcutta; the ship Tartar (1812–13), on another voyage to Calcutta; and finally the ship Canton (1815–18) for three voyages from Boston to Guangdong, China. He died while homebound on the third of these. The shipmaster left a widow in Hingham and six children, aged 2 to 11, including three-year-old Isaac. The younger Isaac Hinckley graduated from Harvard University in 1834. He took his first railroad job in 1846, as Superintendent of Transportation for the Boston and Providence Railroad and worked there until January 1848. He then took other railroad jobs and on April 1, 1865, was appointed president of the PW&B. He was also president of the Junction Railroad, the short line built to connect the PW&B and three other railroads in West Philadelphia. In 1880 and 1881, Hinckley helped the PRR take control of the PW&B, a move that ultimately forced the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to build a costly new southwest approach to Philadelphia. On Dec. 12, 1887, Hinckley chartered Ridley Park, a borough to the southwest of Philadelphia, in an effort to create an analog to the Philadelphia Main Line string of suburbs founded and served, lucratively, by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Hinckley died in Philadelphia, still the president of the PW&B, on March 28, 1888."

  "text" : "Ignaz Alberti (11 April 1760, in Vienna - 31 August 1794, in Vienna) was an Austrian illustrator, engraver and book printer. He employed some 20 engravers in 1787 who applied their skills to cartography and botanical books. After his untimely death his widow managed the printing and publication. His 1796 Vienna edition of the New Testament was printed and published by his widow, was banned by the Catholic Church, and appeared without imprimatur. Alberti engraved and printed the frontispiece for the original libretto of Mozart's Die Zauberflöte in Vienna in 1791. He was one of Mozart's fellow Masons in the Lodge Zur gekrönten Hoffung. The frontispiece was so richly embellished with Masonic symbolism that it was removed from all subsequent editions of the libretto. Another publication to which Mozart contributed his final three lieder (K. 596-8), was the Liedersammlung für Kinder und Kinderfreunde am Clavier published in 1791 by Ignaz Alberti - this was the first in a set of four volumes of children’s songs to be published in Vienna. Alberti was instrumental in the preparing, printing and publishing many volumes on natural history, librettos, oratory and other topics. Among these were \n* Joachim Johann Nepomuk Spalowsky's \"Prodromus in Systema Historicum Testaceorum\" published posthumously in 1795 by his widow. \n* Mauerrede auf Mozarts Tod\"' 1792 \n* Dankopfer Franz dem Zweyten, Kaiser der Deutschen 1792 \n* Die ganze heilige Schrift, nach der in der Katholischen Kirche 1791-3 \n* Ovid's Verwandlungen in Kupfern und mit den nöthigen erlaäuterungen versehen heraus gegeben von einer Gesellschaft 1791-93. \n* Emanuel Schikaneder's Die Zauberflöte 1791. \n* Liedersammlung für Kinder und Kinderfreunde am Clavier 1791. \n* Trauerrede auf Joseph II. zur Gedächtnisfeier gehalten in einer Versammlung der F. M. in derLoge zur gekr. Hofn. im Or. zu Wien 1790. Alberti is sometimes confused with the engraver Ignaz Albrecht. \n* Publications - selection  \n* Primula elatiorIcones Plantarum Medico-Oeconomico-Technologicarum \n* Frontispiece of the first edition of Die Zauberflöte (1791) \n* Old Testament published in Vienna (1793) \n* Joachim Johann Nepomuk Spalowsky's \"Prodromus in Systema Historicum Testaceorum\" (1795)"

He was born in Iran and was the son of Prince Alexander of Kartli. His father moved to Russia in 1757 and was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the Russian imperial army. His brother Kirill was a major-general of the Russian army and a member of the Governing Senate. Prince Ivan was a Second-Major of Russian army. He did not know the Russian language and retired very soon. He served at Kizlyar fortress.

Abkhazi, born of a princely family from Kakheti, was one of the first Georgian noblemen who joined the Russian military on the Tsar's annexation of Georgia in 1800. He rose in seniority during the war with Iran (1804–13), being an aide to General Pyotr Kotlyarevsky. He was promoted to major in 1812, colonel in 1821, and major-general in 1826. He was instrumental in defeating the rebel prince Aslan-Bey in Abkhazia in the 1820s. During the second war with Iran (1826–28) Abkhazi was chief of staff of General Nikita Pankratiev's corps and then a military administrator of the South Caucasian Muslim provinces. In 1830, he commanded a punitive force which forced the Ingush and Ossetian highlanders into submission. His service had been awarded by the Order of St. George, 4th Rank (1813). Count Ivan Paskevich, his former superior in the Caucasus, summoned Abkhazi to service in Warsaw on his transfer to Poland, but Abkhazi died on his way to a new appointment."

  "text" : "Isaac Webb (born from September 1793 to June 1794 - died in 1840, before June) - shipbuilder, owner of shipyard Isaac Webb & Co. that he founded. Later this shipyard was renamed Webb & Allen due to Isaac took a partner. In 1843 his son William Henry Webb bought out his father's old partner John Allen and subsequently renamed the business William H. Webb. In September 1810, Henry Eckford took on 16-year-old Isaac Webb as an apprentice at his shipyard in New York. In the following years, Eckford would take on many other apprentices who would become important naval architects and shipbuilders, including Jacob Bell, William Bennett, David Brown, Andrew Craft, John Dimon, John Englis, Thomas Megson, Stephen Smith, and Sidney Wright.After completing his training he opened his own shipyard, Isaac Webb & Co., near Corlears Hook in about 1818, later relocating to Stanton Street. Isaac eventually took on a partner and the firm was renamed Webb & Allen. It looks like two other apprentices Jacob Bell and David Brown founded Brown & Bell shipyard in New York and built the famous sidewheel steamer USS Jacob Bell. William Henry Webb, son of Isaac Webb, was born in New York on June 19, 1816.William was educated privately and at Columbia College Grammar School, demonstrating a natural aptitude for mathematics. He built his first boat, a small skiff, at the age of twelve, and in spite of his parents' wishes to the contrary, secured an apprenticeship at his father's shipyard at the age of fifteen. At twenty, he was awarded a subcontract for the New York-Liverpool packet ship Oxford, his first commercial contract. After completing his six-year apprenticeship, William decided to further his education by traveling to Scotland in 1840 to visit the famous shipyards of the Clyde. However during this journey his father Isaac Webb died suddenly at the age of 46, and 23-year-old William returned home to assume management of the shipyard. Upon examining the accounts, William discovered that his father's business was technically insolvent, and thus one of his first duties was to settle his father's debts. Having done so, he set about reinvigorating the business. William Henry Webb was a \"born mathematician\" in an era when shipbuilding was considered as much an art as a science. He brought new levels of professionalism to the craft by combining the art of design with the discipline of careful mathematical calculation. For this reason, William has been described as America's first true naval architect. William was content to start small, however. For the first couple of years at the helm, the Webb & Allen shipyard, now located between Fifth and Seventh Streets on the East River, built a variety of mostly small sailing ships, including ferries, sloops and schooners. William bought out his father's old partner John Allen in 1843 and subsequently renamed the business William H. Webb."

He was a member of the Byzantine Gabras family, very likely identical with, or possibly the son of, an unnamed member of the family who defected to the Sultan in the late reign of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180), became a leading member of the Seljuk court, and served as the Seljuk ambassador to the Emperor during the Myriokephalon campaign of 1175–76. Ikthyar himself is safely attested from ca. 1180 on, when he led negotiations with Saladin. He held the post of vizier until Kilij Arslan's death in 1192. According to A. Bryer, he was \"regarded as a wise statesman and noted for the splendour of his robes and personal jewelry\". Nevertheless, it is possible that he (or a possible son) is the \"Ghawras\" who was accused of poisoning the Sultan and his heir, Kaykhusraw I, in 1192. After Kilij Arslan's death, he was dismissed from his office and made for his estates near Erzincan, where he intended to retire, but was waylaid and killed on the way by Turkmen raiders. His estates were then claimed by the Mengujekid emir Bahramshah."

  "text" : "Izzet Mehmed Pasha (1723 – February 1784, Belgrade) was an Ottoman statesman who served as the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire twice, first from 1774 to 1775, and second from 1781 to 1782. Towards the end of Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774), he was the sadaret kaymakamı, deputy to the grand vizier who served in the absence of the grand vizier. Sultan Abdülhamit I appointed him as grand vizier on 10 August 1774. His first term ended on 7 July 1775. Six years later, while he was serving as the governor of Erzurum Eyalet, he was reappointed as the grand vizier on 20 February 1781. His main task was reforming the army which was unsuccessful in the war. But in this task he failed to satisfy the sultan, and furthermore, a fire in Istanbul caused great damage and riots, leading to his dismissal by the sultan on 25 August 1782 and exile to Plovdiv. Apart from the grand viziership, Izzet Mehmed Pasha also held other high-level posts. He became a vizier on 6 July 1774, and he served as the Ottoman governor of Aidin (1775), Egypt (1775–78), Sivas (1778–79), Erzurum (1779, 1780–81), Rakka (1779–80), and Belgrade (1783–84). He died in February 1784 in Belgrade while in office as its governor."

  "text" : "Ivon George Murdoch MC and bar (1892–1958), also known as Ivan Murdoch was an Australian Army officer during World War I, notable for the rare distinction of twice being awarded the Military Cross (MC) for bravery. Both nominations and awards were made within the space of one calendar year (1918). While Murdoch entered the army with rank of Private, he was later commissioned as an officer and reached the rank of Lieutenant. Murdoch was the son of an immigrant Scottish Presbyterian minister and theologian, the Rev. Patrick Murdoch (1850–1940) and his wife Helen, née Garden (1826–1945); he was also the younger brother of a prominent journalist and newspaper executive, Sir Keith Murdoch (the father of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch). When he enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 26 July 1915, Ivon Murdoch stated that his occupation was \"Farmer\" and his home address as Riversdale Road, Camberwell, Victoria. He was assigned initially to the 1–8 Reinforcements, 24th Battalion, which gave him the Service Number 3184. Murdoch was posted to the Western Front with the 8th Battalion. Murdoch's first MC resulted from him leading extended night patrols, during March and April 1918, south-east of Ypres, Belgium in No Man's Land and behind German lines, which captured a pillbox and returned wounded men to Australian positions. His second MC was awarded for actions during August 1918 that successfully: \n*  defended recently captured German field guns near Rosieres, France and; \n*  set up a machine gun enfilade, during the Battle of Lihons (part of the Hundred Days Offensive)."

  "text" : "Ian H. Boyden (born February 16, 1971) is a contemporary American painter, sculptor, and book artist, known for the paints and inks he makes from materials such as meteorites, shark teeth, and freshwater pearls. His paintings are often abstract interpretations of how the pigment materials are understood according to historical, literary, and psychological contexts. Boyden’s early years were spent under the influence of the artist Margot Thompson, a student of northwest calligrapher and philosopher Lloyd Reynolds, and Boyden’s father, ceramic artist Frank Boyden. He earned a B.A. in Art History from Wesleyan University (1995), and an M.A. in the History of Art from Yale University (1998). In 1995, He received a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship to study the history of Chinese calligraphy as inscribed in stone. Boyden’s scholarly and artistic interests in inkmaking are rooted in his discovery of ancient Chinese ink recipes. His inkmaking practice and scholarly investigations involve how ingredients function esoterically as well as practically in the resultant paintings. On the basis of his contributions to the study of ink, he was invited to be the 2011-12 scholarly artist-in-residence for Suzhou University (Jiangsu Province, China). During that time, the Suzhou-based Jincheng Media Group invited him to be the 2012 artist-in-residence and to both produce paintings and install conceptual sculptures in the fish ponds of the site’s classical Chinese garden. The work culminated in a solo exhibition of books, paintings, and video at the Suzhou Museum. Boyden’s artist books demonstrate traditional bookmaking practices of sewn bindings, wood covers, handset type, and letterpess printing. Other books depart from such tradition and apply the understanding of a book as a sequenced experience to objects like meteorites, which are sliced and set into a hinged binding so they can be \"read\" as both objects of scientific interest and structural interpretation. Boyden has collaborated with writers Sam Hamill (Habitations, Edible Earth, and Crossing the Yellow River); and spouse, Jennifer Boyden (Evidence of Night, and Twenty Views of Cascade Head); and artists Timothy Ely, Rick Bartow, Hua Rende, Ch’ang Chung-Ho, and William Balcom. Boyden’s sculptures explore self-portraiture that he makes out of a variety of materials that are then given back to the environment to be completed by apetites of birds, bear, fish, and so forth. Boyden describes these pieces as explorations of Buddhist ecology. These self-portraits were the subject of his TEDx talk \"'Eradicate the Self' Self-Portrait.\" Boyden is currently the Director of the San Juan Islands Museum of Art, Friday Harbor, Washington."

Ida von Schulzenheim is known as the founder of Föreningen Svenska Konstnärinnor (The Society of Swedish Female Artists) in 1910. She also served as its first chairperson. She founded the society to make female artists, who were often not given as much attention as their male colleagues, better possibility to be known and appreciated for their art, and not to actually draw the attention to their gender as such:\" You do not actually think, that we female artists would wish to become known merely for being women? I mean, would we wish to exhibit by ourselves, unless we were forced to?\" Ida von Schulzenheim was given the Litteris et Artibus in 1927."
