  "text" : "Judy Carmichael (born November 27, 1957) is a Grammy-nominated jazz pianist and vocalist who is one of the few jazz pianists honored as a Steinway Artist. She specializes in a rare form of pre-1950s jazz, stride piano, a highly physical style of playing first made popular by Thomas \"Fats\" Waller. The music was long associated with big, powerful—mostly black - men, so when Carmichael first emerged on the scene - a young, thin, white, ex-beauty queen, it was a shock. Critic Count Basie was so taken with Carmichael's playing that he nicknamed her \"Stride\". With stride piano, the pianist alternates low bass notes on beats one and three with chords on beats two and four with their left hand  and plays figures and improvised lines with their right. \"What made me unusual when I started doing that was that all the people playing stride were big men, and I was a surfer girl from California,\" she told The New York Times. Reviewing her first album Two-Handed Stride in 1980, Scott Yanow wrote: \"The recording debut of pianist Judy Carmichael was a major, if somewhat unheralded event. The first important stride pianist to emerge in nearly 30 years, Carmichael has proved to be a consistently creative and exciting performer (rather than imitative) within the genre of classic jazz and swing during the years since her debut. For this set (originally out on Progressive and knotty reissued on CD) Carmichael is joined by altoist Marshall Royal, guitarist Freddie Green, bassist Red Callender, and drummer Harold Jones which gives some of the music a Count Basie feel. However, Carmichael's own musical personality was already nearly fully formed by the date. Highlights of the joyous music include \"Christopher Columbus\", \"Honeysuckle Rose\", \"A Handful of Keys\" and \"I Would Do Anything for You.\" Carmichael is listed in American Women in Jazz, Who's Who in American Woman, Who's Who in the East, Who's Who in Finance and Industry in America, Who's Who in the World and in the Encyclopedia of Jazz. On radio, Carmichael has been a guest performer on Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion, and also made radio appearances on NPR’s Morning Edition. She primarily appears on radio as the host of Public Radio's Judy Carmichael's Jazz Inspired, a radio program that interviews creative people from all walks of life who talk about their creative process, and how their interest in jazz has affected that process. On television, she has appeared on Entertainment Tonight and CBS Sunday Morning, both with host Charles Kuralt and with Charles Osgood. Her show appears on American public radio, as well as Sirius/XM's NPR Now channel. She also writes articles for JazzTimes. She produced and hosted a fifteen-part series for public radio: Pet Style Radio with Judy Carmichael."

  "text" : "Sir John Silvester (7 September 1745 – 30 March 1822) Bt, FRS, FSA, DCL, was an English lawyer and Common Serjeant of London from 1790 to 1803, and Recorder of London, the senior Circuit Judge at the Central Criminal Court (the Old Bailey), from 1803 until his death in 1822. Born in Yardley House in Chingford, Silvester was the son of Sir John Baptist Silvester M.D., FRS (died 1789), of Dutch descent and physician to the army in the Low Countries, under the Duke of Cumberland during the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1753 aged 8 John Silvester attended Merchant Taylors' School when James Townley was the Headmaster. He took part in the theatrical activities encouraged by Townley and was Head Monitor in 1761. He attended St John's College, Oxford from 1764 and took his BCL in 1771. On qualifying in the Law he became a barrister at the Old Bailey. Originally a City Common Pleader, in 1790 he was chosen by the City of London Corporation to take up the post of Common Serjeant of London, and, on the death of Sir John William Rose in 1803 he was appointed Recorder of London, the senior judge at the Old Bailey. As Common Serjeant Silvester was regarded as \"uncouth and overly severe\". He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1780; in 1804 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and was appointed Steward of Southwark. Silvester was the Commissioner of the Court of Lieutenancy of the City of London. He was created a baronet on 27 December 1814, and was awarded the DCL of the University of Oxford in 1818. Silvester married twice, but had no children. On his death in 1822 his baronetcy passed to his nephew, Captain Philip Carteret Silvester, RN, CB. His body was taken from his home in Bloomsbury Square to be buried with his family at All Saints Church in Chingford in Essex. His bust was sculpted by Robert William Sievier and was displayed in the Old Baileybut later moved to the Mansion House. In the BBC One television series Garrow's Law he was played by Aidan McArdle."

  "text" : "John Charles Handy (October 20, 1844 – September 24, 1891) was a prominent physician who attacked his wife's divorce attorney and was killed. He practiced medicine from 1871 to 1891 in Tucson, Arizona Territory. He was first a contract surgeon for the U.S. Army at Camp Thomas and married an Apache woman. He became known for a fiery temper and during a disagreement with the post trader killed him, but was acquitted of all charges. Handy moved to Tucson in 1871 and remarried. He was selected in November 1886 as the first Chancellor of the University of Arizona and was a well-regarded physician. He founded the Pima County Medical Society in 1879 and helped set high standards for medical care. In 1884, he was among 58 Tucson pioneers who formed the Society of Arizona Pioneers. He severely abused his wife Mary Page, chaining her to a bed in their home for days and may have administered morphine to her until she was addicted. Two years later he was having an affair with a married woman and filed for divorce, accusing her of being \"a morphine fiend and a common slut.\" Handy publicly stated that any lawyer who defended her \"would be sorry\", and repeatedly threatened to kill her attorney Francis J. Heney. After he won the divorce trial and custody of their children, who he sent to live with his mother, he tried to evict Mary Page from the home the court had awarded her. In September 1891, he attacked Heney on the streets of Tucson and the attorney shot him in what was ruled as self-defense. Handy's good friend Dr. George E. Goodfellow, a nationally recognized expert in gunshot wounds, traveled 70 miles (110 km) to operate on Handy but was unable to save him, and Handy died the next day. Handy's son Jack was told by his paternal grandmother and aunt that Heney had attacked his father, but as an adult learned the truth from his maternal grandmother. Jack became friends with Heney and served as a pallbearer at his funeral."

  "text" : "Julius Huehn (January 12, 1904 – June 8, 1971), was an operatic bass-baritone. He sang over 200 performances with the Metropolitan Opera between 1935 and 1946. Huehn sang many Wagner roles, including Wotan in Das Rheingold and Die Walkure, Donner in Das Rheingold, the Wanderer in Siegfried, Gunther in Gotterdammerung, Wolfram von Eschenbach in Tannhauser, Amfortas in Parsifal, Kothner in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Kurwenal in Tristan und Isolde and Telramund in Lohengrin. Other operatic roles included Escamilio in Carmen, Faninal in Der Rosenkavalier, Orestes in Elektra, Jochanaan in Salome, Don Pizzaro and Don Fernando in Fidelio, Sharpless in Madama Butterfly and the High Priest in Samson et Delilah . Huehn's debut at the Metropolitan Opera was on December 21, 1935 as Telramund. He also sang the role of Robinson in the Met's premiere of Cimarosa's opera Il Matrimonio Segreto on February 25, 1937. He also performed at the San Francisco Opera, the Philadelphia Opera, the Chicago Grand Opera Company, the Rochester Oratorio Society, the Chautauqua Opera and the Worcester Music Festival. Huehn was born in 1904 in Revere, Massachusetts. He served as a ground control officer in the US Marine Corps during World War II after enlisting in 1944, holding the rank of captain. After his service in the military, he returned to the Metropolitan Opera for the 1946-47 season, but reports of the time indicate that his otherwise powerful baritone tone had all but faded. He spent the last 19 years of his life, from 1952 to 1971, teaching voice at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. His pupils included singers Philip Booth, John Glenn Paton, and Sylvia Stone. He died in Rochester on June 8, 1971."

He was born in Dallas in 1952 and received a MFA and a BFA from East Texas State University; he also attended the Empire State Studio Arts Program, New York. The artist is represented by Horton Gallery in New York. John Pomara is interested in the role human error plays in technology, and his paintings intend to capture that concept visually. His abstract paintings depict blurs, glitches, and printing imperfections, contradicting our vision of modern technology as cold, rational, and without error. Entropy and mechanical failure are prevalent themes within his work; in his endeavors to visually represent these errors he utilizes printers, copy machines and the Internet. Even the medium upon which he works is evocative of his underlying message, the industrial surfaces of the aluminum panels complimenting and enhancing his artistic vision. There are many who would argue that making mistakes is part of the creative process, and Pomara's work in part adheres to this sentiment, oftentimes inspired by the paint drips and spills that landed on the newspaper covering his studio floor. He currently teaches at University of Texas, Dallas."

  "text" : "Dr. J. Reid Shelton (January 16, 1911 – December 31, 2007) was a professor of chemistry at Case Western University in Cleveland, Ohio. He is known for his work on oxidation and antioxidants in rubber, and for his application of laser-Raman spectroscopy to the study of sulfur vulcanization. His research on synthetic rubber was particularly important during World War II, when access to natural rubber in Southeast Asia was cut off by the Japanese, and the new SR made from styrene and butadiene displayed stability problems. With his students, he undertook fundamental studies of the reactions occurring in the oxidation, degradation, and stabilization of rubber and other polymers with support at various times from Firestone, Goodyear, the U.S. Army Ordinance Research and other government agencies, and the Petroleum Research Fund. In 1983, Shelton received the ACS Rubber Division's Charles Goodyear Medal. Shelton mentored anotherCharles Goodyear Medalist: Jack L. Koenig. Koenig won the award in 2000. Shelton retired in 1977 after 41 years of teaching. He died Dec. 31, 2007 at the age of 96."

They fused \"mouse myeloma cells secreting immunoglobulin of known specificity and human peripheral blood lymphocytes not secreting detectable immunoglobulin. The hybrid cells continued secretion of mouse immunoglobulin and initiate synthesis and secretion of human immunoglobulin.\" The antibody producing cells did not survive long and the antigens that the antibodies targeted remained unknown. In 1975, Georges Köhler, César Milstein, and Niels Kaj Jerne, succeeded in making hybridomas that made antibodies to known antigens and that were immortalized. They shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984 for the discovery. His work in laying the foundation for modern monoclonal antibody technology is recognized."

  "text" : "Jeanne Belhomme (d. fl. 1745), was a French actress and theatre director. She was the director of the La Monnaie in Brussels from 1743 to 1745. She shared the position jointly with Charles Plante. Jeanne Belhomme was commonly known simply as \"Demoiselle Belhomme\". She was initially engaged as an actress at the La Monnaie. During the 1730s, she was listed with a salary of $800, which placed her among the elite of the actors of the theater. When the director Joseph Uriot resigned in 1743, she resumed the position of director and manager of the theater La Monnaie in partnership with her colleague, Charles Plante. This was an unstable period in the history of the theater, and few directors managed to handle the post very long. In 1745, Belhomme and Plante resigned their co-directorship to Nicolini."

  "text" : "Julie Katharina von Hausmann (born 7 March [O.S. 19 March] 1826 in Riga; died 2 August [O.S. 15 August] 1901 in Võsu, Estonia) was a Baltic German poet, known for the hymn Lord, Take My Hand and Lead Me (German: So nimm denn meine Hände) with a melody by Friedrich Silcher. Earlier translations had been made by Herman Brueckner as \"O take my hand, dear Father\" and Elmer Leon Jorgenson as \"Take Thou My Hand, and Lead Me.\" The hymn has also been translated by Martha D. Lange, whose version appears in the Great Songs of the Church Revised (1986). Julie Hausmann was the daughter of a teacher. She worked for a while as a governess, but due to her ill health she lived with and cared for her father, who had gone blind. After his death in 1864, she lived with her sisters in Germany, Southern France and St. Petersburg, Russia. She died during a summer vacation in Estonia. A legend circulates that Hausmann wrote her most famous poem \"So nimm denn meine Hände\" after journeying to see her fiancé at a mission and, on arriving, finding that he had just died. Various explorations of her biography have yet to confirm or deny the rumor. She never married. Her poetry was published by others, including Gustav Knak without mentioning her name, at her request."

  "text" : "Jane Martha St. John (née Hicks Beach, 1801–1882) was an early English photographer. She is remembered for her calotypes of Rome and other towns in Italy, now in the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. St. John made over 100 photographs in the late 1850s when travelling with her husband in Italy. Her introduction to photography probably resulted from the connections her privileged family enjoyed with John Dillwyn Llewelyn and the pioneering Talbots. St. John's work included portraits, travel views, and scenes of the grounds of houses. The photographs of the Hotel des Étrangers in Naples and the view of the waterfront are remarkable for the period. Unlike her contemporaries, she was interested above all in capturing the scenes of her travels but her images were also carefully composed. This is particularly evident in her photograph of the Roman Colosseum with the adjacent Arch of Constantine. Her individual approach to her work makes St. John one of the more interesting amateur photographers of the mid-19th century."

And his purchase of the tenancy linked to Albert Meltzer’s Wooden Shoe Press was the premise of the long dispute between Meltzer and Vernon Richards. He worked alongside Lilian Wolfe and Mary Canipa in the Freedom Bookshop. Jack contributed quite a lot of articles for Freedom and Anarchy, sometimes anonymously, during the 1970s. Though he is thought to have had a hand in editorial group through the 60's. At the request of Canipa his work was reproduced in Freedom: a hundred years put together by Donald Rooum, because by its publication date he had already died. Jack Robinson enjoyed active stints, alongside Rooum in the Colne and Nelson Anarchist Group and was a noted non-smoker, a teetotaler and a vegetarian."

His last book, Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice, was something of a departure from his usual writings, and its original publisher abandoned the finished manuscript shortly after Holland's death, which followed a brief struggle with cancer. However, the book was later published posthumously by a different publisher."

Although he may previously have worked in Segovia, and there was also a Juan de la Cuesta based in Alcalá de Henares in 1589 (although the latter may refer to another person), it was not until 1599 that he started working in Madrid, taken on as manager of the printing works owned by María Rodríguez de Rivalde, widow of the printers Juan Íñiguez de Lequerica and Pedro Madrigal. An inventory carried out of the premises in September 1595, just a few years before he was taken on to run the business for whom he later referred to as his mother-in-law, referred to six presses, and the year they started printing the Quixote, 1604, it had twenty employees. He married María de Quiñones in 1604, and in 1607 he left Madrid, abandoning his pregnant wife, who would, after her husband's death, take over the business and become an important printer in her own right. The old printshop, at No. 87 calle Atocha in Madrid, is now the headquarters of the Sociedad Cervantina, founded by Luis Astrana Marín in 1953, and was officially opened as a museum by the king and queen of Spain in 1987."

  "text" : "John Segrave, 4th Baron Segrave (4 May 1315 – 1 April 1353) was an English peer and landowner in Leicestershire and Yorkshire. His family title of Baron Segrave is drawn from a village now spelled Seagrave, which uses a coat of arms similar to that of the barons. Segrave was the son of Stephen Segrave, 3rd Baron Segrave, and Alice Fitzalan. Little is known of his early life. About 1335 Segrave married Margaret, daughter and eventual sole heir of Thomas of Brotherton, son of Edward I by his second marriage, by whom he had two sons and two daughters: \n* John de Segrave, who died young. \n* John de Segrave (d. before 1 April 1353), second of that name, who was contracted to marry Blanche of Lancaster, younger daughter and coheiress of Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster. However the contract was later declared void. About 1349 a double marriage was solemnized in which John Segrave married Blanche Mowbray, while John's sister, Elizabeth Segrave, married Blanche Mowbray's brother, John de Mowbray, 4th Baron Mowbray, Pope Clement VI having granted dispensations for the marriages at the request of Lancaster, in order to prevent 'disputes between the parents', who were neighbours. \n* Elizabeth de Segrave, 5th Baroness Segrave, who married John de Mowbray, 4th Baron Mowbray. \n* Margaret de Segrave, who died young, before 1353. A year after the marriage his wife inherited her father's title and estates, becoming in her own right Countess of Norfolk and Earl Marshal of England. In 1350, Segrave and his wife sought a divorce, arguing that they had been contracted in marriage before Margaret was of age, and that she had never consented. The impetus for this was that Margaret wished to marry Walter Manny, 1st Baron Manny, with whom she was implicated. However, Segrave died at Bretby in Repton, Derbyshire on 1 April 1353, before the divorce had been granted. He was succeeded in the barony by his daughter Elizabeth."

He was first elected in a by-election on August 12, 1991, following Séguin's resignation, and was reelected in the 1994 election. He left the party to sit as an independent in 1995, and ran unsuccessfully for the mayoralty of Beauport in 1996. He ran as an independent candidate in the 1998 election, but was defeated by Jean-François Simard. He was later charged with thirteen counts of fraud and breach of trust, after allegations that he diverted funds from his MNA expense budget into renovations for a building he owned. He was convicted in 2004 on eight of the thirteen counts, and sentenced to six months in jail. He was subsequently stripped of his designation as a chartered accountant by the Quebec Order of Chartered Accountants. Due to his conviction, the National Assembly withheld a sizable \"transition payment\" that he would have been entitled to as an outgoing MNA. He filed a lawsuit against the provincial government in the Quebec Superior Court in 2012 for $52,617 in transition payments, $50,000 in moral damages and $42,000 to cover legal fees and expenses. In February 2013, Superior Court Justice Suzanne Hardy-Lemieux ruled that he was entitled to partial compensation of $29,699 for the transition payments, but rejected his claim for additional damages and expenses."

  "text" : "Jakov of Serres (Serbian: Јаков Серски; 1300–1365) was a medieval Serbian writer, scholar, translator, and hierarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, one of the most important men of letters working in the 14th century. Evidence about his life is scarce but his literary legacy suggests an excellent knowledge of Greek and Slavic languages. In 1343, King and eventually Emperor, Stefan Dušan began to build the Monastery of the Holy Archangels near Prizren; and he appointed Jakov, a learned and highly esteemed monk, its first hegumen (abbot). Both Stefan Dušan and his wife Jelena were in awe of Jakov's wide knowledge and they often sought his company and counsel. In 1345, Stefan Dušan captured the city of Serres from the Byzantine Empire; and Jakov was appointed Metropolitan of Serres and its surrounding territories. The population of Serres was mixed Slavic, Albanian and Greek and Jakov was fluent in all three languages and their dialects. In fact, Jakov wrote some literature hymns in Greek, and is numbered among the Greek authors as well as Serbian. After the sudden death of Stefan Dušan in 1355, Jelena, Dušan's wife, became a nun, took the name Jelisaveta, and moved from Skoplje, the capital of Serbia, to Serres. From there, she administered her estates; and Jakov was at her side as wise counsel. Jakov wrote the Triodion which he sent as his bequest to the Monastery of the Theotokos in Sinai in 1359 or 1360. At present, the Triodion (a two-part Triodion, one for Lent and the other for the period between Easter and Pentecost) is kept in Monastery of St. Catherine in Sinai. Copies are also kept at Hilandar Monastery, Mount Athos, Greece, and in libraries in the United Kingdom, Europe and North America. He is illustrated in the Serbian manuscript of Kalist's Tetraevangelion (The Four Gospels) dating to 1354, held at the British Museum."

  "text" : "Julian Clifford Holmes (November 20, 1930 – December 16, 2012) was an American physicist, rocket scientist, inventor, political activist and environmental gadfly. Holmes was born in Portland, Maine. The son of mathematics teachers Cecil T. and Marion C. Holmes, he studied physics at Bowdoin College, from which he was hired in 1951 by the Rocketry Division of the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, D.C, where he spent his entire career, retiring as a GS 14 Government physicist on December 30, 1985. At NRL, Holmes’ career evolved with the Cold War. He developed countermeasure sensors for detecting distant nuclear events, and designed aeronomy instrumentation for the Navy's Aerobee class of scientific rockets during the Navy's technological transition from cathode ray tube electronics to solid-state electronics. He also developed formulas for interpreting data captured by these rockets' returning payloads, bringing a better understanding of the nature of the earth's ionosphere, and of the effects of solar fluxes and manmade chemicals on it. In the course of his work, Holmes was awarded six patents for inventions relating to electronic countermeasures, development of instrumentation for the Aerobee rocket series, and for interpretation of data from Aerobee and other rockets. In addition to his scientific and engineering achievements, Holmes was a citizen activist, stimulating reforms in rural Maryland county zoning laws in the 1960s and 1970s. Holmes used Grand juries to investigate corruption in the 1980s. In 1993 Holmes returned to Maine with companion Audrey Marra. There he helped enact a ban on the sale of controversial gasoline additive MTBE in that state. He became an advocate for forestry reform and island conservation, playing a key role in the rejection of an industrial port on pristine Sears Island in Penobscot Bay. Holmes died in Lewiston, Maine on December 16, 2012."

  "text" : "Jack Swart (born 1954) is a former New Zealand road cyclist. In the 1978 Commonwealth Games he competed in the 4000m team pursuit, coming 2nd for silver; and the 4000m individual pursuit. . In the 1982 Commonwealth Games he competed in the Team time trial, coming 3rd for bronze; and the Road Race, coming 15th. He was not chosen for the 1984 Summer Olympics despite a world-class performance in the Coors International in Colorado, the selectors apparently regarded him as a tour rider not an individual racer despite having won two New Zealand road championships. He was described as \"the blond-haired giant of New Zealand cycling for the best part of a decade through to 1986\". Swart and Blair Stockwell were the only two riders to win the \"Dulux North Island Tour\" three times. He was born in Tuakau to a dairy farmer from the Netherlands; his younger brother Stephen Swart was also a champion road cyclist."

He was named Master of the Works of Lyon Cathedral in 1418 and was contracted to execute an elaborate tomb for a cardinal there in 1420 (destroyed 1562). After leaving Lyon in 1424 or 1425, Morel worked in the Rhone valley and elsewhere in southern and central France. He is cited as an inhabitant of Toulouse in a commission for a silver altarpiece for Avignon Cathedral (1429; apparently never completed), as active in Béziers (1433; work for Saint Aphrodise, and as collaborator of Simon de Beaujeu in Tarascon (c. 1433). This was followed by periods of residence in Avignon (1441-5), Montpellier (1445-8) and Rodez, where in 1448 he received a contract for the construction and sculptural decoration of the south portal of the cathedral (work left incomplete in 1456). In 1448 he was commissioned to carve the alabaster tomb of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon (d 1456), and his wife Agnes of Burgundy, Duchess of Bourbon, for the Chapelle Neuve of St. Pierre, Souvigny. Completed in 1453, this is his only documented work to survive. Morel spent his last years from 1453 in Angers, where he completed the tomb of King René of Anjou (d 1480) and his first wife Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine (d 1453), in Angers Cathedral (begun 1450 by Jean Pocet (d 1452) and his son; destroyed)."

Born in Ireland, the son of John Jameson of Anfield, County Dublin, he was educated at Sandhurst. He served in the 18th Regiment of Foot, the 20th Hussars, and the Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars. In 1914, he raised the 24th (County of London) Battalion, of the London Regiment (The Queen's), and served in Dublin and Flanders. He served as HM Inspector of Factories and was managing director of William Jameson distillers, Dublin. From 1895 until 1906 he served as member of parliament for West Clare. Elected as a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he took an independent line in the 1900s and in 1904 he transferred his support to the Conservative Party. He did not contest the 1906 general election. He married Mary Cabbell of Cromer, and died in 1919 at his residence in Ealing, London."

Composers using this hymn included Dietrich Buxtehude (BuxW 20 and 21) and Johann Sebastian Bach, who based a chorale cantata on it, Du Friedefürst, Herr Jesu Christ, and used it in several other cantatas."

In general, I share this consensus, while stipulating that nations, but no particular nation of the modern type, and certainly not nationalism existed before the 16th century. Such issues of timing and agency are very important to my theory, for my methodological preference is for intensive employment of historical data over the longue durée ... The pre-modern social formations that I treat in Nations before Nationalism  and elsewhere ... require a national idea. Fundamental themes are myth, symbol, and communication, especially as they relate to boundary mechanisms of a psychological rather than territorial nature.\"" ],

  "text" : "John Alexander Armstrong Jr. (1922–2010) was Professor Emeritus of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Born in St. Augustine, Florida on 4 May 1922, he entered the University of Chicago at age 20 where he received both bachelor and master's degrees. However, the date of his graduation was delayed by his enlistment in the U.S. Army in Belgium during WWII, from 1944 to 1945. Such experience appears to have certain impacts upon the direction of his academic research on nationalism in Europe afterwards. He entered Columbia University for further study in 1950 and received a Ph.D three years later. His earlier works focus on nationalism and ideologies in Europe, especially Ukraine and Russia during the 1950s and 1960s. The most influential work of his is the path-breaking Nations before Nationalism (1982) which firstly systematically expressed the longue durée of ethnic identity and has inspired theorists of ethnosymbolism including Anthony D. Smith."

  "text" : "Jacques Patin (died 28 May 1587) was a French painter, decorator, illustrator and engraver. Although the date and place of Patin's birth are unknown, he was part of a family of artists that included his father and brothers. He married Marguerite Pennichot in 1555, when he had already established a passable reputation. In 1559 he was hired along with François Clouet and Guyon Ledoux to make armorial bearings for the funeral of Henry II, and in 1564, by Constable Anne de Montmorency to work at the Château d'Écouen, although there is no evidence that he was given any important projects there. However, in 1567 he produced decorations for the Louvre under the supervision of Pierre Lescot and in 1570 was retained by the Grand Equerry Claude Gouffier to provide decorations for the Hôtel de Boissy. In 1581 Patin designed the sets and costumes for the first ballet de cour, the Balet comique de la Royne, which was performed as part of the celebrations surrounding the marriage of the Duc de Joyeuse to Marguerite de Vaudémont, sister of Henry III's queen, Louise de Lorraine. In 1582 Patin was officially made peintre du Roy (painter to the King), and, at the request of the queen, he drew and engraved 27 plates for the well-known book which was published by the creator of the ballet, Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx, to document the performance. Patin probably died in Paris."

It is not present in human, rat, rabbit, porcine or bovine cells. His name is also associated with the following two terms: \"Forssman antibody\" (heterophile antibody) and \"Forssman reaction\", also referred to as a \"Forssman antigen-antibody reaction\"."

Dial was elected to the the Arizona House of Representatives in 2010 and was reelected in 2012. Dial was elected to the Arizona Senate representing the 18th district in 2014. In 2015, the Arizona Republic reported that Dial had made an eight-year commitment to the United States Army Reserve in 1996, but Dial said he received a honorably discharge due to his weight in 2004. In 2016, Dial's reelection was challenged by Republican candidate Frank Schmuck, police chief of Chandler, Arizona. Schmuck portrayed himself as a conservative running against a moderate. Schmuck also persistently questioned Dial's military record, asking whether Dial really earned the \"Army veteran\" status that Dial claimed in his campaign materials. On August 30, 2016, Schmuck defeated Dial in the Republican primary election, receiving 53.4% of the vote. Following the primary election, Dial endorsed Schmuck in the general election against Democratic candidate Sean Bowie and Green candidate Linda Macias, both of whom ran uncontested in their parties' primary elections."

He was a member of London County Council before being elected Conservative Member of Parliament for East Down at a by-election in 1890. He remained as member for the constituency until resigning in 1902, after he was in November 1901 appointed a Judge of the City of London Court and the Central Criminal Court. According to The Times, Judge Rentoul was 'patient and kind in the performance of his duties, but it would be useless to pretend that he was a success on the Bench'. On a number of occasions his decisions were severely criticised by the Court of Criminal Appeal, one being described as 'unusual and extraordinary'. He resigned shortly before his death. He was described as a 'kindly and loving man' and a brilliant after-dinner speaker. In Who's Who, he listed his only recreation as 'Reading Who’s Who'. He died in London in 1919. His son, Gervais Rentoul, became Member of Parliament for Lowestoft."

Murray lived in Charlotte, North Carolina and worked for Bank of America. She occasionally skydived before her accident. On September 25, 1999, she went on a skydive from 14,500 feet. Her main parachute could not open, and although her backup parachute opened at 700 feet, it quickly deflated. She approached the ground at 80 miles per hour (128 kilometers per hour), landing on a mound of fire ants. Doctors believe that the shock of being stung over 200 times by the ants released a surge of adrenaline which kept her heart beating. Murray suffered serious injuries, shattering the right side of her body and knocking fillings out of her teeth. She went into a coma for two weeks at Carolinas Medical Center, but survived after 20 reconstructive surgeries and 17 blood transfusions. She continued work at Bank of America after the accident, turning down retirement because of disability. She took physical therapy sessions and went on a 37th skydive in 2001."

He specialized in designing miniature models resembling film stars, which were then photographed against backgrounds giving a three-dimensional effect. Although Kapralik's work occasionally appeared onscreen in films such as Presenting Lily Mars, most of his output was devoted to publicity materials in trade magazine ads and press kits. Kapralik died in 1960, in Los Angeles, California."

  "text" : "James De Ville (12 March 1777, Hammersmith — 6 May 1846 in London) was a British phrenologist. His grandfather was from Bern, Switzerland but emigrated to England along with other Protestants perhaps in the 1740s. De Ville's mother and maternal grandmother were English. Because his family fell into hard times De Ville was raised from the age of eight by a maternal uncle who had a brickmaking business in Hammersmith. De Ville was the most prominent practical phrenologist, supplier and maker of phrenological casts in London from the 1820s to the 1840s. By 1826 Johann Spurzheim declared that De Ville's collection was the finest he had ever seen. Franz Joseph Gall himself also highly valued De Ville's work and sent a wax mould of a dissected brain as a token of respect. De Ville's casts were distributed throughout the world and many still survive in the collection of the Edinburgh School of Anatomy. In 1840 he became a member of the Phrenological Association and resigned in 1842 upon the occasion of the great split among British phrenologists when William Collins Engledue (1813–1858), in a speech before the Association, announced that phrenology and materialism were the same. De Ville examined an enormous number of heads including those of many well-known figures including John Elliotson, Hermann Prince of Pückler-Muskau, William de Salis, Harriet Martineau, Charles Bray, George Eliot, William Blake, Richard Dale Owen, Richard Carlile, the Duke of Wellington and Prince Albert."

He was trained as a medical doctor and, on August 26, 1871, he was appointed as an Associate Coroner for the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville. He was married in Appleton, Ontario, on July 6, 1864, to Caroline (Carrie) Teskey (1840–1924) of Ramsay Township and they had one daughter. Giles was elected in a by-election called when Herbert Stone MacDonald, the sitting Conservative MPP resigned to become a Judge. Giles served for only one year and his Legislative Service included membership on only one Standing Committee (Private Bills). In 1874, he was defeated for the Conservative nomination by Robert Henry Preston who went on to win in the general election held that year. He died in Leeds County, Ontario, in 1903."

  "text" : "James M. Massie  (October 20, 1833 – May 1, 1904) was an Ontario businessman and political figure. He represented Wellington South in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal member from 1876 to 1879. Massie was born to James Massie and Elizabeth Ann Masson in Lumphannan, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. On September 23, 1862, he married Mary Ann Armstrong, in Guelph, Ontario. Together they had two children: Jessie Marion Massie (1866–1929) and Robert Frank Massie (1877–1935). Massie was elected in a by-election called when Peter Gow, the sitting Liberal MPP resigned to accept the Shrievalty of Wellington (i.e. he became the County Sheriff). As had been the case with his predecessor, the Conservative Party chose not to run a candidate against Massie and he was acclaimed. Massie had been active in the Reform Party, as the provincial Liberal Party was then called, since the early 1870s. He served for only one year and his Legislative Service included membership on as many as four Standing Committees, simultaneously. In 1879, he left politics to accept an appointment as the Warden of the Central Prison, in Toronto. In 1885, the provincial government appointed a royal commission investigating charges of “cruelty, partiality and mismanagement” against Massie, in his capacity as the warden of Central Prison.Despite incredible latitude given to prisoners and ex-prisoners to recount any complaints against Massie, in particular, or the prison, in general, the Commission determined there were no grounds for any complaints against Massie and, if anything, he was deemed to be too lenient. There was a second Commission created, in 1890, to chair a commission on the prison and reformatory system of Ontario. Massie's testimony featured prominently in the enquiry. He was active in a variety of businesses in and around Guelph, Ontario. He was a partner with Guelph merchant Christopher Campbell in the firm “Massie and Campbell”, manufacturers of wholesale biscuits and confectioneries. In 1870, he was elected as one of the first Directors of the Guelph Gas Company, a business established to produce and distribute natural gas in the town. He was an active member of St. Andrews Presbyterian Church, in Guelph, and the St. Andrews Society. As a hobby, he was an award-winning breeder of pigeons. On July 21, 1891, he was elected as one of the founding Directors of the Children's Aid Society and Fresh Air Fund, in Toronto. Massie died in Toronto on May 1, 1904."

  "text" : "Julien BriseBois (born January 24, 1977) is a Canadian ice hockey executive. He is currently the General Manager of the Syracuse Crunch in the American Hockey League (AHL), and the Assistant General Manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning in the National Hockey League (NHL). He reports directly to Lightning vice president and general manager Steve Yzerman and assists him in all aspects of player personnel decisions, analytics, contract preparation and negotiation, as well as salary arbitration for the Lightning and the Syracuse Crunch of the American Hockey League, for whom he also serves as general manager. BriseBois also manages interpretation of the NHL’s collective bargaining agreement and the salary cap for Tampa Bay. As general manager of the Lightning’s top affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch, BriseBois has been the architect of teams that reached the Calder Cup Finals in two of the previous three seasons, including winning the championship in 2012. With the Lightning’s emphasis on drafting and development, the Crunch play an integral role in Tampa Bay’s success. During BriseBois’ tenure overseeing the Lightning’s top minor league affiliate, they have produced two AHL most valuable players, a defenseman of the year and have graduated numerous key players including 2013-2014 Calder Trophy Finalists Tyler Johnson and Ondrej Palat as well as head coach Jon Cooper. During the 2011-2012 season, BriseBois’ Norfolk Admirals set a professional sports record with a 28-game winning streak that propelled Norfolk to the AHL’s best regular season record. The team’s regular season success continued in the playoffs as the Admirals went on to win the organization’s first Calder Cup, the first championship by a Lightning AHL affiliate. BriseBois was instrumental in helping build the organization’s depth with signings that proved instrumental to both the Lightning and the Admirals, demonstrated by nine players being recalled to Tampa Bay during the season. In 2010-2011 the Hockey News recognized BriseBois as the top hockey executive under 40 years of age in their annual “Top 40 Under 40” listing. Prior to coming to Tampa Bay, BriseBois spent nine seasons with the Montreal Canadiens after joining the organization on September 1, 2001 as director of legal affairs. In July of 2003 he added director of hockey operations to his duties before being named vice president of hockey operations on July 24, 2006. In this capacity, BriseBois oversaw the Canadiens’ AHL affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs. The Bulldogs went on to win the 2007 Calder Cup during the first season under BriseBois’ direction. On August 23, 2007 BriseBois was named the general manager of the Hamilton Bulldogs, making him the youngest in the AHL at the time. As an American Hockey League general manager, BriseBois has hired two head coaches that have won the Louis A.R. Pieri Award as the AHL’s outstanding coach of the year (Guy Boucher – Hamilton Bulldogs 2009-2010; Jon Cooper – Norfolk Admirals 2011-2012). A native of Greenfield Park, Quebec, BriseBois was employed by the Heenan Blaikie law firm before joining the Canadiens. During that time he worked in the field of sports law, where he represented several NHL and Major League Baseball clubs in arbitration cases as well as acting as an advisor in contract negotiations. BriseBois also participated in the reform of the Constitution and By-Laws of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. BriseBois is a graduate of the University of Montreal Faculty of Law and earned a Master’s degree in business administration from the John Molson School of Business at Concordia University. He is a member of the Quebec Bar, the American Bar Association and the Sports Lawyers Association. At various points, he has been a member of the AHL’s Competition Committee, the AHL’s Player Development Committee and the AHL’s CBA Committee. In 2013, BriseBois won the John Molson School of Business “MBA Alumnus of the Year” award."

  "text" : "Joe Pullen (c. 1883 - December 15, 1923) was an African-American tenant farmer who was murdered by a lynch mob of local white citizens near Drew, Mississippi on December 15, 1923. While the circumstances that precipitated the violence were typical for that place and time, Pullen's case is unusual in that he managed to kill at least three members of the lynch mob and wound several others before ultimately perishing himself. Because of his courage, Pullen became a folk hero and his bravery was championed by the Universal Negro Improvement Association. While the incident received only brief national news coverage, the local repercussions were far more profound. As civil rights leader Fanny Lou Hamer recalled in an autobiographical essay on growing up in a nearby Mississippi town: \"it was a while in Mississippi before the whites tried something like that again.\""

In 1842 he moved to Weimar, later writing the standard work on fly fishing, entitled The art of fly fishing for trout and grayling in Germany and Austria. It was first published in 1874 and describes the state of fishing as a sport in England, the decline of fisheries due to over-fishing and the inadequacy of the existing fishing laws - it also calls for the abolition of medieval customs and outdated fishing methods and the introduction of laws to protect fish stocks. He married three times and after his move to Weimar he was widowed twice. His first wife was Caroline Hahn (died 1847), his second Isabella Zwierlein (1825-1853) and his third Maura Diehme. He died and is buried at Weimar."

  "text" : "John Whipple Dwinelle (September 9, 1816 – January 28, 1881) was an American lawyer and politician. He served in a number of political posts in California and played important roles in both the legal history of San Francisco and the establishment of the California public university system. Dwinelle was born in Cazenovia, New York, the son of Congressman Justin Dwinell and Louise Whipple, a descendant of William Whipple. He graduated from Hamilton College in 1834. While studying law, he edited the New York Daily Gazette, the Daily Buffalonian, and edited and typeset the Rochester Daily Advertiser. Dwinelle was admitted to the bar in October 1837 and began a legal practice in Rochester, New York. In 1844 he was elected city attorney of Rochester. The next year he became master of chancery. In 1849, he sailed to San Francisco, California, and began a legal practice there. He served in a number of government offices, including two terms on the San Francisco city council, Mayor of Oakland, California, and member of the California State Assembly from Alameda County, California. Dwinelle represented the city of San Francisco in the so-called \"pueblo case\", Hart v. Burnett, which secured San Francisco's claim to four square leagues of land due to the city's establishment as the pueblo of Yerba Buena under Mexican rule. Dwinelle's lengthy brief on these matters of land usage and history were published as The Colonial History of San Francisco (1863). Dwinelle was also the lawyer in an important court case regarding school segregation. In Ward v. Flood (1874), he represented a black child who was refused enrollment at a San Francisco school. The Supreme Court of California ruled that black students could not be refused education under the Fourteenth Amendment, but that they could be denied entry into specific schools on the basis of race. This upheld the legal principle of \"separate but equal\" many years before the legal doctrine was adopted by the United States Supreme Court in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). While this ruling did not desegregate California schools, it did guarantee the right of black students to an education. As an Assemblyman, Dwinelle wrote and introduced the 1868 Organic Act establishing the University of California. Dwinelle became one of the first Regents of the University of California. Dwinelle Hall at University of California, Berkeley, the first campus opened as a result of Dwinelle's bill, is named for him. While trying to catch a ferry, Dwinelle fell from a pier in Port Costa, California, and drowned. His body washed ashore three weeks later."

  "text" : "John Vaughan (15 January 1756 – 30 December 1841) was a wine merchant, philanthropist, and long-time treasurer and librarian of the American Philosophical Society. A native of England, Vaughan settled in Philadelphia in 1782, becoming a respected member of the city, working tirelessly for many literary, scientific and benevolent causes. During five decades of service to the Society, Vaughan was instrumental in building its library collection and introducing many scientists and historians to each other through his letters and Sunday breakfasts. John Vaughan was born in London on 15 January 1756, one of ten surviving children of Samuel Frier Vaughan, a London merchant banker and West India planter, and Sarah Hallowell, daughter of Benjamin Hallowell, a Boston merchant and founder of Hallowell, Maine. The family were liberals who attended the Presbyterian, later Unitarian, Gravel Pit Chapel, Hackney, where the dissenting minister and political radical Richard Price preached. As with his four brothers Benjamin Vaughan, Vaughan attended Warrington Academy, 1772-1774. In preparation for a mercantile career, John Vaughan was sent abroad, first to Jamaica (1776), and then to France (1778), where he worked for a merchant house in Bordeaux, and met Benjamin Franklin. In 1778, following the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, Vaughan, who, as a British subject, was faced with possible arrest or deportation, declared himself an American. However, he was unable to procure a certificate to that effect, and resided in Spain for a while before removing to the United States in 1782. Vaughan settled in Philadelphia, where he became a prosperous wine merchant, with warehouse and offices at 109 & 111, South Front Street, in the commercial quarter. Vaughan became a member of the American Philosophical Society, 16 January 1784, and subsequently dedicated much of his energy and resources to the Society. He became a member, 16 January 1784, its treasurer in 1791, and librarian in 1803, serving in these posts until his death. Vaughan kept the society's books and accounts, and oversaw its publications. In 1824 he compiled a catalogue for the library which he hoped would one day become a national library. In 1795, he subscribed towards the proposed western expedition of the French botanist André Michaux. Though not a scholar himself, Vaughan encouraged and supported the work of scholars, especially those interested in Native American linguistics and ethno-history. Vaughan contributed generously to the construction of Philosophical Hall, in which he established his offices, whose cellars he rented for the storage of his wines and spirits, and where, from 1822, he set up home in rooms formerly occupied by the studio and gallery of the painter Thomas Sully, who, the following year, painted Vaughan’s portrait. Vaughan was distinguished for his philanthropic activities, serving as President of the Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind; President of the Society of the Sons of St George; a Director of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts; Vice-president of the Athenaeum of Philadelphia, a Trustee of the Unitarian Society; and a Councillor of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Furthermore, he was Secretary and Treasurer of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce; a Director of the Insurance Company of North America and of the Delaware Insurance Company of Philadelphia; and an Agent of the firm of E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company. He was an active member of the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia, where he occasionally occupied the pulpit. John Vaughan, who never married, died in his rooms in Philosophical Hall. The beneficiaries of his bequest included his friend Jacob Snider, who had been brought up by Vaughan, as well as various learned and philanthropic societies. Vaughan’s fifty years of service to the American Philosophical Society were overshadowed by the discovery after his death that he had mingled the Society's funds with his own, though there was no suggestion that he was the gainer thereby, or the Society the loser."

  "text" : "Dimara was born in Korem, North Biak, Papua on 9 October 1916. He graduated from basic training at Ambon in 1935. He then entered the School of Agriculture at the Laha in 1940. He then entered the School of Education Gospel. After graduation, he became a gospel teacher in Buru Island. In 1946, he participated in the Red and White flag hoisting in Namlea, Buru island. He helped fight for the return of territory of West Papua into the hands of the Indonesian Republic. In 1950, he was appointed Chairman of OPI (Liberation Organization West Papua). He was a member of TNI and infiltration in 1954 that led to his arrest by the army of the Dutch Kingdom. He was thrown into Digul until akhhinya released in 1960. When President Sukarno proclaimed Operation TRIKORA, he and Bung Karno became figures of the young people of Papua and they were invited to TRIKORA in Yogyakarta. He also called on the entire community in West Papua to participate in order to support the union territory West Papua in the lap of the Unitary State of Indonesian Republic. In 1962, the New York Agreement was held. He became a part of the delegation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia. The content of the agreement ultimately required the Dutch Kingdom to be willing to surrender West Papua to the government of Indonesian Republic. So, starting from that point, West Papua entered into the Unitary State of the Indonesian Republic. On August 17, a rally formed in front of the palace (that time there being no Monas) and Dimara, wearing chains, was severed. Bung Karno saw it and was inspired to make a statue of the liberation of West Irian. Thus, the statue was made in the liberation of West Irian only location is less than 1.5 km from the Palace of the country, namely in Banteng. Dimara's story was told in a book written by Carmelia Sukmawati called Fai Do Ma, Mai Do Fa, Son Struggle Across Papua, JA Dimara (2000)."

  "text" : "Jokichi Ikarashi (五十嵐 丈吉 Ikarashi Jōkichi, January 26, 1902 – July 23, 2013) was a Japanese supercentenarian who was thought to be the world's oldest verified living man after the death of 111-year-old James McCoubrey on July 5, 2013, until he died 18 days later of pneumonia at the age of 111 years, 178 days. However it was subsequently determined that Salustiano Sanchez (who died 52 days after Ikarashi), was born before Ikarashi and therefore he was the oldest living man. As stated by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Ikarashi was the oldest living man in Japan upon the death of 116-year-old Jiroemon Kimura on June 12, 2013. Ikarashi worked as a farmer before his retirement. He had stated his desire to become a centenarian for many years, and he joked that he \"forgot to die\" on his 110th birthday. Ikarashi had four children, eleven grandchildren, twenty-two great-grandchildren, and one great-great grandchild. He never had any serious injuries or illnesses other than a fall from a tree that broke his left foot at age ninety-one. Ikarashi enjoyed singing, ate three meals a day, and avoided alcohol and tobacco (which he credited for his longevity). Ikarashi was reported to be spending most of his time in bed in June 2013. At the time of his death, Ikarashi lived in a nursing home in Sanjo, Niigata. Ikarashi was succeeded as Japan's oldest living man by 110-year-old Sakari Momoi."

His work after that was in collodion. It is said, he had \"a complex character, Penrice eventually became a justice of the peace in Norfolk. In 1844, on the death of his father, he sent twenty-five major paintings from Wilton House, the family home near Yarmouth in Norfolk, to Messrs Christie and Manson. Some of these are in the National Gallery, London, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In 1861 he published The Valley of the Nile, a series of one hundred stereoscopic views taken in Egypt and Nubia. Although Penrice’s photographs are now virtually unknown, his Dictionary and Glossary of the Koran first published in 1873 is a substantial piece of scholarship\". Penrice served in Egypt and Nubia with British troops, his Dictionary and Glossary of the Koran is supposed to be an authoritative work of its kind. In the past 150 years multiple editions of the lexicon have been published."

  "text" : "Jupiter Bokondji (born 1965) is a musician from Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. He and his band, Okwess International, released their first album, Hotel Univers, in May 2013 in the United Kingdom. The band was created in 1990, and they toured the African continent. However, at the same time that their popularity grew, a civil war broke out in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some band members fled to Europe to escape violence, but Jupiter stayed in Kinshasa. As the war died down, his popularity grew again, and in 2006 he was featured in the documentary Jupiter's Dance. This brought him to the attention of U.K. producers and musicians, which led to him joining the African Express tour, the production of Hotel Univers, and performing at the 2013 Glastonbury Festival. Jupiter's sound is a unique combination of Afropop, traditional Congolese rhythms, funk, and rock music. He calls this distinct sound \"Bofenia Rock.\" His lyrics often carry political or social messages, including criticisms of the DRC government as well as positive encouragement for Africans to better realise their individual talent and potential."

Their mother, Margaret, was the daughter of Andrew Little, a farmer from Berwickshire. An elder brother died in infancy. Seth was born in Edinburgh and attended George Watsons College. He was a student of Alexander Campbell Fraser and Henry Calderwood, and won two scholarships. He then went on to Divinity and ordination via a theology degree at New College, Edinburgh. In 1898, he took the Chair of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh which he occupied for 26 years. During most of this time, the corresponding Chair of Logic and Metaphysics was occupied by his brother Andrew Seth Pringle - Pattison. James's inaugural lecture on ‘The Scottish Contribution to Moral Philosophy’ was subsequently published in The Philosophical Review, the journal he had edited. Seth was an active campaigner on temperance and education. He died in July 1925."

Lord Lisle's correspondence was seized by the state when he was arrested in May 1540 for treason and heresy, and as a result 515 letters written by Husee between 1533 and 1540 to Lord and Lady Lisle survive, mainly now preserved amongst the State Papers held at the National Archives. They were transcribed into modern English and in 1981 published, together with all the other Lisle Papers, by Muriel St Clare Byrne in her six-volume work \"The Lisle Letters\"."

After a brief stint in London, he moved to New York in 1904, and continued collecting folklore among the Yiddish-speaking Jews of New York. In 1925, Cahan helped organize the American branch of the YIVO, and was selected to lead its Folklore Committee. He was instrumental in expanding the folklore collection efforts of YIVO, and in 1930 returned to Vilna to train young scholars. After his death, YIVO planned to publish all of his works (collections of folk songs and folktales, and theoretical works), but only the folktales volume was published before the remaining material was destroyed during World War Two."

He prematurely retired from teaching in 1861 due to problems with eyesight. With Otto Sendtner (1813–1859), a professor of botany at the University of Munich, he participated in scientific excursions in the vicinity of Augsburg and throughout the mountains of Allgäu. Caflisch's botanical research included studies on the effects that climate, altitude and soil conditions had upon the geographical distribution of plants. He was a founding member of the Naturhistorischen Vereins in Augsburg (Natural History Society in Augsburg) and until his death in 1882, was in charge of the botanical collections at the Museum of Natural Sciences in Augsburg."

  "text" : "Julio Mairini Linares Rijo (born December 26, 1941) is the special advisor, Latin American player development, for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball and a former player, coach, scout, and manager in the professional ranks. Born in San Pedro de Macorís in the Dominican Republic, Linares spent most of his uniformed career at the minor league level; however, he served in the Majors for three seasons (1994–96) as an Astros' coach. As a player, Linares was a 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m), 165 lb (75 kg) second baseman and shortstop who threw and batted right-handed. He first played professional baseball at age 15 in 1957, when he appeared in two games with the Tucson Cowboys of the Class C Arizona–Texas League. He was on the roster of the Salinas Packers of the Class C California League in 1958, but did not play. He then spent 1959 out of baseball until he signed with the San Francisco Giants' organization in 1960, where he played 13 seasons, including four at the Triple-A level, but was never summoned to the Majors. After his retirement as a player following the 1972 season, Linares joined the Astros as a minor-league coach, manager and instructor. He managed at the Rookie-league level for 13 years (1976–79; 1985–86; 1989–93; 1997–98) with the Covington Astros and the Gulf Coast Astros, scouted in 1987–88, and also served as a roving infield instructor in the Astro farm system. In 1994, he was promoted to serve as a coach on the Major League staff of Houston manager Terry Collins, and stayed through 1996 before returning to the helm of the GCL Astros. From 1999 through 2004, he worked as the Astros' director of operations in the Dominican Republic, before his promotion to assistant to the general manager/Dominican Operations in 2005. His son Rodney has been the manager of the Corpus Christi Hooks, Houston's Double-A affiliate in the Texas League, since 2015."

The design of Plersch's sculptures refers to some extent to the so-called \"School of Lviv\" in sculpture. A symbolic tombstone of Governor Jan Tarło in the church portal of the Jesuit Church, Warsaw (destroyed during World War II, merged and reconstructed in 2010) is comparable to the best achievements of the 18th century European sculpture, both in terms of content and execution. Other important works by Plersch include the Marriage of Maria and the pulpit for the Carmelite Church, Warsaw, and sculpture from the upper floor of the facade of the Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Warsaw, renovated in 2009. That included Elizabeth and Mary from the scene of the Visitation and Saint Joseph, Saint Joachim and Saint Anne, and Zechariah. He also produced some works for the Holy Cross Church, Warsaw and St. Martin's Church, Warsaw. His son Jan Bogumil Plersch was a portrait painter and decorator at the court of King Stanisław August Poniatowski."

  "text" : "Joshua Soule Zimmerman (January 16, 1874 – September 2, 1962) was an American lawyer, politician, and orchardist in the U.S. state of West Virginia. In the early years of the 20th century, Zimmerman served as the Prosecuting Attorney for Hampshire County and as a Democratic member of the West Virginia House of Delegates. Zimmerman was born in La Plata to Reverend George Henry Zimmerman, a Methodist pastor and church administrator. He began his post-secondary education at Roanoke College and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Randolph–Macon College in 1892. He worked as a clerk in the United States Census Office in Washington, D.C., and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1896 from Columbian University Law School. Following his graduation, Zimmerman opened a law office in Romney, West Virginia, in July 1896 and engaged in the practice of law there. He provided legal services to a number of companies and organizations including Capon Valley Bank, Hampshire County's Legal Advisory Board, the Hampshire County Food Administration, and Hampshire County orchard owners. Zimmerman was the secretary for the Winchester and Western Railroad. While serving in the West Virginia House of Delegates, Zimmerman was appointed by West Virginia Governor John Jacob Cornwell to serve on a West Virginia Legislature select committee charged with drafting a road transportation bill known as the West Virginia State Road Law. He was again appointed by Governor Cornwell to serve on a similar select committee following the ratification of the \"Good Roads Amendment\" of the Constitution of West Virginia in 1920. In addition to serving in the West Virginia House of Delegates, Zimmerman was the chairman of the Hampshire County Democratic Party Committee and a member of the Second District Congressional Committee; he also participated in judicial, senatorial, and state conventions. Zimmerman played an active role in the commercial apple orchard industry of Hampshire County, and he operated at least three commercial orchards there."

  "text" : "Jesse Miller, Jr. (August 16, 1921 – January 24, 1950) was an American jazz trumpeter and bandleader. Born in Houston, Texas, he moved to Chicago where he studied under Captain Walter Dyett at the DuSable High School. Turning professional in 1940, he played in the bands of Tiny Bradshaw and King Kolax. He went on to join Milt Larkin's house band at the Rhumboogie in 1941, with Calvin Ladnier, Clarence Trice and Miller on trumpets, Arnett Sparrow and Streamline Williams on trombones, Frank Dominguez, Tom Archia (billed as Ernest Archey), Moses Grant and Sam Player on saxes, Cedric Haywood on piano, Lawrerence Cato on bass and Alvin Burroughs on drums. In 1942, he was a member of Earl Hines' orchestra featuring Billy Eckstine on vocals (with George Dixon, Pee Wee Jackson, Shorts McConnell, and Miller on trumpets, Jo McLewis, George Hunt, Gerry Valentine on trombones, Budd Johnson, Robert Crowder (tenor sax), Leroy Harris, Scoops Carry (alto sax), Hines on piano, Clifford Best on guitar), Truck Parham on bass, and Rudy Taylor on drums. He was in the following line-up when Sarah Vaughan joined it (with Dizzy Gillespie, McConnell, Miller and Gail Brockman on trumpets, Charlie Parker and Thomas Crump on tenor saxes, Andrew \"Goon\" Gardner and Carry on alto saxes, John Williams on baritone, Cliff Smalls (also on piano), Gus Chappell, Bennie Green and Howard \"Scotty\" Scott (later Mohammed Sadiq) on trombones, Wilson on drums, Connie Wainwright on guitar and Paul O. Simpson and/or Ted \"Mohawk\" Sturgis on bass). In April 1944, he recorded with a line-up featuring Eddie Johnson, Jimmy Jones, John Levy and Alvin Burroughs. In August 1944, Ben Webster took up a residency, which lasted until January 1945, at the Garrick Lounge's Garrick Stage, where his band alternated with Miller's band, with Webster often sitting in with them. Miller's band at the time comprised Johnny Board, Argonne Thornton (Hadik Hakim), Rail Wilson and Hillard Brown. Webster took Miller's rhythm section with him to his next booking at New York's Onyx Club. Miller also led a band at Joe's Deluxe Club with Ike Day on drums, and went on to lead the house band at Club DeLisa, taking over from Red Saunders, from June 1945 to February 1946, when Fletcher Henderson took up the residency. It's likely that during these two residencies is when Sun Ra collaborated with both bandleaders as arranger and/or pianist. Shortly after recording with Gene Ammons, on October 4, 1949, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease, and died within a few months."

Following the Parnell Split, he became an anti-Parnellite, and in the 1892 general election he was defeated by the Parnellite candidate, William Redmond. Cox launched an election petition, aiming to unseat Redmond, claiming corrupt practices and intimidation. The case was lost, however. Two years later he was declared insolvent, following the award of costs against him following the case. At that time, he had been acting as London agent for a wine company for a number of years."

In December 1944, he recorded with Billy Eckstine and His Orchestra, with Oscar Pettiford, Art Blakey, Dexter Gordon, Gene Ammons, Thomas Crump, Wardell Gray, Dizzy Gillespie, Chippy Outcalt, and Trummie Young, among others. The album was released in 1960 as Mr \"B\". In 1945, he recorded in New York with Don Byas and Hal Singer. At the beginning of 1947, Powell was with Illinois Jacquet and his Orchestra, which featured Miles Davis, Marion Hazel, Fats Navarro and Joe Newman on trumpets, Gus Chapwell, Ted Kelly, Eli Robinson and Dickie Wells on trombones, Ray Perry and Powell on alto saxes, Jacquet and Big Nick Nicholas on tenor saxes, Leo Parker on baritone sax, Bill Doggett and Leonard Feather on piano, Al Lucas on bass and Shadow Wilson on drums, together with Tadd Dameron and Jimmy Mundi as arrangers.

  "text" : "Jacob Kabrun Jr. (1759–1814) was a wealthy merchant, book and art collector, and philanthropist who lived in Danzig (present-day Gdańsk in Poland). In the late 17th century, a Scottish merchant named Cockburn established a German branch of the family, which adopted the Germanized surname 'Kabrun', in the Hanseatic port of Danzig. Jacob Kabrun Jr. was the great-grandson of the Scottish founder of the successful Kabrun merchant trading house. From September to December 1804 the future philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer gained business experience working for Kabrun's firm. Kabrun was friends with Schopenhauer's father, a member of another Danzig merchant family. Kabrun built up and maintained an extensive collection containing books and several thousand valuable drawings, paintings and prints. By the time that he bequeathed his collection to the city of Danzig it contained 339 oil paintings, 1950 watercolors and drawings, and 10883 engravings and woodcuts. The surviving collection is now held in the Gdańsk National Museum. Many works from the original collection were unfortunately looted or destroyed during the Second World War. The collection of Far Eastern art and the collection of antique coins had disappeared entirely by the end of the war. Kabrun also bequeathed 100000 florins to establish a Business Academy in Danzig."

  "text" : "Juan Sánchez (born July 1954) -- also Juan Sanchez -- is an American artist and one of the most important Nuyorican cultural figures to emerge in the second half of the 20th century. Born to Puerto Rican parents in Brooklyn, New York, his works include photography, paintings and mixed media works. His pieces are held in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others. He is part of a generation of artists—such as Coco Fusco, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Pepón Osorio and Papo Colo—who in the 1980s and '90s explored questions of ethnic, racial and national identity in their work, be it through painting, video, performance or installation. Sánchez specifically became known for producing brightly hued mixed media canvases that addressed issues of Puerto Rican life in the U.S. and on the island. Of his work, critic Lucy Lippard once wrote: \"it teaches us new ways of seeing what surrounds us.\" Sanchez combines painting and photography with other media clippings and found objects to confront America's political policies and social practices concerning his parents' homeland of Puerto Rico. Sanchez often specifically addresses Puerto Rico's battle for independence and the numerous obstacles facing disadvantaged Puerto Ricans in America. Sánchez is a professor of painting, photography and combined media at Hunter College in New York City."

  "text" : "Johann Hieronymus Kniphof (24 February 1704, Erfurt – 23 January 1763) was a German physician and botanist. He studied medicine at the Universities of Jena and Erfurt, becoming a professor of medicine at the latter institution in 1737. In 1745 he succeeded Andreas Elias Büchner (1701–1769) as director of the library at Erfurt, two years later being named dean to the faculty of medicine. In 1761 he was chosen as university rector. At Erfurt, he assembled a large and impressive herbarium, about which in 1733, he first published a work with the title of \"Botanica in originali\"  (later releases known as \"Botanica in Originali, seu Herbarium Vivum\"). Considered to be Kniphof's magnum opus, it would eventually be published in several editions. It was renowned for employing a preparation/printing technique known as \"nature printing\", which at the time was a little understood process that Kniphof had mastered in order to imprint details of various botanical specimens. The botanical genus Kniphofia (family Asphodelaceae) was named in his honor by botanist Conrad Moench (1745–1805). The standard author abbreviation Kniph. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Johann Gottlieb Gleditsch (5 February 1714 in Leipzig – 5 October 1786 in Berlin) was a German physician and botanist known for pioneer investigations of plant sexuality and reproduction. He studied medicine and other subjects at the University of Leipzig (1728–35), where one of his instructors was naturalist Johann Ernst Hebenstreit (1703–1757). From 1742 he gave lectures in physiology, botany and materia medica at the University of Frankfurt, afterwards relocating to Berlin as a professor of botany at the Collegium Medico-chirurgicum and director of the local botanical garden. Beginning in 1770, he gave lectures at the recently established institute of forestry, where he was instrumental in providing a scientific basis for the field of forestry. In his experiments involving plant movement, he demonstrated the influence that climatic factors had upon plant organs. Also, his views on the role that insects play in pollination of plants was considered to be ahead of its time. The botanical genus Gleditsia (family Fabaceae) is named in his honor, as is the botanical journal \"Gleditschia\". In Berlin-Schöneberg, a thoroughfare called Gleditschstraße bears his name."

  "text" : "\"Doctor\" John Clarke (1773–1846) was an American businessman who played a major role in the development of Saratoga Springs, New York in the 1800s. Usually called \"Doctor Clarke\", in fact the \"Doctor\" was a courtesy title. Born in Yorkshire England, Clarke immigrated to America and settled in New York City. In 1819 he opened the first soda fountain there. In 1823 he purchased land in Saratoga Springs with partner Thomas Lynch. The property included the Congress Spring in what is now Congress Park, at that time a swamp. Clarke drained the swamp to create a park and built a bottling plant there. In 1825 Lynch and Clarke began bottling Congress Spring Water. Lynch died in 1833 and Clarke continued the business alone. Clarke built a doric pavilion to cover Congress Spring, which was torn down in 1876 when Frederick Law Olmsted redesigned the park and reconstructed in the 1970s. Clarke planned and named Circular Street in Saratoga Springs, and in 1832 he built a Greek Revival mansion there overlooking Congress Park. He donated land to build an Episcopal church on the south-east corner of Circular Street and Union Avenue (then called East Congress Street). A change of plans resulted in the location moving to Washington Street where the Bethesda Episcopal Church was built in 1842.However the original plan caused the site to be christened Temple Grove, and later the Temple Grove Ladies Seminary, a predecessor of Skidmore College was constructed on the site. Clarke began to accumulate land east of Congress Park from the time he arrived in Saratoga Springs. At his death he owned nearly 1,000 acres (400 ha). Dr. Clarke was married to Mrs. Eliza (Bryer) White, widow of Charles White, with whom he had three children, Eliza(Sep 6, 1829−Apr 25, 1894), Thomas (d.August 16, 1880 ), and George B. He died on May 6, 1846. and is buried in the Gideon Putnam Burying Ground in Saratoga Springs. Eliza first married Isaac Thayer and after his death in 1852 Cornelius Sheehan, and continued to occupy the house on Circular street."

His original name was Jan Sznabla, but later changed it to Johann Andreas Schnabl so that it was much more accessible to people who did not speak Polish. His family moved from Dresden to Warsaw back in the late 18th century (hence the German heritage). Warsaw was the capital of South Prussia at that time. Trained as a physician, he taught classes in natural history in Warsaw. His wide-ranging travels included scientific trips to the Caucasus, the Urals, Lapland, the Pyrenees, Corsica, Hungary and Peru. He is the taxonomic author of the family Fanniidae  and the genera Spilogona and Paregle. With Heinrich Dziedzicki, he described the genera Polietina, Pegoplata and Villeneuvia. He is commemorated with the species Mycetophila schnablii (a fungus gnat) and Cheilosia schnabli (a dipteran species) as well as Amorphochilus schnablii, commonly known as the smoky bat, a chiropteran native to western South America."

  "text" : "Juan Antonio Yanes (June 24, 1902 – August 8, 1987) was an executive in Venezuelan Professional Baseball League who owned the Patriotas de Venezuela franchise. Born in Caracas, Yanes was dubbed ″Yanesito″ (a shortening of his last name). For more than three decades, he was one of the leading promoters of Venezuelan baseball both in the amateur and professional fields. A colorful character and prominent businessman, he worked as an advisor during the creation of the first Venezuelan league associated with Organized Baseball, which was established in 1945. Yanes was also active in the founding of the first Professional Baseball Umpire School in 1938. In addition, he helped to develop the Venezuelan Professional Baseball Players Association and was a member of various multi-cultural organizations. Organized Venezuelan baseball started in 1927, when was created the National Baseball League, which featured teams from the cities of Caracas, La Guaira, Maracay and Valencia, that later participated in an annual National Series against teams from Barquisimeto and Maracaibo. The First Division tournament was first held in 1938 in place of the National Series. By then, Yanes came into the league with his Patriotas de Venezuela team, which won the first Championship in the revamped circuit. The Patriotas won the title again in 1941,. In 1945, Yanes convinced some First Division teams owners of about the need to incorporate Venezuela in Organized Baseball. The deal was completed in December of that year with the creation of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. The league was formally registered as an institution in early January 1946, and in the same month organized its first tournament with the participation of the teams Cervecería Caracas, Navegantes del Magallanes, Sabios de Vargas, and Yanes' Patriotas de Venezuela. Yanes was elected as the League's front officer administrator and stayed in front of his team until 1955. Unfortunately for him, profits from the club declined sharply after 1951 as attendance collapsed. Although moderately successful with his business ventures, he was not earning anything close to enough capital to cover the costs of his baseball team for many years, much less to accumulate substantial wealth, being forced to resign in the face of imminent bankruptcy proceedings. Nevertheless, Yanes did not fail to cooperate with Venezuelan baseball as best he could do it. In fact, he facilitated the entry of the Licoreros de Pampero as a substitute franchise in 1955 and later played a significant role in the formation of the Aguilas del Zulia club, which joined the expanded Venezuelan Professional Baseball League in 1969, to give Zulia state its most successful baseball franchise since the 1950s, by winning five League championships and two Caribbean Series titles spanning 1984–2000. Yanes lived his entire life in Caracas. After retiring, he enjoyed spending time at home with his family and eventually going to the city's ballpark, where he shared memories and countless anecdotes with close friends, broadcasters, journalists, and baseball people. He died in 1987 at the age of 85. Sixteen years after his death, Yanes was inducted into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in its inaugural class of 2003."

  "text" : "Julie Hayden (1938/39 — September 14, 1981) was an American short story writer and staff member at The New Yorker magazine. In 1976, Viking Press published her only collection of short stories, The Lists of the Past. Day-old Baby Rats is one of her famous stories, which was chosen and read in 2010 by writer Lorrie Moore on The New Yorker podcast with fiction editor Deborah Treisman. Hayden's story collection was selected by bestselling author Cheryl Strayed for republication with Pharos Editions out of Seattle, and was published in May 2014. Hayden was born in the village of Larchmont, 18 miles from Midtown Manhattan, and educated at Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private girls' school in Greenwich, Connecticut, and at Radcliffe College, from which she graduated cum laude in 1961 with a Bachelors degree in English. In 1966, she joined the staff of The New Yorker and worked there as the newsbreak editor for 15 years, until her death. During this time, she published ten short stories in the magazine (republished in The Lists of the Past). Shortly following the publication of her collection in 1976, a breast cancer diagnosis and rapid decline into ill health and advancing alcoholism appear to have prevented significant further writing. (Additional research needed on uncollected stories published after 1976). Hayden was the daughter of Pulitzer Prize-winning author and poet Phyllis McGinley. Hayden was 42 years old when she died of cancer at the Columbia–Presbyterian Medical Center. The September 14th issue of The New Yorker contained her last piece, a profile on the gardens at the Church of St. Luke in the Fields, where her memorial was held."

  "text" : "Josephine G. Fountain was a registered nurse (RN) at the University of Florida Teaching Hospital and Clinics, best remembered for inventing the direct suction tracheotomy tube and holding its patent (no. 3039469). The significance of the direct suction tracheotomy tube is found in the way it addressed a persistent complication in tracheotomy operations; where the mucous secretions within a patient's trachea block a portion of the inner cannula tube and attempting to remedy the situation by inserting suction tube further blocks a patient's airways. As a result, the patient feels insecure and has trouble breathing. Fountain's patent for the direct suction tracheotomy tube answered this issue. The invention also was an improved tracheotomy tube that allowed introduction of gases other than air without reducing the diameter of the tube. Fountain filed her application for the direct suction tracheotomy tube patent on May 9, 1960 and the patent was awarded on June 19, 1962. It has been cited 26 times by other patent applications."

  "text" : "John B. Chapin, M.D. (1829-1918) (physician) John Chapin was an American physician and mental hospital administrator. He was an advocate for the removal of mentally ill patients from the almshouses in New York State to a hospital setting. He helped to pass a state law that provided hospital care for the patients. Chapin’s father was interested in the care of the blind, and he moved the family from New York to Pennsylvania, and then to Columbus, Ohio, where his father became director of the Institution for the Blind. In 1849, Chapin entered the Western Reserve College (Ohio). After a year, he transferred to Williams College (Massachusetts) and received the A.B. degree in 1850. Chapin began his medical career under Dr. John Swett, an attending physician at New York Hospital. (Chapin’s maternal great grandfather had been a hospital governor and a charter member). In 1852, Chapin was a member of the medical staff and attended lectures at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. In 1853, he received his medical degree. He was named house physician at a New York Hospital in 1854. On completion of his training at the New York Hospital, he joined the medical staff of the State Lunatic Hospital in Utica, New York, then the only public mental hospital in the state. He worked there for four years. From 1858 to 1860, he organized and managed an institution for the blind in St. Louis, Missouri. He returned to Canandaigua, New York to practice at Brigham Hall, a private mental hospital. By the mid-nineteenth century, the New York State Medical Society was interested in the care of insane people in the counties’ almshouses. Existing laws and practices provided that people who had been insane for a year or more could be committed to local almshouses by the state’s courts, where there was little medical care and poor living conditions. The New York State Legislature passed a law that courts could appoint a physician in each county to visit the almshouses and to report to the state Legislature on the insane confined there. The reports were sent to the New York State Medical Society, which urged the state Legislature to provide a hospital for the mentally ill patients. In 1865, the Legislature authorized such an institution and mandated that insane people would no longer be committed to counties’ almshouses. Chapin was appointed by the New York State Governor to a committee to select a site for the new facility. Chapin was responsible for planning the construction and chose to create a segregated facility with access to farm facilities for patient occupational therapy. The Legislature appointed a Board of Trustees which elected Chapin as its first superintendent. He remained in the post until 1884. The new hospital led in the care of chronic mentally ill people. In 1884, following the death of Dr. Thomas Kirkbridge, the first physician-in-Chief of the Department of the Insane of the Pennsylvania Hospital, Chapin was named the new chief physician and remained there for 23 years. He authorized the building of new facilities to accommodate a growing patient population; the opening of a dispensary for treating incipient cases; and the instituting of new practices to improve patient care. He retired in 1911 and spent his last years at his home in Canandaigua, New York. Chapin received numerous honors during his active years including L.L.D. degrees from Williams College and Jefferson Medical College. He was an honorary member of the Medical Psychological Association of Great Britain and Ireland, and the Société de Médicine Mentale de Belgium. He was an active member of the American Medico-Psychological Association (now the American Psychiatric Association) and was president from 1888 to 1889."

  "text" : "John Hugh \"Jack\" Phillipps CBE (born Auckland, 1 January 1898, died Wellington, New Zealand, 8 June 1977) was a New Zealand cricket administrator. He managed the New Zealand cricket team's tours of England in 1949 and 1958, and the MCC's tour of New Zealand in 1960-61. He served as a rifleman with the New Zealand forces in the First World War, and in the Transport Corps in the Second World War as a lieutenant colonel, and was awarded the OBE in the 1946 New Year Honours. Of his management of the 1949 team, Wisden commented: \"No more efficient or courteous manager of a touring side can be imagined than Mr J.H. Phillipps.\" He also played in the two-day match against Durham but did not bat or bowl. A benefit match for him was played in Wellington in December 1956, between Wellington and \"J.H. Phillipps' XI\", a team of players from the 1949 touring team. It was regarded as a first-class match at the time but was later downgraded by the New Zealand authorities, perhaps because many of the Phillipps XI had by that time retired from first-class cricket. He was promoted to CBE in the 1960 New Year Honours.On 5 July 1960 he was one of 63 administrators and former players from overseas countries to be invited to become honorary life members of the MCC. After the ill-will caused during the MCC's tour of New Zealand in 1958-59, an MCC tour of New Zealand by a young side of Test aspirants was organised for the 1960-61 season, captained by the diplomatic Dennis Silk and managed by Phillipps. His brief Wisden obituary described him as \"a man universally loved and respected\"."

  "text" : "Dame Judi Dench is an English actress who has worked in theater, television, and film. Dench made her professional debut in 1957 with the Old Vic Company. Over the following few years she played in several of Shakespeare's plays in such roles as Ophelia in Hamlet, Juliet in Romeo and Juliet and Lady Macbeth in Macbeth. She branched into film work, and won a BAFTA Award as Most Promising Newcomer; however, most of her work during this period was in theatre. Over the next two decades, she established herself as one of the most significant British theatre performers, working for the National Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company. In television, she achieved success during this period, in the series A Fine Romance from 1981 until 1984 and in 1992 began a continuing role in the television romantic comedy series As Time Goes By. Her film appearances were infrequent until she was cast as M in GoldenEye (1995), a role she continued to play in James Bond in films through to Spectre (2015). She received several notable film awards for her role as Queen Victoria in Mrs. Brown (1997), and has since been acclaimed for her work in such films as Shakespeare in Love (1998), Chocolat (2000), Iris (2001), Mrs Henderson Presents (2005) and Notes on a Scandal (2006), the television production The Last of the Blonde Bombshells (2001), and Skyfall (2012)."

Although her mother had French Canadian background and spoke French with her relatives, Lusher never learned French. During high school, she was interested in music, and played several instruments in the school band and orchestra, but later decided to pursue a career in science. Lusher never married. Lusher received her medical degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1960, and went on to do internship at the George Washington University Hospital in Washington D.C., and pediatric residency and chief residency at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana. During her pediatric residency at Charity Hospital, Lusher took care of a young girl with hemophilia (a rare occurrence for an X-linked recessive disorder), which stimulated her interest in blood coagulation and bleeding diseases. Her interest in bleeding disorders would later a become a lifelong dedication. In order to increase her knowledge in pediatric hematology, Lusher went to Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit for a brief rotation with Dr Wolf W. Zuelzer, a prominent pediatric hematologist then. Upon her return to Charity Hospital, she took on the care of children with blood diseases and cancers there. At the completion her residency, Lusher returned to Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, for a fellowship in pediatric hematology/oncology (1964-1966). She completed the third year of her fellowship with Teresa Vietti at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, where she focused on pediatric oncology and the treatment protocols of the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG). Dr Lusher returned to Detroit in 1966, this time as a staff pediatric hematologist/oncologist."

In order to keep up with his gambling debts, Brodak robbed 11 banks over two months, accruing only about $44,000 in the process. Casino chips and horse racing slips were found in his possession when he was arrested, along with the disguise in plain view on the backseat of his car. He was sentenced to 10 years for Felony Bank Robbery, a sentence of which he served 7 years. After his release, Brodak resumed working for General Motors but fell behind in gambling debts again, and reverted to bank robbery again in January 2009, robbing a bank in Warren, Michigan. Pursued by a witness at the scene, Brodak was apprehended by police after a short pursuit. He received 10 years, well below the sentencing guidelines, due to his age and reported trauma from PTSD stemming from his service in The Vietnam War. Stephen Pasden Jr., the witness who followed Brodak and led to his capture, was given a commendation for his good citizenship by the Warren City Police Commissioner."

  "text" : "Joshua Meyer (born 1974, Lubbock, Texas, United States) is an American artist, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He earned his B.A. from Yale University and also studied at the Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem. He is known for his oil paintings of people, and for a searching process by which they emerge, trail off, wander, get lost, experiment and reemerge. This searching quality is characterized by a thick texture in many of his paintings, influenced by Alberto Giacometti, Frank Auerbach, and Rembrandt van Rijn. Every painting emerges from struggle and re-evaluation. The artist's work has been shown in galleries and museums across the United States, Europe and Asia, including a solo exhibition, Tohu vaVohu  at the Hebrew College in Boston (2004), and Becoming (2006) at the Yale Slifka Center and NYU Bronfman Center. “Commanding visions,” emerge from the midst of Meyer’s thickly layered paint, according to Hebrew College Professor Steven Copeland in the introduction to the 2004 Tohu vaVohu catalog. “He engages...fateful questions concerning the character of art and of Judaism, their possibilities, challenges and problems.” Meyer’s subjects play a hide-and-seek game with the viewer, often dissolving into the paint. According to Allegra Goodman, in the introduction to the 2013 exhibition catalog Rustle, Sparkle, Flutter, Float, these people “will reveal themselves, and they will disappear. Look at them up close and they scatter, self-effacing.” The figures are elusive and appear introspective. “Some artists try to depict our world. Meyer presents people in their own worlds, and invites us to enter.” Meyer is a recipient of a Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant as well as the Sustainable Arts Foundation Award, and a 2010 Painting Fellowship from the Massachusetts Cultural Council. Meyer’s work has been written up in The San Francisco Chronicle, The Forward, The Philadelphia Metro, New Haven Register, Art New England, The Boston Phoenix and The Boston Globe. Meyer is represented by Rice Polak Gallery in Provincetown and Dolby Chadwick Gallery in San Francisco."

He was also a leading ecclesiastic, whose most senior office was Chancellor of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He took his name from his birthplace, Mitchel Troy in Monmouthshire. He is first heard of in Ireland in 1346 when he was prebendary of Cloyne. On the removal of William de Epworth, he became second Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1347; Epworth was restored to office the following year but Troye was permitted to continue drawing the salary and was given another position in the Exchequer of Ireland as Clerk of the Wages. The Exchequer was then divided into two rival factions: Troye was closely associated with the faction headed by John de Burnham, the Treasurer. From 1348 onwards, for several years Burnham was under constant attack from the rival faction, headed by William de Barton, for alleged financial irregularities, and he spent much of his time in England attempting to clear his name. Troye became involved in the controversy: he had already clashed with the English Exchequer over his accounts and been threatened with distraint of his property. He and Burnham were now accused of corruptly diverting accounts to their own use, but they were both eventually cleared of all charges. He was a notorious pluralist: in addition to Cloyne and the Chancellorship of St. Patrick's Cathedral, he was prebendary of Ferns and of Emly. He also held the English living of Amersham in Buckinghamshire. Troye became Treasurer in 1364 or 1365 and Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1368. He probably died in 1371."

Ramsay represented Mount Barker in the South Australian Legislative Assembly from 5 April 1870 (along with John Cheriton), and on 7 July 1880 was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council, for which he sat until of his death. Ramsay was Commissioner of Public Works in the Henry Ayers Ministry from January to March 1872 and in the two John Cox Bray governments from June 1881 to June 1884. Ramsay was Chief Secretary under John Cox Bray from 23 April 1884 to 16 June 1884; and under Thomas Playford II from 11 June 1887 to 27 June 1889. In 1886 Ramsay received the Queen's permission to bear the style of The Honourable within the colony.On 20 January 1890, Ramsay died from injuries sustained when an oil lamp in a railway carriage in which he was travelling burst, showering him with burning kerosene."

Among other interests, he served as president of the Bank of Wilmington and Brandywine and invested in real estate in Baltimore, Maryland, and \"western lands\". Canby's interest in railroads stemmed from his belief that the newish transportation method could benefit his milling business. In the 1830s, he helped organize and obtain a state charter for the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad, of which he served as president until 1837. From 1835, he also served as a director of the Delaware and Maryland Railroad. The W&S and D&M joined two other railroads to create the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore. (The main line survives today as part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.) His service as a railroad executive is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument in Philadelphia."

  "text" : "Joseph \"Joe\" Morton was an American war correspondent for the Associated Press (AP) in the European Theater during World War II.

Although the Allied officers were duly uniformed and Morton had a war correspondent ID in order to be treated as prisoners of war according to the Geneva Convention (1929), the SS headquarters, in compliance with Commando Order, which stated that all Allied commandos should be killed immediately without trial even those in proper uniforms, ordered the summary execution of Allied officers and others caught in the act. On January 24, 1945, Joseph Morton, along with 13 Allied officers, was executed at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. He was the only Allied correspondent to be executed by the Axis during World War II."

  "text" : "Jesse Montgomery Mosher, M.D. (1864-1922), an American physician, practiced psychiatry in Albany, New York and served as editor to medical journals. He was credited with establishing the first psychiatric ward within the organization of a general hospital. Mosher was born in Albany, New York, the son of a physician. In 1876, he entered The Albany Academy. In 1882, he entered the Union College in New York and graduated in 1866. During his senior year, he served as an apothecary at the Utica State Hospital. He studied medicine at the Albany Medical College, receiving his M.D. in 1889. His thesis was “General Paralysis of the Insane.” He visited the Willard State Hospital and the Willard Asylum for the Insane in New York in 1883 when he spent summer vacations in the area. After receiving his medical degree, he entered employment at Willard as a junior physician and then second assistant physician. When the then Superintendent of Willard transferred to the St. Lawrence State Hospital in 1890, Mosher followed him. He stayed for five years there as first assistant physician. He resigned because of political interference. Preparing to enter medical practice in Albany, Mosher spent six months in Europe visiting medical and psychiatric clinics in Vienna, Berlin, London, and Edinburgh. On his return, the Albany Medical College and Hospital appointed him clinical professor of psychiatry and provided a clinic. The hospital, which had opened in 1849, opened new facilities in 1898, which included several connected buildings. With the support of local physicians, Mosher persuaded the hospital authorities to include a separate pavilion for psychiatric patients since the nearest state mental hospital was 75 miles away. The purpose of the ward was transient accommodation for insane patients committed to the state hospital, treatment of mild cases of insanity who may recover in general hospital, alcoholic and drug addicted patients, and patients in the course of treatment for medical and surgical illnesses who develop mental disorders. From 1902 to 1904, the ward admitted 331 patients: 24 transferred from other wards, 24 with acute delirium, 20% with melancholy or mania, 20% alcoholics, and others with dementia, uremia, and eclampsia. Recovered patients numbered 110: 96 improved while 25 died. In 1908, Mosher was named Clinical Professor of Insanity, Nervous Disease and Electro-Therapeutics at the Albany Medical College, a position he held until his death in 1922. He became a joint editor of the Albany Medical Annals and held the position for 25 years until his death. For many years, he served on the editorial board of the American Journal of Insanity, later the ''Journal of the American Psychiatric Association'' (JAPA). He was a member of the American Neurological Association, and was affiliated with the Brady Memorial Hospital in Albany, the Albany Hospital for Incurables, and the Children’s Hospital in Albany. He was active in civic organizations including the Albany Academy, the Albany Hospital, and the Advisory Selective Service Board for New York during World War I. Mosher is credited with establishing the first psychiatric ward as part of a general hospital, a practice later adopted throughout the United States. By 1931, 122 of 420 general hospitals reported building special facilities for psychiatric patients. He died of heart disease in December 1922."

She also became a strong advocate for women drivers and the Good Roads Movement. Unfortunately after women were banned from organized racing, she was no longer able to race and was reduced to setting women's speed records. After her husband's scandalous involvement with a showgirl, they divorced. Joan Cuneo then moved away from New York City where she had lived with her husband and children,first to Vermont and then to the upper peninsula of Michigan. There she married James Francis Sickman, her childhood sweetheart, shortly before her death.

  "text" : "Sir John Spencer (1455 – 14 April 1522) was an English landowner, entrepreneur and ancestor of the Spencer family. In 1469, John Spencer's uncle – another John Spencer – had become feoffee (feudal lord) of Wormleighton in Warwickshire and a tenant at Althorp in Northamptonshire in 1486. The Spencers’ administration of their Northamptonshire and Warwickshire estates was admired and often emulated by gentlemen all over England. Sheep from their pastures were purchased for breeding and it is probable that the family’s success as farmers was rarely equalled in the century. John Spencer first made a living by trading in livestock and other commodities and eventually saved enough money to purchase both the Wormleighton and Althorp lands. Wormleighton was bought in 1506, the manor house was completed in 1512. In 1508, John Spencer also purchased the estate of Althorp with its moated house and several hundred acres of farmland. He had grazed sheep here from the 1480s. Impressed by the quality of the land, he eventually bought it and rebuilt the house in 1508. At that time, his estate and mansion in Warwickshire were considerably larger, the house in Wormleighton was four times the size of Althorp. In 1511 he made further purchases to acquire much of the surrounding countryside, including the villages of Little Brington and Great Brington as well their parish church of St Mary the Virgin, from Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset. By putting down roots at Althorp, Sir John provided what was to become a home for the next 19 generations. Between 1513 and 1515, Sir John Spencer devoted much funds and planning to the parish church for Althorp, St Mary the Virgin in Great Brington. In 1513, he appointed Thomas Heritage to be rector of the church, who had previously been chaplain to King Henry VII and surveyor of the monarch's works at Westminster Abbey. It is altogether probable that Heritage designed and superintended the execution of Spencer's idea for a family chapel at the parish church. His will, dated the 12th day of April 1522, just two days before Sir John death, states that he virtually rebuilt the whole church. His bequests included \"oon hool syte of vestments and a chales\", \"the making of the chauncell roffe with the ledde, wall and wyndowes, and my armes to be sett in the same wyndowes\" as well as his tomb, shared with his lady Isabella Graunt. For this tomb, to be placed in the easternmost bay of the family chapel, nearest to the altar, he left the sum of 20 pounds. In 1519 John Spencer was knighted by King Henry VIII, died three years later and was buried in the new family chapel at Great Brington. His younger son and successor Sir William Spencer later bequeathed the church's east window of stained glass which depicted St. John the Baptist and the Spencer coat of arms, now in a south window of the chancel, in memory of his father."

After the Armenian Genocide, Jackson led a relief effort and was credited with saving the lives of \"thousands of Armenians.\" After serving as consul in Aleppo, Jackson served in Italy and Canada.

Born in Haifa, he joined the Palestine Communist Party before he turned 20, and was responsible for its publication al-Ittihad. The Communist Party split along nationalist lines in 1939, and Jabra Nicola refused to join either wing,  and, after being imprisoned by the British occupation from 1940–1942, was recruited to a small Trotskyist movement by Yigael Gluckstein, later better known as Tony Cliff.  However, with the collapse of the group in the late 1940s, Jabra Nicola returned to the Palestinian Communist Party. While in the Communist Party he played a leading role on the party's publications, but when, after 1962, a small new left movement, the Matzpen group, revived in what was now Israel, he was to join it for a second and final time. Placed under house arrest after the Six-Day War in 1967, he left Israel for London in 1970, where he lived until his death in 1974. In 1963, Nicola was elected to the International Executive Committee of the Fourth International, for which he wrote many articles and pamphlets, and translated Marxist classics into Arabic.  His most important theoretical essays were Theses on the Revolution in the Arab East ) (1972)  and Arab Revolution and National Problems in the Arab East (1973), written together with Moshé Machover. Jabra Nicola lived with political activist Aliza Novik (b. 1912, Tiberias, d. 1970 Haifa), with whom he had three children."

  "text" : "John Bermyngham or Bermingham (died 1415) was an Irish lawyer and judge. He was one of the first lawyers to be referred to as King's Serjeant and was appointed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, but apparently did not take up the office. He belonged to the prominent Anglo-Irish Bermingham dynasty, which acquired the titles Earl of Louth and Baron Athenry. He was appointed Serjeant in 1388; he was one of the first law officers to be so described, although the office itself dates from about 1260. His appointment was limited to Dublin and the counties of the Pale. Hart notes that such local appointments were common at the time, reflecting the disturbed state of the English colony in Ireland, when no one travelled from Dublin to  County Cork without an armed escort, and Carlow, seat of the Exchequer of Ireland, had recently been burned. He went to England to further his law studies in 1392 (Ireland at that time had no law school), but Hart believes that he probably acted as Serjeant until 1402, when he became second justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). He was chosen as Chief Justice in 1407 but for reasons which are unclear seems not to have taken up office, since Stephen de Bray, appointed in 1403, remained Chief until 1426. He died in 1415. He was probably the grandfather of Philip Bermingham (died 1490), Lord Chief Justice of Ireland."

His first title at the Birmingham Coca-Cola PBA Open featured a win over the legendary Don Carter in the final match. Biondolillo became most famous for rolling the first-ever perfect 300 game to be broadcast live on national television in the U.S. This occurred April 1, 1967, in the opening match of the TV finals at the 1967 Firestone Tournament of Champions, though he did not go on to win the tournament. Hampered by a bowling injury that occurred in 1968, Biondolillo retired from the PBA in 1972. A Houston, Texas native, Biondolillo was inducted into the Texas State Bowling Hall of Fame in 1988."

  "text" : "Jacob I. Cohen Jr. (born September 30, 1789, in Richmond, Virginia; died April 6, 1869, in Baltimore, Maryland) was a banker, railroad executive, and civic leader who helped win for Jews the right to hold public office in Maryland. Sources differ on some details of his early life. The 1912 History of the Jews in America says his father was \"Jacob J. Cohen\", who emigrated from Rhenish Prussia to the American colonies in 1773, fought in the Revolutionary War, and died in 1808. The Maryland State Archives gives his father's name as \"Israel I. Cohen\", who died in 1803. The 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia says that the elder Jacob was the older brother of Israel, who followed him from Oberdorf, near Nördlingen, Bavaria, to Richmond in 1787, and there became the father of Jacob I. Cohen Jr. All agree that after the elder Cohen died, his widow, Judith Solomon Cohen (1766-1837), moved her six surviving children, all sons, from Richmond to Baltimore, where the family came to have sizeable influence. Jacob and at least one of his brothers served with distinction in the defense of the city during the War of 1812. In 1812, Cohen and his brothers founded Cohen's Lottery and Exchange Office, which became one of Baltimore's foremost lottery brokers, with branches in several other East Coast cities. Cohen brought each of his five brothers into business with him, and the arrest of two of them, Philip J. Cohen and Mendes J. Cohen, on charges of selling National Lottery tickets in Virginia led to a major U.S Supreme Court decision in Cohens v. Virginia. In 1820, Cohen's house on North Charles Street became the first private house in Baltimore to be lit with gas. In the early 1820s, Cohen and Solomon Etting (1764-1847) led the fight for the \"Jew Bill,\" which, when passed in 1825 by Maryland's General Assembly, altered the state's Test Act to allow members of the Jewish faith to hold public office upon swearing to a belief in \"the doctrine of reward and punishment\" rather than the generally required declaration of belief in Christianity. After the bill was passed, Cohen and Etting both ran successfully for Baltimore City Council in 1826, becoming the first Jews to hold elected office in Maryland. In 1830, he helped establish the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners, serving as its secretary and treasurer for eight years. He was also a member of the Baltimore City Commissioners of Finance. Also in 1830, Cohen and his brothers partners established J. I. Cohen Jr. & Brothers' Banking House, which would be one of the few banks to survive the Panic of 1837. In the mid-1830s, Cohen became a director of the Baltimore and Port Deposit Railroad (on October 12, 1835) and of the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad, two companies chartered by the state of Maryland to build a railroad that would link Baltimore with cities to the northeast. On January 22, 1838, he succeeded Lewis Brantz as president of the B&PD after Brantz's sudden death. Within months, both railroads merged into the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, which thenceforth operated the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore. (This main line survives today as part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.) Cohen became a vice-president of the PW&B on February 20, 1838. He resigned the position on January 1, 1842, to reduce company expenses, and later in the month took a position on the southernmost of three new executive committees set up to manage the railroad. Cohen's service as a railroad executive is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument in Philadelphia. Unmarried and leaving no children, Cohen died in Baltimore on April 6, 1869."

  "text" : "John Tirel, or Tyrell (died 1395) was a prominent judge and statesman in fourteenth-century Ireland who held office as Serjeant-at-law (Ireland) and Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. He was the son of Warin Tirel: the Tirels or Tyrells were a junior branch of the leading Anglo-Irish family of Tyrell, whose senior branch, which died out in 1370, held the Irish feudal barony of Castleknock. He is said to have been a substantial landowner, though the precise location of his estates is unknown. He is known to have been in England, presumably studying law, in 1354; he then returned to Ireland, where he held office as King's Serjeant from 1372 to 1376. The position of Serjeant was an onerous one, and on occasion involved him in some physical danger, since at this time English rule in Ireland was insecure, and long journeys were often hazardous. He was a political figure of some importance, who was summoned to sit in the Irish House of Commons in the Parliaments of 1375 and 1380, and to several meetings of the Great Council. He was appointed a judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland) in 1376 and Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) in 1386. He was exempted from certain of the feudal duties of a landowner in 1378. Like many Irish judges of the period he seems to have been reluctant to go on assize: in 1380 Walter Cotterell, the King's Serjeant, was deputised to act on his place as judge of assize for Munster, Kilkenny and Wexford, \"on account of the dangers of the roads\". He died in 1395."

He exhibited a bust of Alfred, Lord Tennyson and other sculptures at the Royal Academy. He wrote a book on the history of Madame Tussauds and the book The Chosen Four about four of Napoleon Bonaparte's loyal supporters who followed him into exile on Saint Helena. In 1935, Tussaud was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. He died in Croxley Green in 1943."

Maverick became a Puritan before migrating to the Massachusetts Bay Colony at Dorchester, Massachusetts on 30 May 1630, where he served as the first minister of the First Parish Church of Dorchester with Rev.

During an active and highly successful life, she published various works on astronomy and navigation, founded an academy for the teaching of these subjects, and ran a warehouse focused on the distribution, production and repair of navigational instruments. Her Academy was highly regarded and recommended by the East India Company, Trinity House, and the Admiralty. In recognition of her work, she was awarded medals by the kings of Prussia and Holland, and her rule for calculating latitude from altitudes was described as \"ingenious\". Taylor was one of the very few women working as a scientific instrument maker in London in the 19th century. Her \"Mariner's Calculator\", patented in 1834, was dismissed by the Admiralty. However, she was awarded a Civil List pension in 1860 \"In consideration of her benevolent labours among the seafaring population of London\"."

  "text" : "Dr. James E. Fulton Jr., M.D., (February 25, 1940 – July 4, 2013) was an American dermatologist and medical researcher who co-invented Retin-A, a popular acne medication, in 1969. Fulton co-developed tretinoin, known by the brand name as Retin-A, with Dr. Albert Kligman. Fulton was also pioneer for his use of new procedures and treatments in dermatology. He is believed to be the first dermatologist to include an aesthetician on the staff of his medical team. His inclusion of an aesthetician was initially criticized by other dermatologists, but soon earned acceptance and is now widely practiced in the field. Fulton also championed the early use of fat transfer for breast augmentation and surgical procedures to alleviate acne scars."

  "text" : "Jeremiah G. Hamilton (sometimes Jerry Hamilton) was a Wall Street broker noted as \"the only black millionaire in New York\" by James McCune Smith about a decade before the American Civil War. Hamilton was a shrewd financial agent, amassing a fortune of $2 million ($43.1 million today) by the time of his death in 1875. Although he was the subject of much newspaper coverage and his life provides a unique perspective on race in 19th century America, Hamilton is virtually absent from modern historical literature. Hamilton first came to prominence in 1828 after hiding out in a fishing boat for multiple days in the Port-au-Prince harbor in Haiti and eventually escaping the Haitian authorities. They had discovered he was transporting counterfeit coins to Haiti reportedly for a group of New York merchants; in absentia he was sentenced to be shot. The ship he had chartered, the Ann Eliza Jane, was confiscated by the port officials; Hamilton claimed he had escaped with $5000 of the counterfeit coin. Almost a decade later, after the 1835 Great Fire of New York destroyed most of the buildings on the southeast tip of Manhattan, Hamilton accrued about $5 million in 2013 dollars by \"taking pitiless advantage of several of the fire victims' misfortunes\". His business practices were controversial; where most black entrepreneurs sold their goods to other blacks, \"Hamilton cut a swath through the lily-white New York business world of the mid-1830s, a domain where his depredations soon earned him the nickname of \"The Prince of Darkness\". Others, with even less affection, simply called him \"Nigger Hamilton\". Soon thereafter, he used about $7 million to buy up a substantial amount of land and property in modern-day Astoria and Poughkeepsie. Hamilton would go on to struggle with Cornelius Vanderbilt, the famous American industrialist, over control of the Nicaragua Transit Company. Although he circulated among the financial elite and was himself very wealthy, Hamilton was also a victim of the racism against African-Americans so pervasive during his time. During the New York City draft riots in 1863, white men seeking to lynch Hamilton broke into his house, but were turned away with only liquor, cigars, and an old suit by his wife Eliza after she said her husband was not home. Eliza Hamilton was white which made her marriage to Jeremiah taboo for the time. At the time of his death in May 1875, Jeremiah Hamilton was said by obituaries to be the richest black man in the United States. He is buried in his family lot in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. There is no known surviving image of Jeremiah Hamilton. As biographer Shane White has reasoned, Hamilton \"almost certainly did have photographs taken, and quite likely commissioned a painting, but if any likenesses have survived they are probably catalogued under ‘miscellaneous’ or as ‘subject unknown'.\" The 2015 biography \"Prince of Darkness\" by Shane White chronicles the life of Jeremiah G. Hamilton."

The family has roots in the ancient town of Arsèguel in Alt Urgell. From a young age, he studied at the Barcelona Llotja school, where he excelled in drawing and befriended the artists who later collaborated with him in the field of stained glass, Montsardà, Labarta, Comal, and continued to learn the craft workshop at the workshop of the glassmaker Oriach, where his brother was already working. Together, they established the workshop at No. 6 on the street Asturias in Gracia which is still present. He first worked with Darius Vilas, artist and Josep Maria Pericas, architect on stained glass of the parish of Carmen de Barcelona, on the church of Sant Joan de Reus, and on the windows of the crypt of the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. The workshop worked on making leaded windows in restoration and glass etchings. The workshop was nationalized during the civil war and both JMBonet and Xavier Bonet engaged in other professional activities. At the end of the war, the workshop focused on the reconstruction of temples destroyed during the civil war <ref>El martiri dels temples a la diòcesi de Barcelona (1936-1939) / Josep M. Martí i Bonet Arxiu Diocesà de Barcelona, 2008.</ref> JMBonet worked on the windows of the chapter house of the monastery of Poblet, on the windows of monasteries Vallbona and ceremonies in the windows of St. Mary of the Avellanas, in the parish of St. John of Lleida, on the Cathedral of Sant Feliu de Llobregat, designs by Francesc Labarta and the parishes of Jesus and St. John of Grace. She also worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol in the parishes of Santa Maria Vilanova and those of Sant Joan Despi. Xavier Bonet began new business adventures and finally left its positions in the company of stained glass that remained in the hands of Josep Maria Bonet.In addition to his work in the field of Catalan stained glass, he focused on improving materials and processes and worked on the introduction of Tiffany style lamps with tinned copper reserves and vinyl stickers that avoids the laborious use of paper tin and Judea bitumen. By the 1960s, began a new era in the window which was a new field of art with its own discourse. He worked with artists Will Faber in the windows of the transept of the church of Llars Mundet, Ramon Rogent in stained glass the chapel of the Hospital of Granollers, the parish of Ruby, in the windows Domenech milestone for the Girona Cathedral, with Charles Madiroles to Vic carmelites. Josep Maria Bonet received the letter glassmaker master craftsman in 1986. He died in Barcelona in 1988 working until almost the last day in the stained glass workshop."

  "text" : "Jane M. Carlton is a biologist at New York University whose research centers on the genomics of two groups of single-celled parasites: those which cause malaria (the genus Plasmodium), and a group known as trichomonads, which include the common sexually transmitted parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. Two species of malaria parasite account for most of the ~219 million cases reported yearly around the world. Both can adapt to and evade the limited arsenal of pharmaceutical weapons we currently use against them. One species, Plasmodium vivax, can even hide in the liver as a ‘sleeper cell’ for months before causing illness. Mastering these parasites will clearly require new approaches. Historically, scientists looking for ways to attack malaria at the molecular level have focused years of research on single malaria genes that might be vulnerable. Dr. Carlton is among a group of scientists taking a long-term, comprehensive approach—namely, recording and categorizing changes in all of the parasite’s genes at once —with a view toward detecting drug resistance in its earliest stages while it can still be controlled, finding new vulnerabilities in the parasite’s genome that can be exploited to fight malaria, and last but not least, providing basic understanding of the parasite’s complex biology. As Faculty Director of Genomic Sequencing at NYU’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, Carlton is examining the genomes of dozens of malaria isolates at a time. Recently Dr. Carlton and her colleagues sequenced several genomes from both a human malaria species (P. vivax) and a closely related monkey malaria parasite (Plasmodium cynomolgi), producing a more detailed picture of malaria evolution and uncovering a surprising amount of genetic variety in the latter. Malaria today is primarily a disease of the developing world, including India, the world’s second most populous nation. Dr. Carlton collaborates with scientists at India’s National Institute for Malaria Research to develop new research paths and control strategies for the disease there. As Program Director of a seven-year NIH International Center of Excellence in Malaria Research based jointly in New Delhi and NYU, she heads the first pan-Indian genomic survey of malaria parasite strains, along with an in-depth epidemiological study of how the malaria is transmitted and manifests itself in different ecologies and societies in India. Trichomonads are single-celled parasites that infect human and other mammals, as well as birds. One such parasite is Trichomonas vaginalis, which causes the most widespread non-viral human STD, trichomoniasis (aka ‘trich’). Dr. Carlton led the group that sequenced the genome of T. vaginalis in 2007 – the first sequencing of any trichomonad genome – and uncovered families of genes that may be responsible for the membrane irritation and damage associated with trich. The sequencing project also revealed that the parasite’s genome is surprisingly large and composed mostly of highly repetitive ‘mobile’ DNA elements. Carlton received her Ph.D. in genetics at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, and has worked at several scientific institutions in the U.S., including the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Institutes of Health and the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). She received the American Society of Parasitologists’ Stoll-Stunkard Memorial Award in 2010, was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012, and has published more than 90 research articles and reviews."

  "text" : "John Clare Whitehorn, M.D. (1894-1974) was an American psychiatric educator during the mid-20th century. Whitehorn was born in a sod house in Spencer, Nebraska, on the prairie, the son of a farmer and part-time school teacher. He graduated from Doane College in Crete, Nebraska, and won a scholarship to attend Harvard University Medical School. He graduated in 1921 and began his residency at the McLean Hospital in Waverley, Massachusetts. In 1938, Whitehorn was hired to lead the Department of Psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he remained for three years. He moved to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland as the Henry Phipps Professor of Psychiatry, succeeding Dr. Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist). Whitehorn became Professor Emeritus in 1961. In 1955, Whitehorn described his philosophy and methods of psychiatry in his Salmon lectureship of the New York Academy of Medicine, later published under the title Psychiatric Education and Progress. He was active in developing psychiatry curricula for undergraduate education and graduate education programs for psychiatric medical training. Among his private papers stored at the American Psychiatric Association (APA) was a note describing how he was collected blood from patients for a study on humoral changes and emotion. He talked with the patients and over time it became apparent that the patients with whom he developed a relationship improved clinically. His interest in the process of psychotherapy developed into a research study with Barbara Betz, M.D. The research study was published in 1975 under the title Effective Psychotherapy with The Schizophrenia Patient. The study showed that psychiatrists who took an active role in psychotherapy with schizophrenia patients were three times more successful in their patients’ clinical improvement than passive psychotherapists. Whitehorn received numerous honorary degrees: an LHD from Doane College (1947), D.Sc. from the University of Nebraska (1955), and a Sc.D. from the University of Rochester (1971). Other awards presented to Whitehorn included the Hamilton medal of the American Psychopathological Association (1953), the Gutheil Medal of the Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy (1961), the Bowis medal of the American College of Psychiatry (1967), and the Salmon Medal of the New York Academy of Medicine (1971). He was president of the American Psychiatric Association (1950-1951) and served three terms as president of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (1946, 1948, and 1949)."

  "text" : "Jean Danysz (1860 – 1928) was a Polish pathologist with a considerable career in France, spending spent much of his adult life at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. In 1890 he isolated Salmonella typhimurium. In 1893, he was involved in research into the flour moth, \"scourge of the flour mill\", Ephestia kuehniella. In 1898, he was working on Rinderpest. In 1903, he worked on a way to control the vole plague in France. He was, in 1903, the first person to use radium to treat malignant diseases. He was contacted in 1905 regarding Australia's rabbit plagues and responding to the New South Wales government's offer of £25,000 for a novel solution to the country's rabbit pest problem, he arrived in Australia the following year to advise on biological control measures. He brought a strain of Pasteurella bacteria which he had developed to selectively kill feral rabbits and conducted a series of trials on Broughton Island, New South Wales coast with his team. He left in May 1907 after a series of inconclusive trials, leaving his assistant A. Latapie with Dr. Tidswell of the NSW Health Department to continue trials. His organism was eventually proved to be identical to one already known to science, and although it was not found to be injurious to other animals, it was ineffective as a control. The Danysz phenomenon, where a toxin added to antitoxin in an equal amount at once is non-toxic but when added at intervals in a fraction results in a generally toxic mixture, was named for him."

  "text" : "John Perry Wall was a physician, and mayor of Tampa, Florida (1878–1880). In 1859 he was a surgeon at Chimborazo Hospital in Virginia, serving soldiers from Florida during Civil War. On a visit to Brooksville, Florida he married Pressie Eubanks, the nineteen-year-old daughter of a wealthy planter. In 1869 he moved to Tampa. In 1871, he contracted yellow fever aboard the steamer H. M. Cool from Cedar Key while treating a cabin boy. He carried the disease to his wife and two-year-old daughter who died within a few days. He devoted his medical career to studying yellow fever and communicable diseases. He also became more of an alcoholic. After agreeing to give up alcohol he was allowed to marry Matilda McKay, daughter of Captain James McKay. Charlie Wall was their son. Dr. Wall lived on the site of the Tampa Federal Savings and Loan Bank building. As mayor from 1878 to 1880, he worked to increase maritime trade. He founded the Tampa Board of Trade and the Tampa Chamber of Commerce, serving as its first president. He helped lead construction of the railroad from northeastern Florida to Tampa, the settlement of Vincente Martinez Ybor and a large colony of Cuban and Spanish cigar makers in what is now part of Ybor City, and helped establish the phosphate industry. He was a delegate at the Florida Constitutional Convention of 1885. Wall is buried at the Oaklawn Cemetery in downtown Tampa."

  "text" : "James Vance May (1873–1947), an American psychiatrist, was an early proponent for statistical studies and classification of mental diseases. He was among the first to recognize mental disease as a public health problem, a view that did not gain recognition and acceptance for many years. May was born in Lawrence, Kansas. He received his AB at the University of Kansas in 1894 and his medical degree at the University of Pennsylvania in 1899. He was a resident at the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia for one year then moved to the Brigham Hall Hospital in Canandaigua, New York, a private mental hospital where he was in charge of the pathology department and its laboratory. From 1900 to 1902, he served in the U.S. Army during the Philippine insurrection (Philippine War of Independence; Spanish–American War). Following his Army service, he began to work at the New York State Mental Hospital System in Central Islip, New York, but after a short stay, he transferred to the Binghamton State Hospital and stayed until 1911. He became superintendent of the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in 1911, and then moved to another position as medical member of the New York State Hospital Commission. In 1916, he moved to Massachusetts to become the superintendent of the Grafton State Hospital. Soon thereafter, he transferred to the Boston State Hospital where he stayed as superintendent from 1912 to 1936. In 1913, the American Medico Psychological Association (later the American Psychiatric Association) established a committee on statistics and May was appointed to serve as a committee member. He stayed involved with the committee for nineteen years and was the committee chair for ten years. As an administrator, he was interested in mental hospital statistics and the classification of mental diseases, which were not uniform in the United States. His interest and work in these areas culminated in a publication in 1922 of the book Mental Disease: A Public Health Problem, at a time when mental disease was not viewed as a public health issue. The committee on statistics proposed a system of classification of mental disease which was adopted by the organization and became a basis for future change in keeping with advancements in psychiatric research and practice. May contributed numerous research articles to the scholarly literature. He spoke German and nearly completed a German-English dictionary of psychiatric terms. He translated a book on schizophrenia by the German psychiatrist Karl Wilmanns. He was a member of many professional and civic groups including the New England Psychiatric Society (president, 1931–1934), the American Psychiatric Association (president, 1932–1933), Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Society for Mental Hygiene, the Boston Occupational Therapy Society, the Boston City Club, the American Legion, and the Royal Medical Psychological Society of Great Britain. May died in 1947."

He took up appointments at a series of universities; in 1968 at Northwestern University in Chicago; in 1973 at the University in Zaire; in 1974 at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut; in 1980 at the University in Amsterdam; and had visiting appointments at Bonn, Cologne, and Paris. His field research focuses on religious movements in Zaire and Kongo. Fabian wrote various critical books but his most famous is Time and the Other (1983), a classic in the field of anthropology that had changed the way that anthropologists \"make their object.\" As the blurbs on the book put it, the book is \"a radical epistemological critique of anthropological writing\" (George Marcus, University of California, Irvine) and \"Time and the Other is a critique of the notions that anthropologists are 'here and now,' their objects of study are 'there and then,' and that the 'other' exists in a time not contemporary with our own.\"His 1996 work, Remembering the Present: Paintings and popular history in Zaire was made in collaboration with the Congolese artist Tshibumba Kanda-Matulu."

  "text" : "Juan Rexach, (fl. 1431-1482) was a Spanish painter and miniaturist. His date of birth is not known. Most of his life is scarcely documented. He studied with Jacomart, in whose studio he worked, and after a period of time Rexach succeeded his master. He completed some altarpieces left incomplete by Jacomart, and worked with him on certain commissions, so sometimes attributions can be difficult. Rexach opted for large formats and monumental treatment of the figures. Rexach was an eminent painter in Valencia during the 15th century. Although his works are markedly Spanish, they also reflect influences of other European artistic style, especially Flanders. His famous painting, The Crucifixion, resembles the work of Gerard David. The architecture shown in the painting is northern. His other famous work, Madonna and Child Enthroned, was in vogue to the point of becoming a motif in Valencian art of his time. These two paintings were part of a larger retable. Among his works are the following altarpieces: \n*  The Santa Ursula, from Cubells, now in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (National Art Museum of Catalonia). Signature appears at the feet of the saint \n*  The Epiphany, from the Augustinian convent in Rubielos de Mora, also in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya \n*  The San Martin, Segorbe Cathedral \n*  The Crucifixion and the Virgin enthroned with Angels, in the Norton Simon Museum \n*  The The Annunciation, diptych (118x110 cm each table) dated circa 1460, now in the Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts"

Kerr was born in Dumfriesshire, Scotland in 1834. He was an editor and worked for the Dumfriesshire and Galloway Herald, and then the Dumfries Courier. He emigrated to Melbourne in 1858 and after some time on gold fields, he worked for The Age alongside George Fisher. In 1861, he emigrated to Otago and joined the Otago Daily Times. In 1865, he moved to Greymouth and set up the Grey River Argus. The newspaper was a rarity in that it openly declared its political affiliation; it was a supporter of the labour movement. Kerr was involved with many organisations, and sat on the borough council, was a member of the harbour board, and the education board. He was a director of the gas company, a trustee of the racecourse, and was active as a freemason. Kerr was a close friend of Richard Seddon. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 15 October 1892 by John Ballance during the Liberal Government. His term expired on 14 October 1899, and he was reappointed the following day. He served until his death on 25 August 1901. Kerr was on a journey home from New Zealand Parliament in Wellington when he became severely ill with asthma. The ship called at Westport to get medical support for Kerr. His wife and eldest son reached him at Westport before he died. Kerr was replaced by James Marshall on the Legislative Council. His eldest son, also James Kerr (1875–1938), became proprietor of the Grey River Argus. Kerr Jr. became proprietor of the Hutt and Petone Chronicle in 1912, and the Kerrs moved to Petone. Kerr Jr. was an unsuccessful candidate for the United Party when he stood in the Hutt electorate in the 1929 by-election and 1931 election. Kerr Avenue in Greymouth is named for the Hon. James Kerr."

Ordained to the priesthood in 1950, he took a degree in theology and was professor for Spirituality at the seminary. At the age of 35, younger than any Dutchman since the Reformation, he was appointed titular bishop of Aëtus and auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands in 1961 and was named bishop of the diocese in 1966, after his predecessor, the outspoken bishop Willem Marinus Bekkers, died only 58 years old (brain tumor). Bluyssen resigned in 1984 due to health reasons following an open heart surgery. He died after a short illness on 8 August 2013, aged 87, in 's-Hertogenbosch. Bluyssen was the last living Dutch bishop who actually took part in the Second Vatican Council. Furthermore he was able to celebrate his 50th anniversary of his episcopacy, a rare jubilee. At that particular time the Church in the Netherlands was heavily buried under sexual scandals by priests and religious of minors. Bluyssen called off all the already planned festivities, telling it was not a time for a feast but for shame. In his years as an ordinary Bluyssen was just like his predecessor Bekkers, be it less outspoken, a strong believer in the aggiornamento, the renewal of his Church. Rather than renewal he saw to his grief a period where many quit the priesthood and the religious life, the Church participation declined and serious discord spread among Catholics, clergy and bishops. In his almost 30 years as an emeritus he published four books, mainly in the field of his earlier profession, spirituality."

  "text" : "Jeffrey Amestoy (born July 24, 1946) is a former Vermont Attorney General and Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. Born in Rutland, Vermont, Amestoy received a B.A. from Hobart College in Geneva, New York, his J.D. from Hastings Law School at the University of California, and his Master of Public Administration degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1968 to 1974. A Republican, Amestoy began a career in public service when he was appointed legal counsel for the Governor's Commission on the Administration of Justice in 1974. He served as an Assistant Attorney General from 1974 to 1981. In 1982 he was appointed Vermont's Commissioner of Labor and Industry, a position he held until becoming Attorney General. In 1984 Amestoy ran successfully for Attorney General, defeating Bruce M. Lawlor in the general election. He served from 1985 to 1997, winning reelection in 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994 and 1996. On January 10, 1997, Governor Howard Dean appointed Amestoy to serve as Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, following the retirement of Frederic W. Allen, and he was succeeded as Attorney General by William Sorrell. As Chief Justice, Amestoy authored the opinion of the Vermont Supreme Court in Baker v. Vermont, 744 A.2d 864 (Vt. 1999), which held that the state's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples violated the Vermont Constitution. The court ordered the Vermont legislature to either allow same-sex marriages or implement an alternative legal mechanism according similar rights to same-sex couples. Amestoy retired from the court on June 16, 2004, and was succeeded as Chief Justice by Paul L. Reiber. Amestoy returned to the Harvard Kennedy School in 2004 as a Fellow at the Institute of Politics. He was a Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Center for Public Leadership (2005-2014) and was instrumental in initiating the Executive Session on State Court Leaders in the 21st Century, a three-year project that brought together scholars and judicial leaders to examine the distinctive role of state court leaders in our democracy. Amestoy is the author of \"The Politics of Restraint: State Judicial Leadership in the 21st Century\" one of a series of papers written by members of the executive session. Amestoy is the author of Slavish Shore: The Odyssey of Richard Henry Dana Jr. (Harvard University Press, 2015). His article \"The Supreme Court Argument that Saved the Union: Richard Henry Dana Jr. and the Prize Cases\" (Journal of Supreme Court History 2010) was awarded the Supreme Court Historical Society's Hughes-Gossett Prize."

  "text" : "Jean-Loup Gervais (born September 10, 1936 in Paris) is a French theoretical physicist. Gervais studied physics and mathematics in Paris, where he graduated in 1961 and got his Ph.D. 1965 as student of at Claude Bouchiat and Philippe Meyer in Orsay. From 1966 to 1968 he was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of New York City. Already since 1960 he was employed at the CNRS, from 1970 on as Maître de conférences. During 1973–1985 he was Maître de conférences at École polytechnique. From 1979 to 1983 and from 1995 to 1998 he was director of the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics of the École Normale Supérieure. He had been a guest professor at the City College of New York and also partly at University of California, Berkeley, at the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge (1997), at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and at University of California, Santa Barbara. Gervais worked on quantum field theory, supersymmetry and string theory. In 1969, he investigated (together with Benjamin W. Lee) renormalisability of theories of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In 1971, he presented with Bunji Sakita a supersymmetric invariant Lagrangian in the framework of a precursor of string theory, called the dual resonance models. In 1969, he calculated one-loop diagrams in the early string theory, with Daniele Amati and Bouchiat. In the beginning of the 1970s, he also studied, with Sakita, string theories as conformal field theorys in two dimensions and then soliton theories as field theories of collective excitations, e.g., in the context of WKB wave functions. In the 1980s he studied soliton (Skyrmion) models of quarks in the limit of many color degrees of freedom (large-N limit). He then also considered conformal field theories such as the Liouville field theory, string theories and two-dimensional quantum gravity from the point of view of exactly integrable systems. With André Neveu, he investigated in the 1980s also non-critical string theories. In 1997 he was awarded the highly reputed Prix Créé par l'État from the French Académie des sciences. Among his Ph.D. students are particle physicists Antal Jevicki (now professor at Brown University) and Adel Bilal."

  "text" : "James Manley, PhD, is Julian Clarence Levi Professor of Life Sciences at Columbia University, where his laboratory studies gene expression in mammalian cells. Manley and colleagues identified and characterized the key factors responsible for polyadenylation of mRNA precursors, and elucidated how this remarkably complex machinery functions in gene regulation, for example during cell growth and differentiation. He has also studied the mechanism and regulation of the process by which introns are removed from mRNA precursors, mRNA splicing. Manley and his coworkers codiscovered the first alternative splicing factor (SR protein), characterized how this and other splicing regulatory proteins function and are themselves regulated, showed how alternative splicing can become deregulated in disease, and with respect to mechanism demonstrated that two spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs by themselves have catalytic activity. Finally, he elucidated unexpected links between these mRNA processing reactions and transcription, DNA damage signaling and maintenance of genomic stability. His work has thus provided considerable insight into the complex mechanisms that are essential for the regulated production of mRNAs in mammalian cells."

A New York City native, Shanley attended Fordham University and was employed as a copyboy by The New York Times in 1937, the year he graduated with a bachelor's degree. Soon thereafter he was promoted to general assignment reporter, remaining in the position until World War II, when he took a leave of absence to enlist in the Army and serve in counterintelligence at such theaters of war as China, Burma, India and North Africa. Returning to The Times after the war, he became, in 1948, assistant editor of the drama news department and was assigned, as editor, to cover radio and television in 1954, when he also joined the faculty of his alma mater, Fordham, as a part-time professor of communications, continuing to teach there until 1961. After contributing scores of articles and reviews, mostly about various productions of 1950s and early 1960s television, he left The Times in 1963 and joined New York City's independent TV station, WOR Channel 9, as well as WOR radio, in the position of public relations director. Four years later, in 1968, he accepted the position of assistant to the president of Brooklyn's Pratt Institute which specializes in architecture, interior design and industrial design. After another three years, he moved to another of the city's institutes of higher learning, York College, a part of the City University of New York in Queens, where he remained as director of college relations until retiring in 1980. John P. Shanley was 70 years old and residing the Long Island suburb of Bellerose Village, when he died of lung cancer at the Mercy Hospice in nearby Rockville Centre. He and his wife, Regina Claire O'Brien, were the parents of five sons and two daughters."

Under redistricting legislation signed by Governor Steve Beshear, Taylor County, where Higdon was born, was immediately removed from Higdon's District 14 and placed in District 16, represented by Republican Sara Beth Gregory of Monticello in Wayne County. Higdon now has a vastly revised district: Casey, Marion, Nelson, and Spencer counties as well as a portion of Jefferson County. In addition to Taylor County and her own Wayne County, Gregory represents Adair, Clinton, Cumberland, McCreary, and Russell counties. The Kentucky Supreme Court struck down the 2012 districting on the grounds that it did not comply with the federal \"one man, one vote\" concept. Higdon said that he is \"just really, really disappointed in the way that the plan worked out, as far as my losing Taylor County.\""

During the late 1970s, Hinson began a long-running relationship with The Oak Ridge Boys as a songwriter and assisted with the operations of their publishing company. In the late 1980s he was a contestant on Star Search. \n*  Hinson released his first album as an artist, Strong Medicine, on Wrinkled Records in 2013. \n*  Hinson is openly bisexual although he has been in a monogamous relationship with his wife Brenda since the 1980s."

The Lord Provost initially found the confession implausible and took no action, but eventually Weir and his spinster sister, Jane Weir, were taken to the Edinburgh Tolbooth for interrogation. Major Weir, now in his seventies, continued to expand on his confession and Jane Weir gave an even more exaggerated history of witchcraft, sorcery and vice. The trial began on April 9, 1670. Jane Weir confessed that their mother had been a witch and had taught her children. She also revealed that Thomas bore the mark of the Beast on his body and that they frequently roamed the countryside in a fiery coach. Weir was born near Carluke in Lanarkshire."

  "text" : "Joseph Theodoor \"Joep\" Leerssen (born 12 June 1955, Leiden) is a Dutch comparatist and cultural historian. He is professor of European studies at the University of Amsterdam, where he also holds a Royal Netherlands Academy Research Professorship. He was awarded the Spinozapremie in 2008. Leerssen studied Comparative literature in Aachen (M.A. 1979) and Anglo-Irish Studies at University College Dublin (M.A. 1980), and received his doctorate from Utrecht University in 1986. He was appointed lecturer in European Studies in Amsterdam in 1986 and was given a professorial chair in the same subject in 1991. In addition, he has held guest professorships and visiting fellowships in Harvard (Erasmus Chair), Cambridge (Magdalene College) and Göttingen. He headed the, the Dutch National Research Institute for Cultural History, from 1996 until 2005. Leerssen has worked in the fields of Irish Studies, imagology and European studies. His main research focus is on the relationship between national (self-)stereotyping and nationalism, and on the historical development of cultural and romantic nationalism in nineteenth-century Europe, using literary texts as a source for the history of ideas. His books Mere Irish & Fíor-Ghael (1986, repr. 1996) and Remembrance and Imagination (1996) deal with the pre-1800 and 19th-century emergence of an Irish national identity; Imagology (co-edited with Manfred Beller, 2007) is a handbook on the literary articulation of stereotypes of national characters; National Thought in Europe a survey of the culture-historical growth of nationalism in Europe.In the field of nationalism studies, Leerssen takes up an intermediary position between the approaches of ethnosymbolism and modernism, stressing \"the long memory and the short history\" of nationalism. While emphasizing the agency of culture in the rise and spread of nationalism, he considers this culture to consist of a set of literary myths and stereotypes which only in modern times, under the influence of Romantic historicism, came to be mistaken for long-standing ethnic continuities.Additionally, national identities always take shape by opposing the nation to a (historically changeable) variety of stereotyped foreigners; Leerssen defines nationalism as the \"political instrumentalization\" of such self/other-stereotypes. Since nationalism always involves an oppositional dynamics between different societies, and can therefore never be adequately comprehended on a single-country basis, Leerssen pleads for a rigorously transnational, comparative approach.Within The Netherlands, Leerssen was involved in the official recognition of Limburgish as a regional language; he has written literary work in Limburgish. Since 2008 Leerssen is member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences."

  "text" : "John Joseph Shillinglaw FRGS, (30 September 1831 – 26 May 1905), was a public servant, author and historian in Australia. Shillinglaw was born in London, the eldest son of John Shillinglaw and his wife Emma Nicholas, née Taylor. John senior (who died in 1862) was librarian of the Royal Geographical Society. Along with his father and brothers, John Joseph emigrated to Victoria, arriving in October 1852. Shillinglaw was employed in the Government service at intervals from that time. In 1856 he was selected as Government Shipping Master, to administer certain of the Imperial laws relating to seamen, then just adopted in Victoria, and in this position he remained until, on a general reduction in the departments in 1869, he retired from the Civil Service with compensation. He was reappointed to the Civil Service in 1875, and successively held the appointments of Secretary to the Police Superannuation and Police Medical Boards, and the Central Board of Health. He was Secretary to the Royal Commission on Vegetable Products. In 1870 Shillinglaw became proprietor and editor of the Colonial Monthly magazine. He published \"Arctic Discovery\" in 1850, and in 1865 edited \"Cast Away on the Aucklands,\" a book which the Times said was as interesting as Robinson Crusoe. In 1858 he compiled a \"Shipmaster's Guide,\" for Victorian mariners. Some early annals of the colony, which he discovered in 1878, were printed by Parliament under the title of \"Historical Records of Port Phillip.\""

  "text" : "John de Rednesse (died after 1386) was an English born judge who served four times as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. He was the son of Stephen de Rednesse, whose family took its name from the village of Reedness in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He is first heard of in 1327 when he received a royal pardon for killing one of his servants. Between 1335 and 1342 he served as Commissioner for the Peace in Yorkshire. He came to Ireland in 1344 as a justice of the King's Bench. In 1346 he was appointed Lord Chief Justice; he was later demoted to second justice, and then reappointed Chief Justice. In all he served four terms as Lord Chief Justice. Such rapid changes of personnel on the medieval Irish bench were not uncommon, but they normally resulted from a clash between rival for office; in Rednesse's case, unusually, he was replaced on each occasion by a different man. In his later years a rival did emerge in the person of Richard de Wirkeley, Prior of the Order of Hospitallers, who was appointed Chief Justice in 1356, but he was quickly replaced by Rednesse, and ordered by King Edward III not to intermeddle with the office. Rednesse was finally removed from office in 1361. He returned to England, where he spent his later years in his native Yorkshire. He served on a Commissioner for the Peace in 1374. In 1386, by which time he must have been well advanced in years, he was one of several local landowners who were asked to conduct an inquiry into the illegal digging of a watercourse in the Holderness region, which was causing a nuisance."

The bridge and buildings were slightly downstream of the river's lowermost waterfall, a traditional fishing spot for the native inhabitants of the region. Sherar improved the bridge and about 60 miles (97 km) of the existing wagon road that crossed it. He and his wife, Jane, operated the Sherar Bridge Hotel from 1871 until their deaths in 1907–08. A concrete bridge has since replaced Sherar's wooden bridge and carries Oregon Route 216 over the river near the waterfall."

  "text" : "Julie Rayne is a British singer and entertainer, noted for her television appearances and recordings from the early 1960s. Rayne was born in Darlington and was educated at the Darlington High School for Girls. Rayne started out at the Darlington Hippodrome as soubrette with Geordie comic Bobby Thompson in the Merry Magpies review. When the show closed, she moved to London and soon found work in the Soho music clubs. Her first big break came when she was asked to join Dr Crock and the Crackpots' comedy show band. She performed briefly as Julie James and Julie Jones until signed by Norman Newell at HMV, who settled on the name Julie Rayne. Her fourth record, 'Green With Envy, Purple With Passion, White With Anger, Scarlet With Fever, What Were You Doing in Her Arms Last Night Blues?' entered the Guinness Book of Records for the longest song title. She became well-known through frequent appearances on British television, most notably as one of the resident singers on the first series of Stars and Garters which was voted best light entertainment series on television in the same year (1963) and on radio shows such as Sing it Again and Saturday Club. She was backed by the top outfits of the day, including the Alan Ainsworth, Tony Osborne and John Barry Orchestras, appeared at top venues such as the Royal Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall. This was an interesting period for Julie, meeting and working with many of the top names in music, comedy and variety. Having already worked with Sir Cliff Richard, she was intrigued to hear him speak at a Billy Graham meeting and this triggered her interest in wanting to know more. A hiatus in her career eventually followed while she spent a brief period as a missionary and then as a student, obtaining a degree and teaching qualification at London University. When she returned to show business full-time, she added additional strings to her bow. As a stage actress, she appeared in numerous productions, including straight theatre as well as musicals, reviews and pantomime. She has also been a director and producer as well as a mentor and model. Her later performances often include one Christian song as an expression of her faith. Minister Fred B. Craddock mentions in his book an instance in Germany where Rayne performed a version of Psalm 121 amongst popular songs from the 1940s through to the 1960s. Craddock asked to meet with Rayne after a performance and wondered why Rayne chose to include a Christian song in her performance. Rayne answered that she 'had made a promise to God to include a song of praise in every performance.' Already a published writer, she has just completed the manuscript of a novel loosely based on her own experiences entering showbiz. Though she has not appeared on television since 2000, or radio since 2012, Julie is still an active singer."

Tobin in 1946, and was re-elected to this post at every subsequent Teamsters convention until his death in February 1969 at the age of 80. The organisation itself described English as the \"greatest Secretary-Treasurer\" it had encountered. English was noted for being a Teamsters official who maintained a reputation for integrity, and who had openly opposed union president Dave Beck but he also vocally defended Beck's successor, Jimmy Hoffa, and other Teamsters officials who faced accusations of corruption. Robert F. Kennedy, in his 1960 book about union corruption, The Enemy Within, noted that \"no question has ever been raised about John English's integrity\" but also described his disappointment after English praised Hoffa at the 1957 Teamsters convention."

  "text" : "Janet Leys Shaw Mactavish (1925–1972) was a Canadian architect notable for her innovative design of schools and university buildings. Among her noteworthy works are two circular university buildings: Stirling Hall, the physics building at Queen's University in Ontario (1962); and the McIntyre Medical Sciences Building at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec (1965). She was a graduate of McGill University's School of Architecture. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Mactavish worked for the architectural firm Marshall and Merrett. She was a colleague and friend of architect Dorice Walford. Mactavish designed many schools, including Beaconsfield High School (1958), Valois Park and Lakeside Heights (now École Pointe-Claire) on the West Island of Montreal. Her Modern designs and published ideas were known for their application of pedagogy to architectural planning of schools, for cost savings from the reduction of exterior walls, and for the focus on reduction of indoor congestion and corridor traffic between classes. \"Mactavish's schools and U- and L- shaped structures . . . illustrate the rational, economic planning ideas popular in the 1950s. Her major idea to decrease costs was to reduce the amount of space given over to circulation.\""

  "text" : "Jazmine Fenlator (born August 29, 1985) is an American bobsledder who was one of three pilots of the U.S. Olympic Bobsled team for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Fenlator grew up in Wayne, New Jersey and graduated from Wayne Valley High School. She is a majority member of the International Order of the Rainbow for Girls in New Jersey. Fenlator became involved in the sport of bobsled in September 2007. Fenlator graduated from Rider University with a bachelor's degree in multimedia communications and advertising. At Rider, Jazmine competed on the track and field team specializing in shot put, discus and hammer. Upon graduating from Rider in 2007, Fenlator’s track coach suggested she try a bobsled camp. In 2011, Jazmine's family nearly lost their home in Hurricane Irene. After spending a few years as a brakeman, Fenlator decided to make the switch to the driver’s seat. In only her third season as a pilot, she has already earned two World Cup medals – silver in Lake Placid, N.Y., and bronze in Igls, Austria. Jazmine was named as one of three pilots of the U.S. Olympic Bobsled team for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

  "text" : "John Anderson Gilfillan (19 September 1821 – 1 February 1875) was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council. Gilfillan was born in Torry in Torryburn, Fifeshire, Scotland in 1821. He was educated at the Grammar School at Cullen in Banffshire. He moved to Liverpool in November 1837 to join a firm of merchants. After a year, he was promoted to the firm's head office in London. After his health deteriorated through lung disease, he moved back to Scotland in 1845. After his health did not recover, he sought advice from Sir James Clark, 1st Baronet, the Queen Victoria's physician, who recommended a change in climate and relocation to either Egypt or New Zealand. Towards the end of 1846, he left for New Zealand on the Victoria. After a short period in Wellington, he briefly returned to England for business arrangements, and then settled in Auckland, where he arrived on 17 April 1849. His brother Robert had emigrated to Auckland just before him. The brothers set themselves up as merchants and commission agents. On 3 June 1852 at St Paul's Church, Gilfillan married Gertrude Anne Eliza Davies, the eldest daughter of colonial surgeon William Davies. They were to have five sons and three daughters. Gilfillan was one of the original six appointees from Auckland to the Legislative Council. He was appointed on 6 May 1854 and served until 2 August 1861 when he resigned; then 12 July 1862 to 23 April 1866 when he again resigned. He was voted onto the Auckland Provincial Council. He represented the Suburbs of Auckland electorate in the first council, from 20 July 1853 until 25 September 1855. He then represented the Auckland West electorate in the fifth council from 2 May 1867 until 27 May 1868. He was a member of the executive council for three period (14 March 1854 – 21 January 1855; 8 April 1864 – 4 November 1864; 6 May 1867 – 6 February 1868) and during some of that time, he was Provincial Secretary. Gilfillan died on 1 February 1875 from chronic bronchitis, aged 53 years."

  "text" : "James Marshall (1843 – 9 October 1912) was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council. Marshall was born in 1843 in Scotland. In New Zealand, he first lived in Southland. The West Coast Gold Rush brought him to the West Coast, and he lived in the mining communities of Granville, Orwell Creek, and Nobbs. About 1880, he settled at nearby Totara Flat, a settlement on the Grey River, where he was a farmer. He had previously been a packer, butcher, and publican. He was a member of the Grey County Council from its inception in 1877 until his death. On 28 November 1888, he was first elected chairman of the Grey Council. He chaired the county council for the years 1889, 1900, and 1909. He was a member of the Grey Education Board for 26 years until his death, and for many years served as its chairman. He was a member of the Legislative Council from 18 April 1902 to 17 April 1909; then 17 April 1909 to 9 October 1912, when he died. He was appointed by the Liberal Government under Richard Seddon, who as a fellow West Coaster knew him well. He succeeded James Kerr, who had died on 25 August 1901. James Holmes of Hokitika, another West Coaster, received his call to the Legislative Council on the same day as Marshall. Marshall died at home in Totara Flat, and was survived by his wife Annie, one son, and one daughter. He was buried at Ahaura Cemetery in one of the largest funerals that the West Coast has ever seen, and that despite a special train that was to be scheduled from Greymouth not running. The funeral procession was one or two miles long."

In 1865 Mr. Smith constructed the railway from Toowoomba to Warwick, Queensland and afterwards became chief engineering surveyor of the Railway Surveys Department, and surveyed Cooktown and the interior with a view to possible railway construction. In 1873 he was appointed by the Arthur Macalister Administration Chief Engineer of the South and West Railway system, and was Acting Chief Engineer for twelve months, during the absence of Mr. Stanley, who then held that post. He then acted as Deputy Engineer-in-chief of the South and West Railways until the abolition of the office by the Samuel Griffith Ministry in July 1884.

  "text" : "John Sherman (May 10, 1823 – October 22, 1900) was an American Republican representative and senator from Ohio during the Civil War and into the late nineteenth century. He also served as both Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of State. Sherman ran for the Republican presidential nomination three times, coming closest in 1888, but never won. His brothers included General William Tecumseh Sherman, Charles Taylor Sherman, a federal judge in Ohio, and Hoyt Sherman, an Iowa banker. Born in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman later moved to Mansfield, Ohio, where he began a law career before entering politics. Initially a Whig, Sherman was among those anti-slavery activists who formed what became the Republican Party. He served three terms in the House of Representatives. As a member of the House, Sherman traveled to Kansas to investigate the unrest between pro- and anti-slavery partisans there. He rose in party leadership and was nearly elected Speaker in 1859. Sherman was elevated to the Senate in 1861. As a senator, he was a leader in financial matters, helping to redesign the United States' monetary system to meet the needs of a nation torn apart by civil war. After the war, he worked to produce legislation that would restore the nation's credit abroad and produce a stable, gold-backed currency at home. Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the administration of Rutherford B. Hayes, Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and solvency, overseeing an end to wartime inflationary measures and a return to gold-backed money. He returned to the Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating laws on immigration, business competition law, and the regulation of interstate commerce. Sherman was the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him unable to handle the burdens of the job, and he retired in 1898 at the start of the Spanish–American War. Sherman died at his home in Washington, D.C. in 1900."

He accompanied the Justiciar of Ireland, Ralph d'Ufford, to Ireland in 1344 and became a justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). The following year he became Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, but served for only a year, and returned to England soon afterwards. He married Margaret (or Margery) de Wolverton, daughter and co-heiress of Sir John de Wolverton of Wolverton. They had one daughter, Joan, who married John Longueville of Billing, Northamptonshire. Le Hunt was still alive in 1351 when, on the death of her brother Ralph, Margaret and her sister Joan inherited the Wolverton estates; these passed to John and Margaret's daughter Joan, and thus into the Longueville family, who remained at Wolverton until 1712. After Hunt's death his widow remarried three times: firstly to Roger de Louth, then Richard Imworth, and finally John Howes; but she is not known to have had any further children by her later marriages."

  "text" : "Jacques-Nicolas Gobert (1 June 1760 – 17 July 1808) was a French general who was killed in action in Spain during the Peninsular War. He set out from Madrid with a division on 2 July 1808 to join General Dupont in Jaén. Defeating the insurgents who attacked his troops in the Sierra Morena, he and General Lefranc passed the Puerta del Rey, where he left a battalion, on 15 July 15, and reached Bailén with only one brigade, as the remainder of his troops was needed to hold the road north through the mountains against the guerrillas. During the Battle of Bailén, after joining General Liger-Belair on the road between Bailén and Mengíbar, he was wounded by a ball to the head while rallying his troops. He died in Guarromán on the night of 16 to 17 July. Gobert was a friend of Dupont's, having served on his staff in Tuscany, and had requested the transfer of his division from General Moncey's corps to that of Dupont."

  "text" : "James Johnstone (26 June 1815 – 21 October 1878) was a British newspaper proprietor. He was born in London, the son of a Bankruptcy Court messenger, who he succeeded in 1842. In 1861 he became head of Johnstone, Cooper, Wintle, & Co., managers in chancery, bankrupts' accountants, and public auditors. In 1857 he bought the newspaper interests of Charles Baldwin, proprietor of the Morning Herald and the Standard for £16,500. The daily circulation of the Standard had fallen to 700 and the business was in financial difficulty. With the help of publisher John Maxwell, for a while his partner in the new enterprise, Johnstone re-issued the Standard as a morning paper on 29 June 1857, reducing its price to twopence and doubling its size to eight large pages. On the same date he also started a high-priced Evening Herald and continued to print the Morning Herald as a fourpenny paper. On 4 February 1858 the price of the Standard was reduced to a penny and an evening issue of the paper revived on 11 June 1860. The Evening Herald was terminated on 27 May 1865 and the Morning Herald on 31 December 1869. The Evening Standard was reformatted 1 January 1870 under the editorship of Charles Williams and in that year reached a circulation figure of 100,000 copies per day. By 1869 Johnstone had repaid all his debts and was sole proprietor of the business. He died at Hooley House, Coulsdon, Surrey in 1878 and was buried in Coulsdon. He had been married twice, and had children by each marriage. One son, James Johnstone, junior, edited the Standard from 1872 to 1877."

There he bred Invershin and Inkerman, both bay colts by the sire Invincible and both high class stayers. Invershin won back-to-back Gold Cups at Ascot in 1928 and 1929, and other good races including successive victories in the Caledonian Hunt and a Derby Cup. Inkerman's two most notable wins were in the 1923 Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket and the 1924 Chester Vase. He was a Justice of the Peace for Staffordshire and was appointed High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1817–18. He married Katherine Howard, daughter of John Cartland. They had two sons and two daughters."

  "text" : "Joseph Parsons, Jr. (1647-1729) was an early settler and prominent colonial leader in Northampton, Massachusetts. Parsons, Jr. was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on November 1, 1647. His father, Cornet Joseph Parsons, Sr., immigrated to America from England around 1635, and was one of the witnesses to the deed that transferred ownership of Springfield from the Native Americans to the English settlers. He later became one of the original settlers of Northampton, Massachusetts. Parson, Jr.'s mother, Mary (Bliss) Parsons was accused of witchcraft several decades before the far more notorious Salem Witch Trials, although she was ultimately acquitted. Parsons, Jr. lived most of his life in Northampton. On March 17, 1669, he married Elizabeth Strong, the daughter of John Strong, the lead elder of the church and prominent resident of the town. Parsons, Jr. was involved in several business enterprises in and around Northampton, including grist mills, sawmills, and iron. He later became active in politics; in 1696, he was commissioned as one of the four judges on the Hampshire County Court of Common Pleas, which at the time included all of Western Massachusetts. He served in this capacity until 1719. Parsons, Jr. also served as a representative in the Massachusetts General Court; he represented Springfield in 1706 and 1708, and Northampton from 1711-1715, 1717, 1721, and 1724. In addition, he held several other minor offices; in 1700, he was appointed as the first town moderator in Northampton history, and he also served as justice of the peace for a number of years. Throughout most of Parson, Jr.'s life in Northampton, Solomon Stoddard was the pastor of the church. However, by 1725 Stoddard was 82 years old and unable to fulfill all of his pastoral duties alone. So, the town voted seven members onto a committee to find a suitable candidate to assist, and upon Stoddard's death, replace him as pastor. Joseph Parsons, Jr. was one of the members of this pastoral search committee, which ultimately chose Jonathan Edwards, whose tenure as pastor would lead to the Great Awakening. Joseph Parsons, Jr. died in Northampton in November, 1729."

After wartime service with the Royal Hampshire Regiment he joined the Metropolitan Police in 1946. By the early 1970s he was the Commander of the Fraud Squad . He was promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissionerand it was in this role that on 19 July 1972 he began the Poulson investigation. At the time this was the UK's biggest ever corruption inquiry: it eventually led to the resignation of Reginald Maudling, then Home Secretary and notionally in charge of the police. In 1973 Crane arrested Poulson who was later convicted. In 1980 James Crane was involved in important events once more. The Yorkshire Ripper case was no nearer being solved than when the murders had begun five years earlier. Following the murder of Jacqueline Hill on Tuesday, November 18, 1980 Home Secretary William Whitelaw and several senior officials were told to present themselves in Margaret Thatcher's office to find a way forward. The Prime Minister said that the local police had so far failed totally in their enquiries into the series of violent murders. It had become a question of public confidence. Crane was summoned and warned that drastic action was immediately required. Crane immediately briefed a senior Inspectorate colleague, Lawrence Byford, and told him to get to the headquarters of the West Yorkshire Police first thing in the morning and do whatever he thought necessary. In 1977 he was awarded CBE.  On Wednesday, 23 July 1980, at Buckingham Palace, the Queen conferred the Honour of Knighthood."

  "text" : "Jules Fejer (January 22, 1914 – December 21, 2002) was a Hungarian physicist. Fejer was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary. In the late 1950s he wrote a fundamental paper on incoherent backscatter, explaining why the width of the backscattered echo was determined primarily by the ion thermal velocity rather than by the electron thermal velocity. He was one of a group of ionospheric physicists brought together by Henry G. Booker to start what became the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of California, San Diego. He was elected a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union in 1990 and continued work with graduate students until 1995."

He married Wynifred Mary Evans, a kindergarten teacher in the Montessori style, on 9 July 1914; they would have four children. During World War I he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps as a major, and he was appointed deputy assistant director of medical services to the Second and Fourth Armies and the Army of the Rhine. He was recognised for his work combating typhoid fever with an OBE and a French decoration. Shortly after the war Dale received his Doctorate of Medicine and migrated to Australia, arriving in Perth in February 1920 to become medical officer of health and assistant inspector of hospitals. He remained in Western Australia until 1927, when he was appointed medical officer of health for the City of Melbourne. From 1929 he also lectured at the University of Melbourne on public health, and he served on the British Medical Association's Victorian council (president 1945). In February 1951 he was divorced; on 7 March that year he married Dr Hilda Bull, after which he and his wife left for the Netherlands. Dale worked as a medical officer for the Australian government, examining potential migrants. On 27 September 1952 he was killed in a car accident at Venice. He is buried near Verona."

  "text" : "Jack Green (18 June 1925 – 5 September 2014) was a geologist and geology professor at California State University Long Beach. His active research included general volcanology and economic geology, as well as mineralogy, lunar protolife, lunar volcanism, water on the moon and astrobiology. His passion for volcanology and the moon was primarily in trying to prove that lunar craters were volcanic and not asteroid impacts, and therefore, there would be water on the moon which would support life. He collaborated with Urey, Shoemaker, Kuiper and others during the \"Space Age\" heyday, and was active in planning several conferences on remote sensing and the moon. Jack Green was best known for his 1971 book, co-edited with Nicholas Short, Volcanic landforms and surface features, a photographic atlas and glossary. Later (2010) publications included Implications for Lunar Volcanism and Proto-Life Based on Discoveries of Lunar Water andthe (2011) paper Academic Aspects of Lunar Water Resources and Their Relevance to Lunar Protolife."

  "text" : "Joseph J. Barzda (May 22, 1915 – October 11, 1993) was an American racing driver from New Brunswick, New Jersey. Barzda was primarily a midget racing and sprint car racing driver but made ten starts in the USAC National Championship from 1952 to 1959. His best race finish was a pair of fourth places in 1958 at Springfield and Trenton. He finished 18th in the 1958 National Championship. He unsuccessfully attempted to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 in 1951, 1952, and 1953. He retired after he was involved in a crash at Williams Grove Speedway in 1959 where Van Johnson died. Barzda survived with minor injuries. In 1958 and 1959, Barzda was noted for fielding a Chevrolet-powered sprint car at a time when nearly all competitive sprint cars had Offenhauser engines. He and his brother Jim owned California Speed Shop in New Brunswick, New Jersey and continued to field racing cars after Joe's retirement from the cockpit."

  "text" : "John Busuttil Leaver is a visual artist from the Mediterranean Island Republic of Malta. He studied art under Harry Alden at the Government School of art, then by attending The Art and Design Centre which today is known as the MCAST Institute of Art & Design. Drawing and oil painting are his preferred media. He is philosophical about his work and sees what he does as non-commercial: a statement about the contemporary and its preservation for posterity. He has been culturally active by participating in many collectives. He spent some years writing about contemporary art in the press.His first important one-man exhibition was held at the National Museum of Fine Arts, Valletta, Malta in 1997. Other one-man shows followed in various galleries and art venues. His largest show named 'A Diary of Obsessions', was held in 2008, at the prestigious Saint James Cavalier Centre for Creativity in Valletta. In April 2014 he exhibited work in London. His work was given recognition by a number of art critics and curators. He was included in Nicholas de Piro's, Dictionary of Artists who painted Malta, and in Michael J. Schiavone's, \"Dictionary of Maltese Biographies\".Art critics, Emanuel Fiorentino, Dominic Cutajar, Dennis Vella, Adrian Stivala and Raphael Vella covered his exhibitions. Art curator Dr Louis Lagana gave the inaugural speech for the 2008 show and published an article about this work. The Times ran a major feature about this exhibition. It had also published two full page interviews on previous occasions. A Maltese language annual featured a painting on its front cover.He won a number of art competitions and was featured in radio and TV programmes most noteworthy of which was a Canadian TV Cultural programme, 'TV Frames', during their feature on Malta."

  "text" : "John Hunt (1775 – 7 September 1848) was an English printer, publisher, and occasional political writer. He was an elder brother of the poet and essayist Leigh Hunt and a brother of the critic Robert Hunt. Hunt was born in Philadelphia, the fourth of eight children (five of whom survived to adulthood) born to Isaac Hunt and Mary Hunt. He was taken to London in or about 1777. On 1 February 1791 he was apprenticed to the printer Henry Reynell. Known as a staunch, outspoken, and uncompromising radical, Hunt was more than once imprisoned for his publication of items that were considered libelous, even seditious. John Hunt was responsible for various periodicals over the years, all of them politically left-leaning. His first publishing venture, in 1805 (after a failed beginning the year before), was the eight-page weekly newspaper The News. This was followed by The Reflector, the Yellow Dwarf, The Liberal, and, the most famous and influential, The Examiner, edited by his brother Leigh Hunt. He was also known for publishing radical or controversial works no one else would touch. Among the miscellany, including one book by Jeremy Bentham, there were others more obviously incendiary or scandalous, such as some of Byron's later works, including The Vision of Judgment, Hazlitt's Liber Amoris, and writings of both Percy and Mary Shelley. Although Hunt was closely attached to, and a frequent collaborator with, his younger brother Leigh, there was a period of many years, beginning in 1825, during which the brothers were not on speaking terms. They were finally reconciled in 1840. Hunt and his wife Sally had at least two sons, one of whom, Henry Leigh Hunt, eventually took over many publishing and editing responsibilities from his father. John Hunt spent his last decades retired to Upper Chaddon near Taunton, Somerset. After many years in poor health, he died in Brompton, Middlesex, on 7 September 1848."

Du Plessis' bizarre 320-page manuscript is illustrated with hand-coloured drawings by the author himself. These include \"John Grimes, a Dwarf\", \"Two Sisters conjoined\", \"A Woman Seven foot High\", \"A Woman with a Hog's Face\", \"A Spotted Negro Prince\" and \"The Monstrous Tartar\". The section headed \"A Wild Girl found Near Chalons in Champagne\" contains the earliest-known report in English of Marie-Angélique Memmie Le Blanc, the famous feral child of 18th-century France. Shortly before his death, Du Plessis offered the manuscript and its illustrations to Sir Hans Sloane and they became part of Sloane's foundation collection of the British Museum. Du Plessis' fascination with human strangeness and prodigies of all kinds began in his youth when he dug up the body of a stillborn two-headed child, a cousin, in the garden of his family home at Pithiviers in north-central France."

The next year he defeated Julius Wulf, but was himself defeated by Searle in a very toughly fought contest. In 1890 Stanbury twice defeated O'Connor, the American champion, who the year previously had been beaten by Searle on the Thames, in each case over the Parramatta course. On 29 April he defeated John McLean, another New South Wales sculler, over the same course for the championship of the world. In 1892 he also beat Tom Sullivan, the New Zealand sculler, over the Parramatta course. In 1905, Stanbury regained the world championship."

  "text" : "Jesse Fish (1724 or 1726–1790) was a shipmaster, merchant, and realtor who lived in St. Augustine, Florida under both Spanish and British rule, and is infamous in the town's history to this day. He was a schemer involved in contraband trade and illegal real estate deals, and operated as a slaver, smuggler, and usurer. By his slaver activities Fish introduced most of the bozales, or African-born slaves, registered in Spanish Florida during the decade (1752–1763) preceding Spain's cession of Florida to Great Britain. He has been accused of spying for England and Spain as a double agent during the Seven Years’ War, but there is no evidence to support the claim. Little is known about Jesse Fish’s life, although records of some of his business associations and dealings exist. He was born in Newtown on Long Island in New York, where his ancestors had acquired substantial property in the 1600s. His father, Capt. Thomas Fish, married Elizabeth Kip, daughter of Jesse Kip of Newtown, in 1717. Jesse was born in 1724 or 1726, and arrived in St. Augustine in 1736 at the age of ten or twelve, sent there by William Walton, Sr., New York's most successful merchant, probably aboard a Walton Company sloop captained by his uncle Abraham Kip. Kip made at least twenty passages between New York and St. Augustine from 1732 to 1739."

Northfield is best known as the designer of a series of posters for the Australian National Travel Association promoting Australian holiday destinations to local and overseas travellers. Many of these 'Travel Poster' designs were included in the 1999-2000 exhibition \"Follow the Sun - Australian travel posters 1930s–1950s\" at the National Library of Australia, and in various other public exhibitions. Northfield also created a series of patriotic posters during World War II. A detailed monograph of Northfield's work, James Northfield and the Art of Selling Australia, has been completed by author Michelle Hetherington of the National Museum of Australia. Today the James Northfield Heritage Art Trust is the legal copyright owner of his designs."

After the war he was seen as no longer useful, and too closely connected to the discredited North Administration, and was denied his expected title and compensation.

Togelius has introduced core procedural generation paradigms and frameworks for game content such as the Experience-driven Procedural Content Generation (EDPCG) framework  and the Search-based Procedural Content Generation (SBPCG) paradigm  which define two of the leading research trends within procedural content generation. EDPCG couples player experience modelling and procedural content generation so that game content is generated in a personalised manner for affecting the experience of the player and SBPCG offers a taxonomy for the generation of game content through search. He co-edited the first book on Procedural Content Generation  for games. Togelius' research has appeared in respected international media such as New Scientist, and Le Monde."

  "text" : "James \"Jim\" Deren owned and operated the Angler's Roost, a well-known fishing-tackle shop in New York City, for over forty years. The many notable clients of the Roost included Ted Williams, Benny Goodman, Bing Crosby, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Deren invented several flies, such as The Fifty Degrees and Deren's Fox Dry Fly, and he was well known to anglers as a good source of information. He was a guest on \"The Sportsman's Guide\", a television show that ran for 26 weeks on the DuMont Television Network, and a technical panelist on the radio show \"The Rod and Gun Club of the Air\". Deren began tying flies in grade school in New Jersey and sold his flies in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. He started out as a fishing-tackle buyer for a shop in Newark and then worked for Alex Taylor and Company in New York City. He then became a buyer and salesman for Kirkland Brothers, where he advised clients on the technical aspects of fly-fishing and handled their fly-tying material. At that time he also began selling flytying material through a mail-order business he ran at night. This side business led him to quit his job at Kirkland Brothers and open the first Angler's Roost at 207 East Forty-third St., between 2nd and 3rd Ave, which later moved to the basement of the Chrysler Building and then the East Forty-fourth St location on the third floor of 141 East Forty-fourth St. near Grand Central Station. Deren was a first-rate angler and well known raconteur in the world of flyfishing. One of his notable quotes was posted in his shop: \"There don't have to be a thousand fish in a river; let me locate a good one and I'll get a thousand dreams out of him before I catch him—and, if I catch him, I'll turn him loose.\" He worked at the Roost until shortly before his death in 1983. In 1985, a tag sale and auction of his remaining merchandise was held for two days at Bedford Historical Hall in Bedford Village, NY."

  "text" : "Josef Franz Freyn (7 December 1845, Prague – 16 January 1903, Prague-Smíchov) was an Austrian civil engineer and botanist. He was the son of the Austrian forester Josef Freyn from Obecnic. In 1856-1862 he attended the Oberrealschule in Prague. After that, he studied at the technical Polytechnic (technische Hochschule) in Prague, but interrupted his study for a placement in forestry. In 1865-1867 he studied engineering at the technical Polytechnic (technische Hochschule) in Vienna. Afterwards he was employed in the construction of railways in Hungary and later worked in Istria (1874–1878), and in the meantime conducted investigations of regional flora. In 1878 he relocated to Opočno, later returning to Prague (1881), where he owned a construction company. As a botanist Freyn was self-taught — he reportedly never attended a formal lecture on botany. In addition to research of Hungarian and Istrian flora, he processed botanical collections from the Iberian peninsula, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Turkestan et al. As a botanical collector he collaborated with Joseph Friedrich Nicolaus Bornmüller, Eduard Hackel, Paul Sintenis. and J. J. Manissadijan Freyn is remembered for his specialized studies of individual plant species, especially those within the genera Ranunculus and Hieracium. An obituary was published by Eduard Hackel."

Lee is the son of former Yuanta Financial Holding Co board member Lee Yueh-tsang, and known for his presence at attending fashion parties and nightclubs. In 2011 two sisters filed police report against Lee. During the investigation, the police discovered recorded files on Lee's computer and arrested him in November 2012. Prosecutors said that since August 20009, Lee had been drugging women or getting them drunk in luxury nightclubs around Taiwan, before taking them to his home to rape them while unconscious. Lee fled Taipei and was on the run for 23 days before turning himself in.  Lee was originally charged with sexually assaulting 28 women and filming the acts, but the court eventually proceeded with 9 charges of rape and 15 charges of filming the women during sex acts without their consent. In the first sentencing at the Taipei district court, Lee was originally to be jailed for 22 years and had to pay compensation of NT$14.25 million to the victims. On September 2, 2014, following an appeal, Lee's sentence was increased to 80 year jail sentence for his offences. However, he would only have to serve 30 years as that was the maximum punishment for those charges by law.. He was also ordered to pay NT$27.75 million compensation to victims."

Little if anything is known of his life and career, he was possibly a minor Tudor official, but he is chiefly remembered for his surviving portrait which is displayed at Killerton House, the earliest surviving image of an Acland and the most cherished in that family's former collection, now owned by the National Trust. He was seated at Acland Barton in the parish of Landkey, near Barnstaple in North Devon, which had been the family's seat since 1155. The Acland family is believed to have migrated to England from Flanders soon after the Norman Conquest and were in the late 20th century probably the oldest surviving landed family in Devon, which by the 19th century possessed a huge estate in the West Country of almost 40,000 acres."

He was the brother of banker Ludwig von Stieglitz (1779-1843) and uncle to poet Heinrich Wilhelm Stieglitz (1801-1849). Initially a philosophy student in Berlin, he later studied medicine at the University of Göttingen. In 1789 he moved to Hanover as a physician, successively serving as Hofmedikus (from 1802, court physician), Leibmedikus (from 1806), Hofrat (from 1820, councillor) and Obermedizinalrat and director of Hanover medical colleges (1832). Known for his criticism of perceived \"heresies of medicine\", he was a vigorous opponent of speculative medical theories that included mesmerism and the Brunonian system. The following are a list of his principal published works: \n*  Versuch einer Prüfung und Verbesserung der jetzt gewöhnlichen Behandlungsart des Scharlachfiebers, 1807 - Essay on how to improve the testing and treatment of scarlet fever. \n*  Ueber den thierischen Magnetismus, 1814 - About animal magnetism. \n*  Pathologische Untersuchungen, 1832 - Pathological studies.  \n*  Ueber die Homöopathie, 1835 - In regards to homeopathy."

  "text" : "Ann Juliet Ace (born 27 June 1938) is a dramatist and playwright who wrote for EastEnders and The District Nurse. She has contributed many original scripts and dramatisations to BBC Radio drama, including The Archers. Her screenplay for the Welsh film Cameleon saw the movie win the Golden Spire Award for Best Dramatic Television Feature at the 1998 San Francisco International Film Festival. Juliet Ace was the third daughter of Charles and Glenys Ace, born and raised in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire in South Wales. She was educated at Llanelli Girls’ Grammar School, City of Coventry Training College (which was soon to become Coventry College of Education and be incorporated into the University of Warwick), where she specialised in Drama and Art, and then trained at Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama. She taught for three years in St Mary Cray before joining a children’s theatre and then working in The Grand Theatre, Swansea for two seasons, in weekly repertory. In 1964, she began to work in Special Education, working with children with special needs. After her marriage to Richard Alexander in 1966 she moved to Dartmouth in Devon where her husband worked as a civilian lecturer in The Britannia Royal Naval College. For the next 18 years she brought up their two children, Daniel Alexander (now a business consultant) and Catherine Alexander, now a theatre director and drama teacher. At the same time, Ace continued working with special needs children, privately and in local schools, and directed and acted with local drama groups. She began writing plays in 1976 after taking part in an Arvon Foundation Writing Course. In 1979 Ace won a Gulbenkian Foundation/Arts Council of Great Britain Award to work with professional directors and actors on new writing. As a result of this workshop her first play,  was produced first as a stage play in Bristol and then as a radio play, directed by Enyd Williams. It was nominated for a Pye Award After her early work in radio she moved into television, where she worked with Julia Smith and Tony Holland and was taken from The District Nurse series to the creation of the BBC’s EastEnders and then to the short-lived expatriate soap opera Eldorado. While her dramatic imagination is rich – a leading character in the radio play  is a parrot – her background in life is also significant. Two successful sequences of radio dramas are uncommonly open semi-autobiographical journeys: first there is young Mattie Jones, growing up in South Wales, who appears as a child in , set in 1946, and then completes her growth into a teenager in 1955, four plays later, in . An older Mattie, liberated by writing and performed by Patricia Hodge in four plays, starting with , and concluding with Upside Down in the Roasting Tin, is a testament to experience. Her other radio plays include , , ,  and . Her dramatisations for radio include , , and Lynne Reid Banks's . Juliet Ace tutored theatre undergraduates at Dartington College of Arts, as a visiting playwright, 1985-1987, and tutored post-graduate students of writing and directing at Goldsmiths’ College, in the Media and Communications Department, from 1995-2005. She served as a judge of the Koestler Awards, for writing by prisoners, in the 1990s and is a BAFTA jury member. (Ace was also part of an answer in a Trivial Pursuit Quiz Machine in a pub in Southend, Essex: Question. What links Ace, Bravo and Mills? Answer: they were all Juliet.) In 1988, her play A Slight Hitch was included in the Oxford University Press collection, New Plays, Volume 1edited by Peter Terson, which included plays by Terson, Arnold Wesker and Henry Livings. As described by the publisher: ‘The plays are particularly suitable for GCSE course work. Each play is accompanied by a short preamble, and there is a follow-up section consisting of biographical notes on the playwrights and ideas for discussion, improvization and follow-up work. Each play has been specially written for the series.’ Ace’s book about the actor Terence Rigby, Rigby Shlept Here: A Memoir of Terence Rigby 1937-2008, was published in November, 2014, and the actor and director Peter Eyre described it in his review as ‘a fascinating and unusual memoir of a fascinating and unusual actor ... There is an unknown and detailed documentation of his work with Pinter, Peter Hall and Ian McKellen, among others, some of it quite shocking’. It includes diary entries from Ace covering decades of her friendship with Rigby, interviews with colleagues such as Michael Gambon, and letters and extracts from an attempted autobiography by Rigby, interrupted by his early death. Juliet Ace lives in London. In September 2014 she was made a Fellow of the renamed Rose Bruford College of Theatre & Performance, in a ceremony which also made Katie Mitchell and Jenny Sealey Honorary Fellows."

  "text" : "Jonathan Coleman is the Professor of Chemical Physics in the School of Physics and a Principal Investigator in CRANN at Trinity College Dublin. He received both his BA in Physics and his PhD from Trinity College Dublin. The theme of his research is the production and processing of nano-materials in liquids. The main focus is liquid exfoliation of layered crystals such as graphite and inorganic layered compounds. This produces liquid suspensions of 2-dimensional materials such as graphene, BN, MoS2 or MoO3. Such liquid processing allows the production of coatings, thin films and composites. These structures are useful in a range of applications in areas such as: reinforced composites, transparent conductors, sensors, optoelectronic devices and electrodes for batteries, solar cells, supercapacitors etc. He has also performed research on other nano-materials such as carbon nanotubes and metallic nanowires. He was named the 2011 Science Foundation Ireland 'Researcher of the Year' and was awarded the Kroll Medal from the Institute of Materials in 2012.In 2011, he was named among the top 100 Materials Scientists of the previous decade by Thompson Reuters."

He was said to have masterminded the acquisition of Whiteleys and is continuing in partnership with Meyer Bergman on the development of a number of buildings within the Queensway Estate. Sandelson's previous projects include the Carlyon Bay redevelopment project in St Austell, Cornwall; the acquisition and redevelopment of Somerset Place in Bath where, over 5 years, he oversaw the restoration and redevelopment of a Georgian crescent of houses and apartments, all Grade 1 listed properties; and the HBOS-backed hotel investment brand GuestInvest which was a high profile casualty of the downturn in the UK commercial property market in 2007. In 2015, also in partnership with Meyer Bergman and advised by Savills, Sandelson completed the £250m Project Soya portfolio of sites in Tolworth, Woolwich and Kensington which was recognised as Deal of the Year in the 2016 RESI awards. Recently, Sandelson achieved planning consent for the strategically located Jericho Wharf site on Oxford Canal. He is also cited as having been involved with the acquisition of Thomas Goode & Co., the Mayfair store which was recently sold by Lord Verjee. In May 2016, Sandelson launched a high-end care home business, with its first development purchased in Chelsea, London."

Beginning in 1878, he served as a full professor of anatomy at the University of Basel. In 1888 he was chosen as university rector. Known for his work in the fields of descriptive anatomy and histology, he eventually became associated with studies involving evolutionary theory, developmental history and anthropology. As an anthropologist, he conducted analyses of prehistoric skulls found at Auvernier and Schweizersbild. In 1884 Kollmann introduced the term \"neoteny\" to define the transformation process where animals such as newts mature sexually while still in the larval form."

Blackett was born in Newcastle on 1 January 1728/9, a younger son of John Blackett (1683-1750) and Patience Wise, the daughter of Henry Wise, and a grandson of Sir Edward Blackett, 2nd Bt. He was named after a close friend of his father, Erasmus Lewis, secretary to Lord Oxford. After serving an apprenticeship in Liverpool he became a partner in a Newcastle coal dealership and was for some years steward of the lead mines of his 2nd cousin Sir Walter Blackett. He was one of the original partners of the Newcastle upon Tyne Fire Office, now part of Aviva plc. He was prominent in Newcastle public life, becoming an Alderman and serving as Mayor four times (in 1765, 1772, 1780 and 1790). John Erasmus Blackett died in Newcastle on 11 June 1814 and is buried in St. Nicholas's Church. In 1761 he had married Sarah Roddam and in 1791 their daughter Sarah married Cuthbert Collingwood, a Royal Navy officer who in 1805, as Vice Admiral Collingwood, was second-in-command to Lord Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar. More than ten years after his death Blackett Street, named after him, was constructed as part of the redevelopment of Grainger Town, in the centre of Newcastle."

  "text" : "Josef Schiller (16 June 1877, Ringelsheim (Bohemia) – 1960) was an Austrian phycologist and hydrobiologist. He studied natural sciences at the University of Vienna, earning his doctorate in 1905. Afterwards he was an assistant at the zoological station in Trieste (1905-1910), where he developed an expertise involving benthic algae and phytoplankton. From 1918 he worked as a lecturer of botanical hydrobiology at the University of Vienna, and in 1927 he became an associate professor on the aforementioned subject. He was a visiting scientist at marine stations in Helgoland, Ragusa, Spolato and Rovigno d'Istria, giving classes in botanical hydrobiology. Later in his career, he conducted research in the field of apiology, being known for his studies on the physiological differences between summer and winter bees. From 1938 to 1947, he was in charge of the investigative body for infectious bee diseases at Vienna's University of Veterinary Medicine. The genera Schilleriella, Schillerochloris and Schilleriomonas are named after him, as is the algae species Entodictyon schilleri, named in Schiller's honor by Victor Félix Schiffner (1862-1944)."

In 1797 he obtained his medical doctorate, then practiced medicine in Rheda and later in Dortmund. Afterwards, he moved to Kleve, where he was appointed to the Prussian medicinal council. He later worked in the same capacity in Düsseldorf. Throughout his lifetime, he maintained an interest in the field of pharmacy, and was the author of Pharmaceutische Receptirkunst oder Anleitung für Apotheker (Pharmaceutical formulary or instructions for apothecaries; 1804). He was also the author of textbooks and manuals on obstetrics and surgery that were popular in their time. With Georg Wilhelm Christoph Consbruch (1764-1837), he published Allgemeine Encyclopädie für practische Ärzte und Wundärzte (General encyclopedia for physicians and surgeons; 1803).

Jefferson Stow came to South Australia with his parents and brothers ( Randolph Isham Stow and Augustine Stow) in 1837. After engaging in farming pursuits, he went to the Victorian diggings in 1856, and to the Northern Territory in 1864. In the following year he formed one of a party of seven who sailed from Adam Bay in the Northern Territory to Champion Bay in Western Australia in a small ship's boat named the Forlorn Hope. An account of this expedition was published by Stow, who in 1876 was appointed editor of The South Australian Advertiser in succession to Mr. Harcus. Stow was the author of \"South Australia: its History, Productions and Natural Resources,\" compiled at the request of the South Australian government for circulation at the Calcutta International Exhibition (1883), and published that year. It is a well written and concise manual, and has had an extensive circulation in Australia, England and India. Stow was appointed a magistrate in 1884, and in 1886 Commissioner of Insolvency, and Special and Stipendiary Magistrate at Mount Gambier, South Australia and later at Port Pirie. Stow retired in 1904; he died on 4 May 1908 at North Adelaide, survived by his wife, two sons and five daughters."

  "text" : "James Ford Strachan (1810 – 14 April 1875) was a merchant, grazier and politician in colonial Victoria (Australia), member of the Victorian Legislative Council. Strachan was born in Montrose, Scotland, the fifth son of John Strachan and his wife Isobel, née Smith. Strachan arrived in Van Diemen's Land in 1832 with his widowed mother and two sisters. He was an early settler in Port Phillip District (which later became Victoria), and a leading merchant in Melbourne, in which city he built the first brick store. Strachan was an active promoter of separation from New South Wales, and when the colony of Victoria was constituted in 1851 he was returned to the semi-elective Legislative Council, then the only chamber, as member for Geelong in October of that year. After responsible government was conceded in 1855, Strachan was elected to the first wholly elective Legislative Council for the South-Western Province in November 1856. He was a member of the second Haines Ministry without portfolio from April 1857 to March 1858. During the great constitutional battle between the two Houses on the tariff and Darling grant \"tacks\" Strachan took a leading part on the side of the Council, and resigning his seat for the South-Western Province, contested the Western Province against Henry Miller, who had accepted office under Sir James McCulloch, and defeated him on 10 August 1866. Strachan held the seat until September 1874. Strachan died at Geelong, Victoria on 14 April 1875, aged sixty-five years. He was married to Lilias Cross née Murray, daughter of Hugh Murray, a fellow Scottish emigrant, merchant and grazier."

  "text" : "John R. W. Cracken is an American trial lawyer and private investor based in Dallas, Texas. He is the managing partner of The Cracken Law Firm PC. In 2010, Cracken and his co-counsel filed 69,608 individual actions in Texas state court on behalf of 69,608 consumers against the consumer reporting agency, Trans Union. This was reported by some as the largest mass filing, by a single law firm, in American history. DLA Piper represented Trans Union in the mass filing and in 2011 the matter settled for approximately $27 million. In 2009, Cracken and his co-counsel filed three mass actions in New Mexico state court on behalf of 123 customers against certain directors, officers, and employees of then-bankrupt Eclipse Aviation Corp. The employees were represented by a variety of law firms, including Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. The matter was settled in 2012 for approximately $41 million. Cracken normally litigates class actions and mass actions. Aside from the practice of law, Cracken and long-time private-investment partners John D. Harkey, Jr. and E. Gene Street, were heavily involved in the restaurant industry between 1997 and 2007. They acquired El Chico Restaurants, Inc. (formerly NASDAQ:ELCH), Spaghetti Warehouse, Inc. (formerly NYSE:SWH), along with a variety of private restaurant companies. The resulting company, Consolidated Restaurant Operations, Inc., owned and operated more than 100 full-service, casual-dining restaurants in America and abroad. In 2007 they employed more than 5,000 full and part-time employees. Harkey bought the majority of Cracken's and Street's shares in 2007. Between 1999 and 2001, Cracken and co-founders Harkey and Christopher Hipp co-founded RocketLogix, Inc. (which later became RLX Technologies, Inc.). Hipp invented what is now known as the “blade server”, which consolidated the components of a high-efficiency server on a single printed-circuit-board assembly. It enabled data centers to achieve a high density of servers in their Telco racks. Cracken and Hipp, as CEO and CTO respectively, raised approximately $60 million in venture capital for RLX. This included $40 million from noted financier and philanthropist George Soros. In order to bring RLX’s blade server to market they recruited the then-recently retired executive team from the systems division of former Compaq Computer Corporation. In 2005, HP bought RLX and today the blade server is offered by many of the top server makers in the world, including Cisco, Dell, HP, and IBM."

Rope was born somewhere between Old Summit and Black River, Arizona, but says his earliest memories are from his time near Cedar Creek, which is just West of Fort Apache. Rope's father was Nayundiie, a White Mountain Apache clan leader. He was foster brother to Mickey Free. Rope went to San Carlos in mid-1870 while in his early twenties to enlist along with his brother and Yavapais, Tonto Apaches, San Carlos Apaches, and other White Mountain Apaches. He and his brother shared a horse and rode double to reach their destination. Rope stated that he had joined the army \"in order to help the whites against the Chiricahuas because they had killed a lot of people.\" Rope rode as a scout for General George Crook during the Apache wars. During his time as a scout Rope attempted to arrest Casador (Casadora, Nànt'àntco - \"great chief\") a Western Apache, who was chief of the San Carlos Apaches. Casador had turned renegade after shooting and killing a woman and a man. He had dug in at Black Mesa and during the encounter with Rope one of the other Apache scouts was killed after Casador's warriors had opened fire upon them. Rope was with Crook during the capture of Chihuahua in the Sierra Madres and gave an account of the killing of Chihuahua's aunt by other scouts which resulted in the death of a young white captive boy by name of Charley McComas. Rope was extensively interviewed by Grenville Goodwin in later life. Rope was buried in Bylas, Arizona following his death and was given a full United States military honors burial, by the U.S. Army scouts based in Fort Huachuca. He was the first Apache scout to receive this honor."

  "text" : "Joseph Summers Mus.Doc (1839 – 10 October 1917) was an English-born Australian musician and composer. Summers was youngest son of George Summers, of Charlton Mackrell, Somersetshire, and brother of the sculptor Charles Summers. In early life Summers was a chorister in Wells Cathedral. After studying under such eminent musicians as Dr. Henry Gauntlett and Sir William Sterndale Bennett, Summers graduated Mus. Bac. at the University of Oxford in 1863, and after holding the post of organist at Weston-super-Mare and at Notting Hill, London, he emigrated to Melbourne in 1865 and for fourteen years was choirmaster and organist at St. Peter's, Eastern Hill, Melbourne, one of the oldest and leading Anglican churches in Victoria. In 1876 he was appointed Government Inspector of Music for State Schools; acts as Musical Examiner for the Tasmanian Council of Education; also the Education Department of Victoria, and assisted Professor Ives (late of Glasgow) as examiner at the University of Adelaide. In 1890 the degree of Mus. Doc. was conferred on Summers by the Archbishop of Canterbury, as a social mark of recognition of his anthems and other high-class sacred music. Summers moved to Perth, Western Australia in 1897 where he was commissioned two years later by Fr. James Duff to compose the music for a dramatic production of Milton's poetry. Summers went to court to try and obtain payment for the twenty seven pieces he wrote but was unsuccessful, although he did win the public performing rights. Summers died of heart failure in Perth on 10 October 1917, survived by a son and a daughter; his wife had died in April 1901."

  "text" : "John Sutherland (16 February 1816 – 23 June 1889) was a politician in colonial New South Wales. Sutherland was born near Wick, Caithness in Scotland, and emigrated to New South Wales, arriving in 1838. Having been very successful as a builder, he was elected an alderman of Sydney in 1857, and was mayor in 1861. His principal municipal work was in connection with the sewerage of the metropolis. In 1860 he was returned to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Paddington, which included the constituency of Redfern, which, when subdivided and constituted the separate Electoral district of Redfern, he represented down to the date of his death, with the exception of a short interval, during which he sat in the New South Wales Legislative Council. Sutherland was Minister of Public Works on no less than five occasions—viz., in the John Robertson and Charles Cowper Administrations from October 1868 to December 1870, in the Henry Parkes Ministry from May 1872 to February 1875, in that of James Farnell from December 1877 to December 1878, and in the fourth Parkes Government from January 1887 to January 1889. Sutherland married Mary Ogilvie on 2 May 1839. They had two sons, who died young, and a daughter. He died from diabetes on 23 June 1889."

  "text" : "Jacques Lowe (January 24, 1930 – May 12, 2001) was a photographer and publisher best known for his role as U.S. President John F. Kennedy's official photographer during his election campaign and presidency. Lowe was born in Cologne, Germany, on Jan. 24, 1930. He came to New York in 1949 and became an assistant to the photographer Arnold Newman in 1951. Lowe began working as Kennedy's campaign photographer in 1958, and documented the Kennedy administration after his election until 1962 Lowe died at his home in Manhattan on May 12, 2001. Months after his death, approximately 40,000 of Lowe's negatives were destroyed in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In 2013, two exhibitions were held to mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, WESTWOOD GALLERY NYC, in SoHo, New York, blocks away from Mr. Lowe’s loft in Tribeca, and Proud Galleries Chelsea in London. Both exhibitions included vintage and modern prints from the Estate of Jacques Lowe, printed and signed by Lowe prior to his death. WESTWOOD GALLERY NYC also presented Mr. Lowe’s last exhibition during his lifetime, in 1999."

  "text" : "Julian Thomas, LL.D. (also known as \"The Vagabond\"), born John Stanley James, (15 November 1843 – 4 September 1896) was an English-born Australian journalist and author. Born John Stanley James in Walsall, Staffordshire, England, the only son of Joseph Green James (attorney) and his wife Elizabeth, he changed his name to Julian Thomas around 1872 and went to the United States.Thomas took to journalism on the conclusion of the Civil War, and was attached to papers in New York and San Francisco. He was in France during the Franco-German war, and afterwards visited South America, Tahiti, and Hawaii. Thomas went to Australia in 1874, and commenced the series of \"Vagabond\" papers in the Melbourne Argus, which created a remarkable sensation, and were subsequently republished in book form. In 1877 he went to the newly discovered gold fields in Northern Queensland, and in the following year proceeded to New Caledonia as war correspondent during the native revolt. He was for some months with the French troops attached to the expedition of Henri Rivière, afterwards killed in Tonkin; and visited the Isle of Pines, being the only journalist ever allowed to land there. In 1879 he again travelled through Northern and Central Queensland. On his return he went to the Fiji Islands, and spent some months in that group; and in 1880 visited China, Japan, and British Columbia, returning to Australia in 1882. In that and the following year he spent a long time in the South Pacific, visiting New Caledonia, the New Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, and New Guinea, where he commanded the expedition sent out by the Argus proprietary. The \"Vagabond\" was the first to call attention in the press to French and German aggressions in the South Seas. In 1886 he was special correspondent of the Melbourne Argus at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition at South Kensington. In 1887 he revisited New Caledonia and the New Hebrides, on behalf of the Melbourne Age. He revisited England in 1888, and in 1889 went to Tonga and Samoa for the Age, saw the return of the deposed king Malietoa Laupepa at the latter place, and witnessed the troubles in Tonga. He is author of \"Vagabond Papers\" (five series), \"Occident and Orient\", \"Cannibals and Convicts\", and several plays, of which \"No Mercy\" is the best known. The \"Vagabond\" claimed to have travelled more extensively over Australia and New Zealand than any living journalist at the time. In 1891-2 he acted as secretary to the Royal Commission on Charities appointed by the Victorian Government. Thomas continued to write articles infrequently, mostly for the Melbourne Leader, until dying in Fitzroy, Victoria on 4 September 1896."

  "text" : "Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz (San Miguel de Allende, 1713-1770, Mexico City) was an 18th-century Mexican painter, a mestizo according to the system of racial classification. He is most well known for his casta paintings. Born in 1713 in San Miguel de Allende, he was a contemporary of Miguel Cabrera. Both artists were important to Casta painting and are accredited with many iconic elements of Casta painting that influenced the genre for decades after them. Like many artists in Colonial New Spain, he was a member of painting academy that was established in the mid-eighteenth century. This status gave Morlete a place among the Spanish elite in Mexico. It is evident from documents at the time that both the Viceroy Carlos Francisco De Croix and Viceroy Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa commissioned work from him. Morete Ruiz’s paintings are significant to Mexican art history because Morlete Ruiz was one of the first artists to employ what would become standard elements of 18th century Casta painting. In his Casta sets, much could be determined about the status of the subjects based on their clothing, hair, and surroundings. His paintings featured the Spanish men as the dominant figures in the family. He also used body language to express attitudes and emotions that supposedly resulted from racial mixing. Apart from Casta painting, Morlete Ruiz followed the trend of exoticism by painting local flora and fauna, especially fruits to show a Spanish audience the bounty of the New World. Color contrast, sharp detail, and positioning of the figures reflect the influence of Dutch and Flemish genre painting in his work. Some of Morlete Ruiz’s paintings can be seen today at the LA County Museum of Art and the Museo Nacional de Arte of Mexico City."

He was Secretary of Committees for the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880-81, and Secretary to the Victorian Commissioners to the Calcutta and Colonial and Indian Exhibitions, the success of the Victorian Court at the latter owing much to his organising ability. He was a Commissioner for the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition of 1888. He started the Melbourne Evening Standard newspaper on 29 April 1889, and in 1890 founded the Sporting Standard, of which both papers he was general manager. Thomson left the Evening Standard when it merged with The Herald in 1894, and wrote articles about Western Australia for the Melbourne Age. In the region of Murchison (Western Australia), Thomson started the Murchison Times and Day Dawn Gazette; he died in Perth, Western Australia aged 81."

In 1802, he married Tatnall's daughter, Margaret, with whom he had four children between 1804 and 1809. In 1802, Tatnall also bought the Rotheram Mills, and moved into the ca. 1740 brick house built by Joseph Rotheram, a Quaker who had immigrated to the American colonies in 1723. After his father-in-law died in 1813, Price became a co-owner of Tatnall's milling operations, along with brothers-in-law Thomas Lea and Edward Tatnall and Tatnall relative James Canby. Price later became the first president of the Union Bank of Delaware. He also served as a director of three railroads that together built the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore: the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, the Delaware and Maryland Railroad, and the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad. His service is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument. In 1837, he became the second president of the W&S, after James Canby resigned. Price died in 1840."

Millay left professional baseball in 1938 when his father, who managed a bakery in Evansville, Indiana, was severely injured in an oven explosion. Joe Millay graduated from Reitz Memorial High School in Evansville, Indiana in 1933. He graduated with his B.A. in Physical Education from Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1937. Millay served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and was stationed at the Naval Air Station, Trinidad, where, among other duties, he was a bowling instructor. According to a 1945 Ripley's Believe It or Not article, Joe Millay holds the distinction of being the only athlete in history to achieve perfection in three sports in the same year. In 1938, Millay rolled a 300 in bowling, scored an ace in golf, and pitched a no-hit, no-run game for a professional baseball team. In his lifetime, Millay scored two aces in golf, pitched two no-hit games in professional baseball, and rolled 13 perfect games in bowling."

  "text" : "Joseph Hinckley Clark (c. 1835–1889) was a member of the Clark banking family of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; an officer in the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry; and a director of the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad. Born in Philadelphia, Clark was one of four sons of Enoch White Clark (1802-1856), who founded the financial firm E. W. Clark & Co. in Philadelphia in 1837 and by mid-century had become one of the city's 25 millionaires. A member of a socially prominent family, J. Hinckley Clark joined or participated in several organizations of the Philadelphia elite. He graduated from Harvard University in 1856. In 1859, he was elected a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, Clark hastened to fight for the Union side. He joined the Commonwealth Artillery as a private in the spring of 1861, then accepted a commission in the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry, another organization of the elite and one that distinguished itself in battle. (\"The Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry, also known as Rush’s Lancers, was a completely volunteer unit and one of the finest regiments to serve in the Civil War. Tracing their history from George Washington’s personal body guard during the Revolutionary War, many of the men of the Sixth Pennsylvania were the cream of Philadelphia society...,\" wrote historian Eric J. Wittenberg.) Clark was mustered in on October 4, 1861, as Second Lieutenant of Company F. The following April 19, he was promoted to First Lieutenant of Company K, and then on March 16, 1863, to Captain of Company M. He led his unit in combat at the Battle of Gettysburg. Later, he and his men fought at the Battle of Trevilian Station (June 11–12, 1864), where on the first day they helped \"to drive the rebels from the railway cut and a brick kiln, behind which they had entrenched themselves.\" On the second day of the battle, Clark was taken \"seriously ill\", and relinquished command of his unit to Captain (and future famed architect) Frank Furness, whose actions that day were years later recognized with the Medal of Honor. Clark was transferred to Company C on September 18, 1864, and mustered out the following day. On March 13, 1865, he was brevetted a major of the U.S. Volunteers \"for gallant and meritorious services at the battle of Gettysburg\" and lieutenant colonel \"for gallant and meritorious services in the campaign from the Rapidan to the James.\" After the war, Clark had joined the family firm, working alongside his brothers Edward W. Clark, Clarence H. Clark, and Frank Hamilton Clark. In 1869, he was a director of the LS&M. At the urging of Jay Cooke, a former E.W. Clark partner whose own company controlled the railroad, he joined Jay's brother Pitt Cooke; Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad president Isaac Hinckley; writer John Townsend Trowbridge and 31 others on a publicity trip to Duluth, Minnesota, to extol the virtues of the new \"Chicago on Lake Superior\" and the railroad that served it. In 1873, Clark became a partner in E. W. Clark & Co. Clark died in Philadelphia on November 27, 1889."

Besides her journalistic activities, Bey is notable as an outspoken African-American atheist, who has publicly stated that she believes religion to be actively detrimental to African-Americans, suggesting that religion both contributed to the physical enslavement of African Americans, and continues to contribute to their mental enslavement. She objects to the common characterization of the civil rights movement as a religious one, stating that although churches were significantly involved in the movement, \"humans did all the work.\" In 2015 Bey became the first atheist activist to address the Conservative Political Action Conference’s annual meeting."

Hinostroza has been a major target and opponent of the Ecuadorian government, and has also been a recurring topic of President Rafael Correa's weekly TV and radio talks, which usually last several hours. Correa has referred to her dismissively as “blondie.” In 2012, after Hinostroza reported on a suspicious loan by the state bank Cofiec to a businessman allegedly associated with a cousin of Correa, she received death threats and took a leave of absence for safety reasons. Due to this she was offered security surveillance by the Minister of the Interior José Serrano to which Hinostroza gratefully did not accept. In 2013, she was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists."

  "text" : "Joe Vila (September 16, 1866 – April 27, 1934) was an American sportswriter and editor. He was born Joseph Spencer Vila in Boston, Massachusetts. Vila has been regarded as one of the most influential sportswriters during the first third of the 20th century, while setting fundamental changes in sports coverage during the decades to come. Vila attended Boston Latin School, where he learned to play baseball and football, and entered Harvard College from 1886 to 1887 and the Harvard Law School for a brief time. During his stay at Harvard, he instantly became a member of the football team, and in the following spring joined the baseball team. His individual statistics in both sports assured him a regular position on the varsity teams the following year, but he left college to go into business. After leaving Harvard, Vila went to work on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as a brakeman and baggage smasher. He started his journalism career in his native Boston through a series of newspapers before joining the most sports-oriented daily paper in town, the Boston Herald. In 1889 Vila moved to New York City, where he collaborated for the New York Morning Sun. With writing, in its early years, he introduced a more contemporary play-by-play review for the 1889 Harvard-Princeton match. Four years later, Vila was hired by the New York Evening Sun, one of the city’s most prestigious daily newspapers. In addition, he began to covering boxing in 1898. That allowed him to become the first sportswriter to use a typewriter at ringside, while dictating to a typist round by round the fight between James J. Corbett and Tom Sharkey and sending the resulting copy to a Western Union operator. As a result, other reporters who customarily wrote in longhand rapidly began to switch to typewriters. From 1900 through 1910, Vila covered mostly horse racing and baseball, but later devoted strictly to baseball. By then he was considered a powerful influence behind the scenes in professional sports. In 1902, Vila was instrumental in the Andrew Freedman's decision to sell the New York Giants National League club to John T. Brush. Besides this, he helped to establish a New York baseball team in the newborn American League, when he introduced Jacob Ruppert, by then owner of the New York Yankees, to Joe McCarthy, who would become the Yankees all-time leader managerial wins with 1,460 from 1931 to 1946, including seven World Series titles spanning 1932–1943. Vila became sports editor of The Sun in 1914. In addition to baseball, boxing, football and horse racing, he also covered yachting and rowing. Being sports editor also made him a columnist, while his daily column, entitled Setting the Pace, was to appear six days a week for over 20 years. His column was, unlike those of many of his contemporaries, very factual and straightforward, being often historic and less opinionated. Vila collapsed at his desk in 1934, while covering the opening of the horse race spring meeting at Jamaica Race Course. He was taken to a hospital and then to his home in Brooklyn, where he died later of a heart failure at the age of 67. Following his death, his legacy most definitely continued, inspiring both those already well integrated in The Sun and those young journalists seriously interested in covering the sport on a regular basis. Joe Vila was one of 12 writers who were honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame on a Roll of Honor in its Class of 1946."

He was decorated with the War Cross for Military Valor. He parachuted onto the roof of the World Trade Center in New York in 1981; and launched himself from a tower of the Verrazano Bridge in 1982. In 1986, using a portable ramp, he jumped from the Foresthill Bridge in California on a motorcycle then deployed his parachute, leaving the motorcycle to smash to pieces in the canyon below. He jumped from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in Italy, and from George Washington Bridge in New York, in 1987. He experimented with bat wings in many of his parachute launches. On August 16, 1990, he broke his back after his parachute failed during a jump from an office building in Oakland; he was charged with trespass but the charge was dropped due to his injuries. Carta was killed on September 29, 1990, when the Lockheed PV-2 Harpoon in which he was a passenger crashed during an impromptu aerobatics display."

  "text" : "John Hewlett Nunneley MBE (22 November 1922 - 27 July 2013) was a British army officer and businessman. A veteran of the Burma campaign, he later worked for reconciliation between Japanese and British. He was born in Sydney, Australia and educated at Lawrence Sheriff School in Rugby. He concealed his age to enlist in the Royal East Kent Regiment (the Buffs) at 17 and was commissioned into the Somerset Light Infantry in September 1941. He was seconded to the King's African Rifles (KAR) and mostly served with a battalion recruited from the Tanganyika Territory. He was initially based in British Somaliland where his battalion guarded Italian prisoners after the East African Campaign. He moved to Ceylon in August 1943 while attached to 25 (East African) Brigade headquarters at Kurunegala. He rejoined 36 KAR when it was posted to Ceylon and accompanied it to India and Burma. In 1944 the battalion spearheaded the advance of the Fourteenth Army down the Kabaw Valley. While in Burma he recovered a Union Jack flag that had been captured by the Japanese at Singapore in February 1942. Serving as an Intelligence Officer, he was wounded in the leg by a grenade on 17 October 1944. After the war, Nunneley worked for Beaverbrook Newspapers and as a director of the British Railways Board from 1962 to 1987. As chief publicity officer he worked as Dr Beeching's assistant on writing \"The Reshaping of British Railways\" report (1963). In later life he was chairman of the Burma Campaign Fellowship Group and worked towards reconciliation between Burma veterans of Japan and the Allies. He wrote an account of his wartime experiences and of the death of a young Luo recruit Tomasi Kitinya (Thomas Liech) in Tales from the King’s African Rifles (2000). He had earlier edited Tales from the Burma Campaign 1942-45 (1998) from accounts of Japanese soldiers. In 2001 he was appointed MBE for services to UK-Japanese relations."

  "text" : "John Jeremiah Jacob (October 20, 1778 – 1852) was an American businessman, financier, real estate developer, and philanthropist active in Kentucky. He was involved in banking, as well as in commerce, real estate and infrastructure: railroads, canal, bridge, and utilities. John J. Jacob was born in Baltimore, Maryland,. As a young man he met Thomas Prather in Philadelphia, and became inspired by his talk of the frontier. He left with him for Kentucky in 1800 at the age of 22. With his new-found partner, he established Prather and Jacob. A successful businessman, he became the largest landowner and the richest resident of the city, its first millionaire. Jacob organized and was the first president of the Louisville branch of the Bank of the United States and its successor, the Bank of Kentucky. He organized and was a member of the board of directors for the Galt House. He was president of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad and a member of the board of directors of the Louisville and Frankfort Railroad. He was also treasurer of the Louisville and Portland Canal and involved in the Ohio Bridge Commission in 1827. He was among the founders of the Louisville Gas and Water Company in 1838. Jacob's residence was built on the block bounded by Third and Fourth streets, and Chestnut and Walnut Streets. (He shared the lot with George Keats, brother of the poet John.) His land holdings included much of the eventual central business district and Jacob's Woods, the area presently bounded by Fifth, Preston, Broadway, and Breckinridge streets. (He never owned the area of Jacobs or Jacob's Park, now \"Iroquois Park\"; these were named in honor of his son Charles T. Jacob, who was mayor of Louisville for several terms and initiated the park's purchase and development.) Together with George Keats, in 1841 Jacob was elected to Louisville's City Council for the Fourth Ward. He was a major contributor to Louisville's Blind Asylum and the City Hospital. In 1842, he erected Lyndon Hall, now part of the Hurstbourne Country Club's clubhouse, on his estate in what is now Hurstbourne. His papers are held by the Filson Historical Society's Special Collections in Louisville."

  "text" : "Jean-Sébastien Gerard, born 1970, is a musician also known as Jess from Overlanders, who composed chiptunes for the Atari ST demoscene in the 90s. Some of his chiptunes have been broadcast on Internet web radios, like scenemusic or CVGM. He has contributed, along with many other chiptune composers, to the releases of famous Atari ST \"MegaDemos\". In the demo called \"The Froggies Over the Fence\" demo (released in 1993), all his chiptunes composed on the Atari ST computer can be listened in a special demo screen. The scores of these chiptunes were written in Motorola 68000 Assembler language, not with the help of a graphical music editor. The program routines used to play the Yamaha YM2149 (soundchip in the Atari 1040STF) were all coded and optimized in Motorola 68000 Assembler language by Benjamin Gerard, born 1973, his brother. Jean-Sébastien Gerard also composed soundtracks on Amiga 500, and afterwards on PC platforms. He also released \"Arkanodeep\" EP on Pro-Zak Trax French Electro Label in 2001, under the pseudo of Jess Lysen. His entire music collection can be listened and downloaded freely on his personal web site Jess Music Vault."

  "text" : "Jan Tyssowski (March 8, 1811 – April 5, 1857) born in Tarnów, Poland. was a Dictator of the Republic of Kraków during the failed 1846 uprising. He was a Polish intellectual and activist during Poland's rebellions against its occupying powers. He studied philosophy and law at the University of Lwow. After the failed 1831 November Uprising, Russian authorities prohibited his return to Lwow, and he went study at the University of Vienna. He was a Polish political organizer in Galicia with Ludwik Mieroslawski, and was active within the aristocracy and insurrectionist movement. In 1846, Krakow revolted against the Austrians and they withdrew, leaving the Polish-controlled Republic of Krakow in Tyssowski's hands. The government had originally been established as a triumvirate between Tyssowski and two others, but personal differences led Tyssowski to take control. Intending a \"classless society\", he declared universal suffrage, emancipation of the peasantry, and the discontinuation of rents for peasants. The Republic attempted to expand into neighboring rural areas, and sympathetic peasants did join the cause, but these units were defeated by much larger Austrian armies, which also had broad support among the peasants. On March 3, Russia occupied the city and passed it back to Austria. Roughly 1,200 people were arrested and approximately 100 were imprisoned in the Kufstein Fortress. The Austrian Empire captured Tyssowski who surrendered to the occupying forces, and allowed him to emigrate. He was exiled from Austria and emigrated to the United States in 1847 where he became a Polonia activist in New York City. He published a newspaper and became part-owner of the Deutsche Schnellpost, a German language daily with socialist leanings. He attempted to gain support from the German American community in joining the cause for Polish liberation. He worked for the United States government as a Second Class Clerk and later Assistant Examiner for the US Patent Office."

During the abortive Castilian campaign led by his half-brother the Earl of Cambridge in 1381, John led a contingent of English soldiers. After his troops went unpaid, John led them in a mutiny; he may have been only a figurehead for the mutineers, though, as he (unlike the other conspirators) went unpunished afterwards."

  "text" : "J. Marshall Brown (1924 - deceased prior to 2013) was an insurance agent from New Orleans, Louisiana, who served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from District 12 in his native Orleans Parish from 1952 to 1960. In 1959, Brown announced that he would run for governor of Louisiana, but he soon withdrew from the race ultimately won by former Governor Jimmie Davis. From 1964 to 1972, Brown was the Louisiana Democratic National Committeeman. He was an active supporter of the Kennedy-Johnson, Johnson-Humphrey, and Humphrey-Muskie tickets in 1960, 1964, and 1968, the first of those having been the only one to win Louisiana's then ten electoral votes. At the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Brown led the state delegation in opposition to the seating of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, rather than the Mississippi state party regulars. However, there was no walkout considered by the Louisiana delegation in support of the Mississippians when two MFDP delegates were seated as at-large members. A walkout over the civil rights plank had occurred at the 1948 party convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which led to the third party bid by Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who challenged U.S. President Harry S. Truman and the Republican Thomas E. Dewey. During the 1960s, Brown served on the Louisiana State Board of Education, an elected position, as the representative of Louisiana's 2nd congressional district. On June 6, 1977, Brown was convicted after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, of having knowingly caused a fraudulently-obtained check to be transported in interstate commerce. Brown's insurance business partner, James A. Heinritz, was also implicated in the case. Brown's appeal was rejected in March 1981 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans. Brown had claimed violation of his Fifth and Sixth amendment rights. Brown was released from the United States Bureau of Prisons on April 5, 1989; the website does not indicated how long or where he served in prison. Brown was divorced from the former Marie Blanche Crosby (1923-2013), who was born in Glendale, California. The couple had a daughter, Cindy Brown, of Metairie. Marie Brown was the daughter of Winnie Bouanchaud and Raymond H. Crosby. Her maternal grandfather, Larmartine Bouanchaud, was the long-time sheriff of Pointe Coupee Parish; her maternal great-uncle was Hewitt Bouanchaud of New Roads, the lieutenant governor from 1920 to 1924 under John M. Parker. Her grandmother was the former Olivia Samson. Mrs. Brown was a graduate of Northwestern State University in Natchitoches and received her master's degree in education from Nicholls State University in Thibodaux. She was the former assistant director of the New Roads Memorial Area Vocational School. In 2014, Brown was posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield."

In the following year he was appointed member of the first council of the new university and in 1898 became its second vice-chancellor. He was elected to the council of the Royal Society of Tasmania in 1888. He was a trustee of the Tasmanian Public Library.

He distinguished himself in the campaigns of Manuel I Komnenos against the Serbians, Hungarians, and Pechengs in the years between 1150 and 1153. It was during these campaigns that he was severely wounded and lost the fingers of one hand. In 1155 he was sent to Belgrade where he foiled the plot of the inhabitants of that city to hand the city over to the Hungarians. He was killed in the Battle of Myriokephalon, where he served as a commander of a division of the Byzantine army. He fell, having been isolated from his own troops, fighting alone against a band of Seljuk Turk soldiers of the Sultanate of Rum. John is known to have been present at the ecclesiastical councils convened at Constantinople in 1157, 1166 and 1170. In the acts of those councils he is described as holding the rank of pansebastos sebastos. John Kantakouzenos was married to Maria Komnene, daughter of Manuel I's brother Andronikos Komnenos. They had at least one son, Manuel Kantakouzenos, who campaigned against the Turks with Andronikos Angelos, but afterwards offended Emperor Manuel I, who put him in prison where he was blinded."

The titles have a special remainder to heirs male whatsoever bearing the Name and Arms of Dalzell, which means that they can pass to the senior heir outside of the line descending from the first holder the title, should that line become extinct. The heir is merely required to have the surname and Arms of Dalzell. There is not the requirement that the heir be of the body of the original holder. On Lord Carnwath's death on 7 June 1702, the line of the first Earl became extinct. The titles were therefore able to pass by virtue of the special remainder through collateral succession to Lord Carnwath's second cousin once removed, Sir Robert Dalzell, 3rd Baronet, the senior heir of the first Lord Dalzell.

  "text" : "John White was named Louisiana State Superintendent of Education in January 2012. That year he launched Louisiana Believes, the state’s plan to ensure every child is on track to college or a professional career. In the time since, White has worked to unify the state’s fragmented early childhood system, to modernize expectations for students, to professionalize the preparation of educators, to provide pathways to prosperity for all high school graduates, and to provide families with expansive school options irrespective of their financial means. In 2015, Louisiana 4th grade students made greater gains on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in reading than those made by any other state. In mathematics, Louisiana 4th graders made the second-highest gains among states. Since 2012, Louisiana’s high school graduation rate has risen by 5.2 percentage points. More than 6,300 more graduates from the class of 2016 achieved a college-going ACT (test) score than in the class of 2012, and over the last three years, Louisiana is the most improved state on the ACT among states now using the ACT as their high school test. Louisiana now ranks third in the South among such states for composite ACT average scores. In 2015, Louisiana was also the nation's second fastest-improving state on Advanced Placement (AP) tests. The number of Louisiana students earning AP scores qualifying students for college credit has increased by 116 percent since 2012. And the number of Louisiana graduates annually entering college has grown by more than 2,400 over that period, a 12 percent increase. Prior to being named State Superintendent, White served as Superintendent of the Louisiana Recovery School District, overseeing the nation’s first system of publicly-funded charter and non-public schools in New Orleans and launching the Baton Rouge Achievement Zone. Prior to moving to Louisiana, White worked in New York City under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel Klein. While in New York he served as Deputy Chancellor, launching the Innovation Zone, a network of 100 21st Century schools that use technology to personalize student learning, and leading the city's efforts to turn around more than 100 failing schools and start 500 new charter and district schools. White previously served as Executive Director of Teach For America – Chicago and Teach For America – New Jersey. He began his career as an English teacher at William L. Dickinson High School in Jersey City, New Jersey. White received a B.A. in English with distinction from the University of Virginia and a Master's in Public Administration from New York University. He serves as chairman of the independent non-profit advocacy organization Chiefs for Change and is an Academic Visitor to the John. F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University."

The former West Coast editor of Wine Spectator magazine (where he worked from 1992 – 1999), Morgan began his wine career in his mid-30’s after working as a professional saxophonist in Europe (eventually as bandleader at the Grand Casino in Monte Carlo) and in New York. In 2003 he co-founded Covenant Winery—dedicated to making \"highly regarded\"  kosher Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon among other wine varietals. In 2000, Morgan was hired by specialty food purveyor Dean & DeLuca as Wine Director. During this time, he wrote his first cookbook—Dean & DeLuca, The Food and Wine Cookbook (Chronicle Books 2002). He has written an additional 7 cookbooks since, collaborating with his wife, Jodie Morgan, on winery and restaurant cookbooks for Domaine Chandon, PlumpJack, Ruby Tuesday and Coopers Hawk. Other books include The Working Parents Cookbook, and Rosé, A Guide to the World’s Most Versatile Wine (both with Chronicle Books). Most recently, Morgan and his wife published \"The Covenant Kitchen: Food and Wine for the New Jewish Table\" (Schocken Books, 2015). In 2003, Leslie Rudd, owner of vineyard land in Napa and the proprietor of Dean & DeLuca became Morgan's business partner in Covenant Wines. In addition to his roles as winemaker and cookbook author, Morgan was a founding instructor (since 2003) at the Rudd Center for Professional Wine Studies at the Culinary Institute of America, Napa Valley. Morgan's wines have received praise from Robert M. Parker, Jr. who dubbed the 2005 Covenant Cabernet one of the “finest kosher wines on Planet Earth.”* And in March 2013, the wine critic Jancis Robinson said that Morgan has made, \"The best kosher wine I have ever tasted.\"*"

She broke numerous world records in the process, and at the 1950 World Championships became the first woman to attain a higher score than the winner of the men's championship Hans Deutgen. Lee caused controversy as an early user of artificial points of aim (the 1950 World Championships were the first where the use of them was allowed). She was forced to retire from the sport in 1952 due to injury, and was inducted into the Archery Hall of Fame in 1975."

  "text" : "John Davis Pierce (February 18, 1797 – April 5, 1882) was a Congregationalist minister, public schools advocate, and Michigan legislator. He was Michigan's first superintendent of public schools, a position new to the United States, where he established Michigan's public school system. His work has been compared to that of Horace Mann's. Before his public service career, he attended Brown University and Princeton Theological Seminary, and became an ordained minister of the Congregational Church. When he moved to Michigan as a missionary, he became involved in Michigan politics and ultimately designed the state's public school system as part of their organization for statehood. After his superintendency, he was elected to the state legislature and served on Michigan's 1850 constitutional convention before retiring to his farm outside Ypsilanti for the last thirty years of his life."

He had himself started writing Urdu poems when he was eight years old and later on became a disciple of Mirza Khan Daagh Dehlvi. Ratan Pandoravi, Sahir Hoshiarpuri and Naresh Kumar Shad were his pupils. He is known for his book - Sharh- e – Diwaan – Ghalib, which is a scholarly commentary on Ghalib’s Urdu poetry.

After the Academy closed, Williams went to study at the Noyes Academy in New Canaan, New Hampshire, which in 1835 met the same fate as the Canterbury Female Boarding School. She completed her education at the Oneida Institute in New York. She was an outspoken advocate of abolition and African-American rights. Williams was a member of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS) during the 1830s. She was one of four delegates from the BFASS who attended the Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women in New York in 1837. Williams married Henry Highland Garnett, a teacher, minister, and prominent leader of the abolitionist movement. In 1852, Julia and Henry traveled to Jamaica as missionaries, where Julia headed a Female Industrial School. After the Civil War, Julia worked with freedmen in Washington, DC. She died on January 7, 1870 (aged 58). In 2014 the Prudence Crandall Museum was preparing an exhibit interpreting the life of Williams."

Birchensha invented a system that he claimed would enable non-musicians to learn to compose in a short time by means of \"a few easy, certain, and perfect Rules\". This was at a time when other music theorists were codifying the rules of counterpoint, and writing about other rule-based and combinatorial systems to aid in the composition of music, such as the Arca Musarithmica of Athanasius Kircher.

  "text" : "Jonas Zeuner (Kassel 1727–1814), was an artist and engraver. Zeuner arrived in Amsterdam around 1750 although his first recorded work dates from after 1770. He perfected techniques for engraving in gold and silver leaf, known as verre églomisé. His jewel-like pictures were greatly admired in fashionable Dutch circles. Zeuner's oeuvre consists mainly of town views, largely of Amsterdam, Haarlem, Utrecht and Groningen. However, he also specialised in views of canal and harbour scenes as well as country houses, such as those on the Vecht and the Amstel near Amsterdam. Jonas Zeuner was not the most prolific of painters. He is known to have created about 170 paintings during his lifetime. Zeuner used the distinctive technique of combining oil paint and engraved gold and silver leaf on glass. The result was often breathtaking. Wonderful examples of Zeuner's work are now on permanent display at museums, including the collections of Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam and the Corning Museum of Glass, Corning, New York. There are some paintings by Zeuner showing scenes of England. Zeuner is believed to have lived in England between 1802 and 1806, during which time he produced several works depicting the English countryside and cities."

Howard graduated Framingham Normal School in 1866. In 1883, Howard and twenty-two other American teachers went to Argentina at the request of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Argentina's seventh constitutional president. The teachers were concentrated in Escuela Normal de Paraná, Entre Ríos to study Spanish, and then divided into small groups and were deployed to different parts of the country. Many of the teachers were given only four months of language training. Howard was 38 and already an experienced teacher when she arrived in Argentina. After four months in Parana, Howard and Edith Howe, another Framingham School graduate, assisted in the organization of the Girls' Normal School of Corrientes, where they stayed for two years. After her time abroad, Howard became regent and vice-directress of the Girls' Normal School in Cordoba. She remained there for two years and was subsequently transferred to the Mixed Normal School of San Nicholas, where she remained for sixteen years. In Women in Argentina: Early Travels, Monica Szurmuk wrote that Howard viewed Argentina as backward and barbaric. Howard wrote a book about her experiences as an educator in Argentina titled In Distant Climes and Other Years. Howard wrote that \"it is more difficult for the Latin race to speak the truth\" and the Argentine teachers had \"deeply grounded faults to be eradicated in the young teacher's training which will still take some generations to eradicate.\" Jennie Howard retired in 1903 and remained in her adopted country until her death in 1933."

  "text" : "Jeanne Vertefeuille (23 December 1932 – 29 December 2012) was a CIA officer who participated on a small team that investigated and uncovered the actions of Aldrich Ames, a notorious Cold War spy. Born in New Haven, Connecticut on December 23, 1932, she earned a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Connecticut in 1954, where she also learned German and French. She began her career as a typist for the Agency in 1954 and obtained promotions and expertise on the Soviet Union over several decades, serving in Ethiopia, Finland, and the Netherlands. She was made the lead investigator of a small team looking at the high rate of Russian double agent disappearances in 1986. As it became more clear to the team that there could be a mole in the organization, Vertefeuille worked to keep the team small and focused to minimize the chances of the mole escaping before an arrest could be made. Over the course of 8 years, this investigation led her to Ames's involvement in the disappearances - he had exposed them in exchange for millions of dollars, leading to at least 8 executions. The investigation was fraught with difficulty, but the team began to uncover his treachery in 1989 when it was found that he had bought luxury cars and a house, beyond the salary of a typical CIA agent. The case was not cracked until 1991, when Vertefeuille and her team correlated Ames's meeting times with large deposits in his bank account. She officially retired in 1992 but continued to work as a contractor until a few months before her death in 2012. Ames was arrested with the involvement of the FBI on February 21, 1994. Prior to his arrest, Ames had told the KGB that Vertefeuille had the requisite access to be framed instead. Throughout her career, Vertefeuille was known for her intense personal privacy and solitary nature. She died of brain cancer at the age of 80."

Kaufer received his first job while in his late teens as a writer for the sitcom Mork & Mindy. Filmmaker Howard Zieff later hired Kaufer to do rewrites for his films, and his work on the 1979 film The Main Event led to a development deal enabling him to direct his first film, the romantic comedy Soup for One. At the time, he was the youngest director hired by a major studio. Kaufer did not make another film for seventeen years, however, he had acting roles in two films and wrote and directed an episode of the television series Dream On. In 1997, his second and final film, Bad Manners, was released. The film, based on a play by David Gilman, received positive reviews, holding an 84% approval rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes. Kaufer dated model and actress Myra Jean Hall. After he became angry when he learned that she had been in a relationship with another man, he attacked her and was jailed for attempted murder. He was married to actress Pia Zadora from August 1995 to November 2001, and the two had one son together. In 2010, Kaufer sued Zadora, due to claims that Zadora had made which Kaufer alleged were defamation; however, the case was thrown out. Kaufer died on October 2, 2013 when he was ejected from a vehicle while driving from Las Vegas to Los Angeles."

  "text" : "John Black Atkins (5 November 1871 – 1954) was a British journalist. He served as the war correspondent for the Manchester Guardian in the Spanish–American War, the Greco-Turkish War and in the Second Boer War. He also wrote the biography of William Howard Russell. Atkins was the third son of James Bucknell Esq., of Anerley. He was born on 5 November 1871. He completed his schooling from Marlborough College in 1889, and B.A. in 1892 and M.A. in 1896 from Pembroke College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he was a rival against William Beach Thomas for the Cambridge University athletics team. After completing his education at Cambridge, Atkins joined the Manchester Guardian. He left England on 23 April 1898 as the first special correspondent of the newspaper to cover the Turco-Greek War of 1897. As war correspondent for the Manchester Guardian he covered the Spanish–American War of 1898 in both Cuba and Puerto Rico. Atkins covered the Battle of El Caney and accompanied General William Rufus Shafter's army in the Capture of Santiago in Cuba. In Puerto Rico he covered the attack on Asomante Heights and interviewed General Nelson A. Miles. Atkins was specially chosen by Charles Prestwich Scott, the then editor of the Manchester Guardian to cover the Second Boer War for his journalistic skills. Scott who sought to reflect his newspaper as a neutral force in the opposition of the war chose Atkins for his non-imperialistic views. Yet as the war progressed Atkins tended to support the war effort sticking only to the facts. Atkins made friends with fellow correspondent Winston Churchill (who later went on to be the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom) whom he described as \"slim, slightly reddish-haired, pale, lively, frequently plunging along the deck\". He later published the book The Relief of Ladysmith based on his experience in the Boer War. On his return to England he was promoted to London editor in 1901. He left the Manchester Guardian in 1907 and joined The Spectator as an assistant editor. He held that position until 1926."

At the start of World War Two, he worked in civil defence for a brief period before joning the Royal Navy as a signaller. Morris served on Arctic convoy ships including one that was shelled by the Tirpitz. He sold drawings and a sketchbook depicting his experiences in Archangel and Murmansk to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC. In 1945, whilst still serving in the Navy, WAAC approved a full-time salaried contract for Morris, to record the work in the Far East of the British Pacific Fleet, alongside Leonard Rosoman. He worked in Rangoon after liberation, in Hong Kong, Formosa, Shanghai, Tokyo and Yokohama, making him the only full-time WAAC artist to reach China and Japan. He recorded naval scenes aboard HMS Belfast and HMS Argonaut, cityscapes and war damage including works showing areas of Yokohama that had been extensively bombed. He recorded the interior of the imperial Diet in Tokyo and the post-war celebrations in Shanghai."

  "text" : "James White (19 July 1828 – 13 July 1890) was a politician in colonial New South Wales, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and later, the New South Wales Legislative Council. White was also a racehorse owner and punter. White was born in Stroud, New South Wales, while he was still at school his father died, and James White at the age of sixteen was called upon to manage extensive station properties, and gradually took up more and more outlying country on his own account, until he became one of the largest and most successful New South Wales squatters. He did a fair share of work in pioneering country on the Barwon, Hunter, and Castlereagh Rivers, and was almost uniformly successful in his enterprises. In 1869 White went to England, and remained away several years, during which time he visited all the principal cities of Europe. In 1866 White was elected to the Assembly for the Upper Hunter, and kept that position for three years; he then resigned upon going to Europe. He was nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 3 November 1874, a position he held until his death. As a racing man, White was first known in connection with a steeplechaser called Hotspur, who won the A.J.C. Steeplechase in 1876. His first notable racehorse was Chester, who was trained in conjunction with Roodee by Etienne L. de Mestre, and won the double—Victoria Derby and Melbourne Cup. Another of his horses, Democrat, won the Sydney Cup and Metropolitan in 1878, and in the spring of 1879 Palmyra won Mr. White his first Maribyrnong Plate. In 1880 Sapphire won the Oaks, and The Pontiff the AJC Metropolitan Handicap, and in 1883 Iolanthe won for him the Maribyrnong Plate, and Martini-Henry carried off the double—Derby and Melbourne Cup. Finding that from failing health he could not stand the excitement of a close attention to racing, Mr. White sold all his horses in training and yearlings in April 1890, and they realised phenomenal prices. Titan alone brought 4,000 guineas, the highest price ever given for a yearling in the Colonies, and the total for thirteen lots was 17,498 guineas. Mr. White continued his breeding establishment at Kirkham, New South Wales, with a view to racing in England. He was the most successful racing man ever known in Australia at the time. During the thirteen years he was racing White took a keen interest in everything pertaining to the welfare of the turf, and his colours were always popular with the public, because every one knew that once seen at the post they were there to try and win. His colts Kirkham and Narellan were both entered for the Epsom Derby in 1890, but the latter was scratched, and the former failed to secure a place. White died on 12 July 1890."

In 1453, however, he managed to escape, and taking advantage of a widespread revolt against the Despots, seized the castle of Aetos, claiming his father's title. In 1454, however, faced with the combined forces of Despot Thomas and his Turkish allies under Turahan Bey, he abandoned the fortress and fled to the Venetian stronghold of Modon. From there he went to Italy; he is reported as being in Genoa in 1459, and from 1464 until his death in 1469 he resided in Rome."

From 1762 to 1774, he served at the court of Louis XV as premier valet de la chambre, losing his post on the death of the king. He wrote many operas, mostly comic, and a four-volume collection of songs for solo voice, Choix de chansons mises en musique illustrated by Jean-Michel Moreau. Many of the songs from the collection were later published individually through the efforts of the English folksong collector Lucy Etheldred Broadwood. His Essai sur la musique ancienne et moderne was published in 1780. La Borde was guillotined during the French Revolution in 1794."

McCarron came to prominence as a leading figure in the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses, based in Derry. In the early 1890s, he was the secretary of the local branch, and was imprisoned in the aftermath of a strike. Soon becoming the most prominent member of his union in Ireland, he was elected to the Parliamentary Committee of the Irish Trades Union Congress every year from 1894 until 1909, and served as President on three occasions, in 1899, 1907 and 1910. In the mid-1890s, McCarron, was a proponent of land nationalisation, but he later joined the Labour Representation Committee, then later the new Irish Labour Party. He was elected to Derry City Council, becoming the group's leader, later an alderman, and Chairman of the Public Health Committee. McCarron was an Irish nationalist, but was a staunch defender of the role of British-based trade unions in Ireland. He was appointed as one of two representatives of the labour movement on the Irish Convention of 1917 and early 1918, which unsuccessfully considered the question of Irish home rule. In late 1918, McCarron set sail for Wales aboard the RMS Leinster, with fellow trade unionist Patrick Lynch. On 10 October, the ship was torpedoed and sank, with McCarron and Lynch among the dead. A large memorial in the form of a Celtic cross was erected in his memory in Derry City Cemetery."

In 1874, he joined the Amalgamated Tin Plate Workers of Birmingham, Wolverhampton and District, and was elected as its President in 1880, and then as Secretary in 1886. In this role, he persuaded the various local associations of tinplate workers to unite, forming the National Amalgamated Association of Tin-Plate Workers in 1894. He was elected Secretary of the new union, dominating it until his retirement in 1919. Stevens was elected to Birmingham City Council on its formation in 1889, defeating Austen Chamberlain, retaining his seat as a Liberal-Labour member until 1907. At the 1900 general election, he stood in Birmingham East, but lost heavily, and was again defeated in December 1910. In 1897, the annual Trades Union Congress was held in Birmingham, and Stevens served as its President. He also held various prominent roles on the Birmingham Trades Council, was the first President of the National Committee of Organised Labour for Old Age Pensions, and was prominent in the Ancient Order of Foresters."

Martov (Ма́ртов; real name Yuliy Osipovich Tsederbaum (Russian:  Ю́лий О́сипович Цедерба́ум; IPA: [ˈjʉlʲɪj ˈosʲɪpəvʲɪtɕ tsɨdʲɪrˈbaʊm, ˈmartəf] ) (24 November 1873 – 4 April 1923) was a Russian politician who became the leader of the Mensheviks in early 20th-century Russia. He was the founder and editor of Russia's first Jewish journals and newspapers in Hebrew, Yiddish,and Russian; the Hamelits (the Mediator), the Kol Mevasser (the Harbinger), the Yidisher Folksblat (the Jewish People's Journal), and Vestnik russkikh evreev (the Russian-Jewish Courier). According to his sister and fellow Menshevik, Lydia Dan, Martov had an 'inexhaustible charm that attracted people'. As a result, some commented it was frequently difficult to record why they followed him, and he confessed himself that 'I have the nasty privilege of being liked by people'. He was an old friend and mentor of Trotsky. Trotsky later described him as the 'Hamlet of Democratic Socialism'. Lenin later confessed in 1921 that his single greatest regret was 'that Martov is not with us. What an amazing comrade he is, what a pure man!'"

Lacey was a Greenwich Village based woodcarver known as \"The Prince of Fuss and Feathers\" for his representations of birds that have been displayed at the National Audubon Society.

Employed in the insurance business, he began carving and painting duck decoys as a hobby. Eventually, he gave up his position as an actuary and went into sculpting full-time. In order to sculpt a bird, he worked from photographs as well as specimens he caught (along with his dog, Ned), killed, and taxidermed himself. He then would carved the gross shape from a bandsaw and detail with a pocket knife. He cited the secret of his success as a \"deep feeling\" for birds and his \"careful observation of their fascinating behavior.\" \"I like what nature did to birds, and I don't believe I can improve on it,\" he told reporter Diane Barkley Hutton in 1946. In 1951, he published The Audubon Book of Bird Carving as told to Tom Moore McBride (New York: McGraw-Hill)."

In 1745 he joined the choir of the royal chapel, where he also played the harpsichord. His first operatic piece, Amaryllis, premiered in 1752. Cardonne continued to enjoy the patronage of the royal family, writing harpsichord and vocal music for them. From 1768, he tried to establish a career as an opera composer. His lack of success led to his return to the court, where he became maître de la musique du roi (master of the King's music) in 1780.

  "text" : "Jonas Carl Linnerhielm (30 August 1758 - 12 February 1829) was a Swedish nobleman, State Herald of Sweden, artist and writer. He is arguably most well known for his accounts of his travels within Sweden, which he illustrated himself and published in three volumes between 1797 and 1816. Linnerhielm studied at the University of Lund and graduated in 1776. He pursued a career as a civil servant, holding different offices between 1776 and 1796. During this time he was taught drawing, and came under the influence of Elias Martin and his brother Johan Fredrik Martin. In 1795 his wife, Helena Maria Ehrenstråhle, published a short collection of poems to which Linnerhielm made illustrations. The illustrations are in the style of Salomon Gessner. It has been described as one of the best examples of Swedish book art during the 18th century. In 1794, he inherited his father's manorial estate, Ebbetorp manor, in Småland. Two years later he resigned from his official duties to concentrate his efforts on the running of the estate. In 1799-1800 he renovated the main house and created an English landscape garden on the grounds. Between 1797 and 1809 he published three volumes of travel accounts from Sweden, illustrated by himself (Bref under resor i Sverige (1797), Bref under nya resor i Sverige (1806) and Bref under senare resor i Sverige (1816)). These books are considered to be the first examples of purely recreational travel writing in Swedish. Linnerhielm has been called \"the first Swedish tourist\"."

Woods was the second son of Richard Woods, a Liverpool railwayman, and his wife Mary, née Cave. After being trained as an engineer, he was employed in Canada and England; and landed in Melbourne in 1852, after a chequered experience at the Ovens, M'Ivor, Goulburn, Ararat and Fiery Creek diggings, during which he was a prominent exponent of miners' rights. Woods was returned to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in October 1859 for the Crowlands district, which he represented until August 1864 and again from April 1871 to April 1877. Woods was then elected for Stawell in May 1877, which he represented till his death. Whilst out of Parliament, from 1865 to 1870, Woods entered the Government service, and was in charge of the works at the Malmesbury reservoir, when he was summarily dismissed on an allegation, into which inquiry was refused, that he had connived at some laches on the part of the contractors. Woods took office as Minister of Railways in the first Graham Berry Government in August 1875, and made some sweeping changes in the tariff of charges. He retired with his colleagues in October of the same year, but was appointed to the same post in the second Berry Administration in May 1877, retiring in March 1880. Woods died in Brighton, Melbourne, Victoria on 2 April 1892 and was buried in Boroondara General Cemetery."

  "text" : "Joseph Underwood  (1779 - 30 August 1833) was a prominent Australian merchant in the years following the Rum Rebellion. He arrived in New South Wales in 1807 on the back of sound references from the British Secretary of State and in 1810 presented himself to Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, Governor of New South Wales following the usurping of William Bligh earlier in the year, as an expert merchant. Macquarie commissioned Underwood to visit foreign markets and increase economic imports, starting with Calcutta, India where he imported spirits. By owning the ships privately, but mortgaged to a nominal owner, Underwood could evade taxes imposed by the East India Trading Company. His journeys took him to London, India and South Africa's Cape of Good Hope, where his ship was wrecked in 1812. Moving into seal hunting, despite the decline of the industry, Underwood purchased a 186-ton hunting vessel and partook in whaling and acquiring seal oil. He expanded his fleet, importing pork from Tahiti and cedar and coal from Hunter River, sold seal skin in China, and imported tea from Bengal. On the return journey from Bengal he came across a derelict, the Seringapatam. The United States Navy had captured Seringapatam during the War of 1812, but mutineers and prisoners of war had recaptured her. Underwood acted as the crew's agent in claiming salvage from the Court of Vice-Admiralty at Sydney, but the court referred the matter to London. Macquarie eventually requested Captain Eber Bunker to sail Seringapatam to England, where she was returned to her owner. Underwood's other vessels continued to range across vast trading routes, reaching Batavia and Mauritius by the early 1820s. By 1821 Underwood retired from personally undertaking these voyages. Instead, he purchased land in the City of Newcastle and Ashfield, New South Wales, to retire to. He also bought up various tracts of land and took up dairy farming. He was widowed in 1818, though with several children;his second wife, Elizabeth Underwood, survived him."

There, he was elected leader of the Students' union, and conducted a successful campaign to have Welsh made an official language there, alongside English. Jones was active in Y Tair G, which in 1925 became a component of the new Plaid Cymru. In 1928, he became a teacher in London, and he founded a successful branch of Plaid there; as a result, in 1930, he was appointed General Secretary of the party and returned to Wales. In this role, he was responsible for organising party conferences and rallies, and supporting local branches. Jones only stood for election once - at the 1950 general election in Caernarfon, but was publicly best known for putting together party press releases, and also for his broadcasting on the topic of gardening. He stood down in 1962, becoming an official adviser to the party. While campaigning in the 1970 general election, Jones was killed in a car accident."

In 2013, he began hosting a weekend movie program on the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) in Canada. Gorber is a featured critic for Twitch Film, a regular contributor to Huffington Post/Moviefone, a Rotten Tomatoes accredited critic, and has contributed freelance articles to several print publications including the Toronto Star. Gorber's profile at the Online Film Critics Society describes him as \"a pioneer in online film criticism.\" He has been an accredited reviewer at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) since 1997 and created the site filmfest.ca to document the festival's activities. In early 2013, he wrote a piece in the Toronto Star describing his preferred seating locations at many of Toronto's major cinemas. Gorber writes that finding a proper seat is \"nearly as important as the film itself\" for viewers interested in a full cinematic experience, describing the search as \"part art, part science\" for a committed few. He has also written reviews of specialty cinemas, in 2013 profiling the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas. Gorber has been described by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a \"Star Wars fanatic.\" Following Disney's announcement in late 2012 of plans to create a Star Wars Episode VII (Star Wars: The Force Awakens), he tweeted, \"I will be 43 years old in 2015, and yet I will still be lining up. This is what I do. So, who's with me in line?\""

  "text" : "John MacGregor (1828 – 27 March 1884) was a politician in colonial Victoria (Australia), and Minister of Mines. MacGregor was the son of John Macgregor, and was born in the island of Skye, Scotland. He arrived in Victoria in 1840, was admitted a solicitor of the Supreme Court in 1855, and practised in Melbourne, in what was latterly the firm of MacGregor, Ramsay, & Brahe. MacGregor unsuccessfully contested East Bourke in 1856 and 1861, but after the retirement of Wilson Gray in September 1862 MacGregor was returned for Rodney, for which district he sat in the Victorian Legislative Assembly till March 1874, when he retired from Parliament. MacGregor joined the first James McCulloch Government, and was Minister of Mines from July 1866 to May 1868. On the defeat of the John Alexander MacPherson Ministry in April 1870 MacGregor was asked by the Governor to form a Government, but he recommended that Sir James McCulloch should be sent for. MacGregor brought in, and for the first time carried, a Payment of Members Bill. He had long retired from public life when he died on 27 March 1884 at his home in Gipps street, East Melbourne, Victoria."

Born in Bermondsey, London, he was shipped to Australia as a convicted felon in 1790. He learned his trade in Sydney, becoming joint owner of a merchant ship, Diana in 1799. He founded Kable & Underwood, a merchant trading company, and utilised Diana for seal hunting in the Bass Strait. As his enterprise expanded, Underwood added coal and sandalwood shipping to his business interests, increased the size of his fleet, and added Simeon Lord as a business partner. He continued to build ships, including a 200 tonne King George. He became one of the leading figures of the fledgingly sealing industry in New South Wales, employing over sixty men and bringing 30,000 skins annually. He returned to London to sell over 120,000 skins, and with the proceeds bought out his partner, Lord. On return to New South Wales he founded a coffee lounge, helped found the Commercial Society of Sydney and also joined the Standing Committee of the Emancipated Colonists of New South Wales. He became a leading merchant, and \"one of the few merchants engaged in importing from Europe and India.\" He built a distillery with two more business partners whom he subsequently bought out The proceeds of his expanding businesses funded a homestead said to be among \"the three or four finest in Sydney.\" He returned to England to retire in 1840 and died four years later in Surrey. He was married twice, in 1812 and against in 1825 after the death of his first wife. He had seven children in total, two of whom died in infancy."
