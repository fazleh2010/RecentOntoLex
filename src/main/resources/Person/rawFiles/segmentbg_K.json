  "text" : "Ken Tyler (born June 8, 1951) is a Canadian retired ice hockey coach. Tyler spent much of his career coaching the Austrian men's national team in international competitions, including the 1994 Winter Olympics. Born in Toronto, Ontario, Tyler played college hockey at McMaster University, a season of pro with the Broome Dusters and a season of senior hockey with the Cambridge Hornets. Tyler spent nine seasons coaching at McGill University, finishing with a record of 130 wins, 200 losses and 27 ties. During his time at McGill, Tyler heavily recruited Mike Babcock, who would go on to become the first coach to become a member of the Triple Gold Club. Tyler started his tenure as the head coach of Austria's men's national hockey team at the 1992 IIHF Group B World Championship, which was held in Austria. The team went undefeated and finished first in Group B play, which made them eligible for promotion to the A pool for the following year's tournament. Tyler remained Austria's head coach until after the 1996 IIHF World Championship. At this tournament, Austria finished in 12th place and was relegated to the B Pool for the 1997 tournament. His coaching career with Austria also included their appearance at the 1994 Winter Olympics, where they finished in 12th place."

It was his defection from Later Liang to Later Tang in 923 and subsequent offering of intelligence to Later Tang's emperor Li Cunxu that persuaded Li Cunxu to launch a surprise attack on the Later Liang capital Daliang that resulted in the fall of Later Liang, for which Kang was rewarded and given the imperially-bestowed name of Li Shaochen. He subsequently had major contributions in Later Tang's conquest of Former Shu as well. After Former Shu's fall, however, with Li Cunxu killing the major generals Guo Chongtao and Li Jilin (Zhu Youqian), Li Shaochen became apprehensive and decided to rebel, but was subsequently defeated and executed."

In 1974, as a 17-year-old, he topped the field of the Saint Paul Winter Carnival Tournament—held at Battle Creek Park—with jumps of 196 feet (60 m) and 197 feet (60 m). The 197 feet (60 m) leap tied the hill record. Additionally, he leaped 202 feet (62 m), but a fall kept that effort from remaining in the record book. Sundgaard attended the University of Utah and won the 1976 NCAA ski jumping championship. He also placed second that year at the Canadian Nationals. Sundgaard was on the US team for eight years, competing at the 1976 Winter Olympics and several World Championships. His greatest ever jump came in 1979 on the ski flying hill at Planica, Slovenia, when he went 464 feet (141 m). Jumping for the St. Paul Ski Club, he won the St. Paul Memorial Trophy eight times, given to the winner of their annual competition. Sundgaard was inducted into the American Ski Jumping Hall of Fame in 2008."

  "text" : "General Kim Won-hong (김원홍) (17 July 1945) is a North Korean politician and military leader. Kim was born in North Hwanghae Province on 17 July 1945. He graduated from the Workers' Party of Korea's Kim Il-sung Higher Party School and has been serving in the Korean People's Army since 1962, holding several positions in the army's General Political Bureau as well as commander of army corps. His first public mention was as a funeral committee member for late Marshal Choe Kwang in 1997. He was elected deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly in 1998. Kim Won-hong rose to prominence in 2003, as he was appointed commander of the Military Security Command (the North Korean army's intelligence unit) following the death of General Won Ung-hui, who had been heading it since 1990. In April 2009, Kim was promoted to General and then migrated to the KPA General Political Bureau's Organisation Department, at the same time when Kim Jong-il reportedly put Kim Jong-un in charge of the Ministry of State Security to which the Military Security Command is affiliated. Kim was also made a member of the Party's Central Committee and Central Military Commission in September 2010 and was reported to having a role in ensuring Kim Jong-un's succession. After Kim Jong-il's death and acting head of State Security U Tong-chuk's purge, Kim Won-hong appeared as one of Kim Jong-un's most trusted and supporting generals. He was made a Politburo member as well as the first minister of State Security in 25 years in April 2012. He was also elected member of the National Defence Commission. He sang at an International Women's Day concert attended by Kim Jong-un on March 2012."

  "text" : "Kazimierz Jelski (1782 – March 1867 in Vilnius, Lithuania) was a Polish Classicist architect and sculptor active in Lithuania. Jelski was born in Ejsymonty near Grodno, today in Belarus. He was the son of Karol Jelski who was a Polish sculptor, painter and stucco artist. He first studied under his father. Between 1800 and 1808 he studied painting and architecture at the Vilnius University. For painting he studied under Laurynas Gucevičius and Franciszek Smuglewicz, architecture with Michała Szulca and sculpture with Andrzej Le Brun. From 1809 he studied sculpture at the Imperial Academy of Arts. From 1811 to 1826, Jelski worked as a professor of the University of Vilnius, where he trained many renowned sculptors. In 1833, he unsuccessfully tried to get a job as a professor of sculpture at the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, and in 1843 tried to set up his own school of sculpture in Vilnius. He also had expertise in the valuation and maintenance of sculptures. He collaborated with many famous sculptors. At the end of his life he was forced to arrange English kitchens and build steam mills in the estates. He performed primarily classical sculptures and bas-reliefs and religious monuments and busts and medallions which displayed portraits of famous people of Polish culture and historical figures. Some of his key works include the figures of plaster in the Vilnius Cathedral, statues and bas-reliefs at the Evangelical Reformed Church, four sculptures at St. Peter and St. Paul's Church, and numerous monuments in Vilnius and Trakai. He also authored a book The union of architecture, sculpture and painting (1832). Jelski died March 1867 in Vilnius."

  "text" : "Kalipada Pahan, Professor of Neurological Sciences, Biochemistry and Pharmacology, and the Floyd A. Davis, M.D., Endowed Chair in Neurology in Rush University Medical Center, is an eminent Indian American neuroscientist involved in translational research on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and Batten disease. He is known for his research on statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs. He first explored the application of statins in suppressing the inflammatory events in microglia, astroglia and macrophages. This finding has revolutionized the research on statin drugs. Later his lab has shown that statins may be beneficial in protecting neurons and improving locomotor activities in Parkinson's disease by suppressing the activation of p21/Ras. Recently his lab has delineated a unique crosstalk between fat and memory in which the lipid-lowering transcription factor PPARalpha controls the formation of hippocampal memory via transcriptional regulation of CREB (Roy et al., 2013, Cell Reports 4: 724-737). He has published more than 150 papers in many peer-reviewed journals including Journal of Biological Chemistry, Journal of Immunology, Journal of Neuroscience, Cell Death and Differentiation, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, Journal of Clinical Investigation, Cell Reports, and Cell Metabolism. He is the recipient of \"D. H. Reinhardt Scholar\" award from the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) College of Dentistry and the \"Silver U\" award from the UNMC Chancellor's council. He also received the outstanding teaching award from the UNMC College of Dentistry."

After her death in 1759, he married Dorothy Meschele. He had a son John Christopher with his first wife. Perwanger's sculptural techniques were influenced by the workshop of Antoniego Kornowskiego in Tolkmicko. He pioneered Rococo in Warmia. His works have been executed in plaster, marble, sandstone, wood and ivory. Perwanger's workshop produced figural sculptures and woodcarving works in the pulpit, confessionals and decorations for local churches."

  "text" : "Kermit \"Scotty\" Scott (died February 2, 2002) was a jazz tenor saxophonist. Dizzy Gillespie considered Scott “one of the founders of our music” [bop]. Born in Beaumont, Texas, Scott's first professional work was with Bunk Johnson's band before touring with other jazz bands and minstrel shows, eventually arriving in New York in 1936. In 1940 he played in two different line-ups backing Billie Holiday at recording sessions in New York for Columbia. The first, on February 29, featured Roy Eldridge on trumpet, Carl Frye and Jimmy Powell on alto saxophones, Scott on tenor saxophone, Sonny White on piano, Lawrence Lucie on guitar, John Williams on bass, and Hal West on drums. The second session, on June 7, had Eldridge again, with Bill Bowen and Joe Eldridge on alto saxophones, Scott and Lester Young on tenor saxophones, Teddy Wilson on piano, Freddie Green on guitar, Walter Page on bass, and J.C. Heard on drums. He also played in Coleman Hawkins' orchestra in 1940. That same year, he joined Teddy Hill's band, the first house band at Minton's, with Thelonious Monk, Kenny Clarke and Joe Guy. In April 1944, he was in a band led by Jesse Miller performing at Joe's Deluxe Club, with Albert Atkinson (sax), Ike Day (drums), Argonne Thornton (piano), and Walter Buchanan (bass)."

In 1991 he was identified as one of 34 convicts in custody in Canadian prisons who had been diagnosed with an AIDS infection.In 1991 guards, calling upon the terms of their union's contract, argued that Ratte should be kept in isolation, because his infection posed a risk to their health.Ratte argued that this segregation violated his rights. In 2000 Ratte was convicted of attacking guards, and trying to infect them.According to the CBC News Ratte requested a longer sentence so he would be held in Federal custody—not Provincial custody.According to an article in the Canadian HIV/AIDS Policy and Law Review he requested the longer sentence because he considered himself too dangerous to be held in Provincial custody.Ratte was escorted to court by four guards, wearing body armour, gloves, and protective eye-guards. Each guard was holding a leash attashed to a collar. In 2010 Ratte and two associates were convicted of a home invasion.Ratte agreed to testify against a Tracy L. Caron, a Kingston area woman, who was charged with trying to hire someone to hurt Clifford Richards. Richards was murdered on October 26, 2010, at which time Ratte was already in custody. But he testified she discussed hiring someone to hurt Richards before his apprehension. In June 2013 Ratte attacked Omar Khadr, shortly after Khadr had been transferred to a prison in Edmonton."

  "text" : "Kay Patricia Setches (born 28 November 1944) is an Australian politician. She was an Australian Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1982 to 1992, representing the electorate of Ringwood. She was Minister for Conservation, Forests and Lands from 1988 to 1990, Minister for Community Services from 1990 to 1992 and Minister Responsible for Child Care from 1991 to 1992. Setches was born in Melbourne, and was educated at St Joseph's Collingwood, Cromwell Street State School, and the Collingwood School of Domestic Arts. She resided in Croydon from 1964, and was a shop assistant before entering politics. She joined the Labor Party in 1972 and was involved in a number of community organisations, including serving as co-ordinator of the Maroondah Halfway House Group, a women's refuge, from 1977 to 1978 and president of the Boronia Technical School Council from 1979 to 1983. She was also an advocate for the rights of people with intellectual disabilities. Setches was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1982 state election, defeating two-term Liberal MP Peter McArthur, and was re-elected in 1985 and 1988. She was promoted to the ministry in 1988 as Minister for Conservation, Forests and Lands, shifted to Minister for Community Services in 1990, and added the new portfolio of Minister Responsible for Child Care in 1991. Setches was minister during a period of significant change: she introduced mandatory reporting of child abuse, formally closed the notorious Sunbury Asylum however little was done to accommodate the insane who for the most part were left to roam the streets in places like St Kilda resulting in some being shot by police after turning violent, increased funding to Kew Cottages, and advocated the outlawing of surrogacy. Her seat of Ringwood was abolished for the 1992 election and she contested and lost the new notionally Labor seat of Bayswater as Labor were resoundingly defeated that year. In retirement, she was one of the co-founders of EMILY's List Australia, and was a board member of the Victorian Women's Trust and the Queen Victoria Women’s Centre Trust. She was one of the inaugural additions to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001. She subsequently retired to Victoria Harbour at Docklands, and has spoken about planning issues in the area. Both of her children have been involved in Labor politics; her son, Earl Setches, is the secretary of the Plumbing Trades Employees Union, and her daughter, Vicki Setches, was the unsuccessful Labor candidate for Kilsyth at the 2010 state election. Three of her parliamentary advisers, Alan Griffin, Gavin Jennings and Lynne Kosky, subsequently went on to political careers of their own as federal and state ministers."

At different points in his career, Kellen analyzed postwar German soldiers, defectors from behind the Iron Curtain, captured Viet Cong, and terrorists. He was among the first intelligence analysts to conclude that, contrary to prevailing U.S. administration assessments, enemy morale in the Vietnam War was in fact high and that the war was not winnable; while at the RAND Corporation Kellen co-authored an open letter to the U.S. government urging withdrawal of troops."

  "text" : "Kamal Dasgupta or Kamal Ali (Bengali: কমল দাশগুপ্ত; 28 July 1912 – 20 July 1974) was a twentieth-century Bengali music director, composer and folk artist. Rāga and Thumri were the main elements of his music. His wife Firoza Begum (1930-2014) was a noted Nazrul Sangeet singer. Their second and third sons Hamin Ahmed and Shafin Ahmed are lead singers with Bangladeshi Band Miles. Kamal Dasgupta was born on 28 July 1912 in Narail, Jessore of then British India (now Bangladesh). He matriculated in 1928 from Calcutta Academy and later completed B. Com. from Comilla Victoria college. He earned his Doctorate in Music from Benaras Hindu University in 1943 for his work on Mira Bai, the composer and singer of Bhajans. His early inspiration came from his father, Tara Prasanna Dasgupta. He took his first music lessons from his brother, Bimal Dasgupta. Later he studied under Dilip Kumar Roy, Kana Kesta, and Ustad Jamiruddin Khan. Kamal Dasgupta was a versatile musical genius. He sang modern songs in Bengali, Urdu, Hindi, and Tamil. He was also a brilliant composer, composing the music for about eight thousand songs. His work was based on classical music and tended towards the Thungri style, though he also drew inspiration from other sources. Kamal Dasgupta composed the music for about eighty Bangla films, among them Tufan Mail, Jhamelar Prem, Ei Ki Go Shes Dan. His last film as a music director was Badhu Bharan (1967). He also composed the background music for an American film, War Propaganda. His active life as a composer covered about fourteen years. His unique contribution in music is his invention of a shorthand method for swaralipi (notations). In 1935 Kamal Dasgupta joined the Gramophone Company of India as a music director. During his term there, he developed a close association with Kazi Nazrul Islam and composed the music for almost four hundred of his songs. The gramophone records for which Kamal Dasgupta composed music were very popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Among his songs still popular today are 'Sanjher taraka ami' (I am the star of twilight), 'Prthivi Amare Chay' (The world needs me), and 'Ami bhorer Juthika' (I am the jasmine of morning). In 1956 he was converted to Islam and took the name Kamal Uddin Ahmed. He marriedFeroza Begum, a renowned Nazrul songs singer in the same year. They have three sons, Tahsin Ahmed, Hamin Ahmed and Shafin Ahmed. The later two are also popular singer themselves. Kamal Dasgupta died on 20 July 1974 in Dhaka."

But he did not, disregarding the privileges and rights of the Principality of Samos, which stated that the Prince was appointed according to the will of the Samian people. He left Manolis Pyrgios as his representative to govern the island. Appointed again as Prince of Samos in March 1879, he was welcomed back by the Samians as they remembered his fair ruling. He used to be strict and there was as a result little crimes. No trials took place during this second reign. He fought smuggling and tax favouritism. He settled the economy of the island. However, his second reign was viewed by the Samians as unfair and too strict. He had a lot of administrative skills but he lacked in patience and calmness. He ended up becoming abrupt and arrogant. Thus he lost all of the people's and the parliament's support. He made more and more enemies every day. He ignored the privileges and rights of the Principality of Samos twice. The first time he dismissed the legally elected Parliament and the second he asked the Ottoman government to send 200 soldiers in order to reinforce the two armies that already remained illegally on the island. But he also did some good during his second reign. He constructed the road between Mytilinii and Tigani, the aqueduct of Vathi, a lot of schools, prisons, the Court House in Marathokampos, and more. But the Samians never forgave him for ignoring their rights and privileges. Although the first time the Samian Parliament fought his dismissal, the second time they asked for and obtained it."

He moved to Rjukan in 1915 and started his trade union career here as vice chair of the Rjukan faglige samorg in 1920. He also held this post in 1924 and 1925, and was deputy chair of Rjukan Labour Party in 1920. He was a deputy member of Tinn municipal council from 1919 to 1922 and councilman from 1928 to 1930. In 1927 and 1930 he chaired Rjukan faglige samorg. From 1930 to 1934 he was employed as secretary of Øvre Telemark faglige samorg and Telemark Labour Party.

  "text" : "Kim Kyung-cheon (Hangul: 김경천; hanja: 金擎天; June 5, 1888 – January 2, 1942) was a Korean independence activist and military leader. Several sources believe North Korean leader Kim Il-sung stole his identity after his death. In 1888, he was born in a rich, Yangban-traditioned family in South Hamgyong Province, Pukchong County, as the fifth son of his father Kim Ding-Hyung. His original name was Kim Eung-cheon (Korean: 김응천, Chinese: 金應天). In 1909 he married You Jeong. He later entered the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and graduated in 1911, attaing the rank of cavalry lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Army. In June 1919 he fled to Manchuria along with Ji Cheong-cheon to join the Korean independence movement, working as a trainer but after only six months he communicated with some Korean activists and moved to Vladivostok to fight under Kim Kyu, who was renowned for victory over a Japanese battalion. His main operation after arriving in Vladivostok was fighting off Japanese-supported Chinese militias. In this period he chose Kim Kyung-cheon as a pseudonym. During the Russian Civil War, his troops managed to impress Red Army commanders with good discipline. In January 1923 he attended the conference of Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai and decided to create a communist Korean regime which would be based in the Soviet Union. However, the Comintern denied the \"republic's\" legitimacy as an independent entity, leading Ji to leave the Soviet Union while Kim remained. During the Great Purge, Kim was arrested for protesting against Joseph Stalin's Korean Dislocation policy and eventually died in a Soviet prison. He and Ji Cheong-cheon and Shin Dong-cheon were called \"3 cheons of South Manchuria\" (南满三天). He was also referred to as 擎天金将軍 (경천 김장군) (literally meaning Heaven-supporting General Kim) by Koreans in Manchuria. Lee Myung-young published a book The Legend of Kim Il-sung in 1974 in which she asserted that the original General Kim Il-sung was an Imperial Japanese Army Academy graduate."

  "text" : "Katherine Qiu (born 1947) was a Chinese writer who spoke against Maoism. She is credited with bringing to light many of Mao's abuses, as well as authoring several outspoken criticism of the regime. Her writings are related to Philip Pan's recent publication Out of Mao's Shadow. She was born in 1947 in Yumen City, China. She had seven siblings, many of whom were held as political prisoners after the coming to power of Mao Zedong in 1949. One of her siblings is believed to be historian Qin Hui, whose arguments about Chinese society and history contradicted Mao's beliefs (the name discrepancy is due to alternative spellings and mistranslations to English). In 1973, she travelled to the US to study at Stanford University, but after a year the Communist Party of China demanded that she return to China  After this date, she secretly authored several texts criticizing the Maoist regime and published them via foreign publishers. The last article she published was \"On Mao Zedong's thoughts about population\" in 1984. The authorship of the article is unclear, since Katherine Qiu assumed the pen name R. Qin, which is also the name of another Chinese author."

He founded the theatre group Niwa Gekidan Penino (literally \"garden theatre company Penino\") in 2000 and he writes, directs and designs all productions. He is also a painter and sculptor. His plays are highly surrealistic, filled with bizarre characters and creatures, influenced by Juro Kara. He prefers to use storyboards to writing regular play texts. The design is often very meticulous and colorful, with strange, incongruous elements crammed into small spaces. Influenced by Marcel Duchamp's method of creating miniatures of his work and carrying them around with him, Tanino considers his sets and plays to be like fully formed pictures, arranging performers like parts of an installation or tableaux. His series of \"Hakobune\" (ark) plays were staged at his apartment and involved elaborate sets in spite of the cramped sizes. \"Frustrating Picture Book for Adults\" (2008) was later also staged in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Finland, while \"The Room, Nobody Knows\" (2012) was performed in America in January 2014 and has also been staged in Europe. For \"The Frustrating Picture Book for Adults\" the stage was divided into upper and lower platforms, with the upper part inhabited by two old women, one with a pig’s face and the other with a sheep’s face. In the low-ceilinged room of the set, there is a log piercing the ceiling and another log that pierces the floor between the upper and lower levels. In the lower level a young man in student uniform was tied to one of the trees, causing him to ejaculate when the tree was stroked by the \"pig\" or the \"sheep\". They would then eat the white liquid that came out of the tree. \"The Town Where the Sun and Underwear are seen\" (2009) was staged at Festival/Tokyo 2009 Autumn, while \"Box in the Big Trunk\" (2013), which combined the three Hakobune productions into one \"set\", was performed in Tokyo and Kyoto. He has also directed adaptations of Ibsen and Chekhov."

Crombie worked on the North East jazz scene since the 1960s, starting off at the Downbeat jazz club. In the early 1990s he started the Jazz Café on Pink Lane, a small music venue which he owned and operated until his death in 2012. Crombie was a familiar sight to students at Newcastle University and Northumbria University (most of who know him better as the Jazz man), where he would personally distribute leaflets advertising his venue. While the Jazz Café mostly booked local names and rarely featured any big names, it was often cited as a frequent stop for musicians with business elsewhere in the city. A documentary about Crombie, titled The Jazz Man started filming before his death. Shortly after Crombie's death a group of enthusiasts and local people set up a co-operative to continue his work of promoting jazz. The Jazz Café itself was refurbished and opened again after having been closed for a period after Crombie's death, and is now operated by Newcastle arts centre."

  "text" : "Kathleen Shannon OC (January 1, 1935 – January 9, 1998) was a Canadian film director and producer. She is best known as the founder and executive producer of Studio D of the National Film Board of Canada, the first government-funded film studio dedicated to women filmmakers in the world. Shannon joined the National Film Board in 1956 as a music editor. After Shannon had some 200 films to her credit as an editor she directed her first film, Goldwood in 1974, based on her childhood memories of one of the mining towns where her father, a mining engineer, had worked. She went on to direct a series of 11 shorts in Working Mothers (1974–1975). At this time she began to lobby for a women's film unit at the NFB. In 1974, the National Film Board of Canada created Studio D. Shannon served as executive producer of Studio D from 1975 to 1986, overseeing the production of over 80 films. Under her tutelage, Studio D produced films such as I’ll Find A Way (1977), the Academy Award–winning If You Love This Planet (1980), and Not a Love Story (1981). In 1986 Shannon was named an Officer of the Order of Canada and in the same year she stepped down as executive producer, although she continued to work with the studio until 1992 when she retired. After retirement she moved to the Kootenays where she started a women's guest house and a counselling centre. In a tribute to Shannon, the NFB instituted a documentary film award in her name, to be presented each year at the Yorkton Short Film and Video Festival. One of the last films produced at Studio D before its closure in 1996 was a biographical documentary about Kathleen Shannon called Kathleen Shannon: On Film, Feminism, and Other Dreams, directed by Gerry Rogers. Shannon died of lung cancer at the age of 62."

  "text" : "Karsten Kruschel (born 1959 in Havelberg) is a German science fiction writer, essayist and critic, who lives near Leipzig. His best known works are the Deutscher Science Fiction Preis winning novels Vilm and Galdäa. Some of his short stories were nominated for or won the Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis. Kruschel is the younger son of the writer Heinz Kruschel (1929–2011). He grew up in Magdeburg and studied History and German Philology. Later he became a teacher and a copy editor (amongst others). He received his doctorate in German Philology in 1991 by writing a dissertation about the science fiction literature in the GDR. \"Karsten Kruschel refers to the ambivalence in ambiguous utopie in terms of 'the presence of a variety of possible interpretations'. He uses the category of ambiguous utopia to characterize those novels of this period that were neither utopia or dystopia\", says Sonja Fritzsche about it. His first professional publication was a short story, published in 1979 in German magazine neues leben. His books won the Deutscher Science Fiction Preis twice, in 2010 and 2012. In 2010 he became a freelance writer."

  "text" : "Kim Leslie Plofker (born November 25, 1964) is an American historian of mathematics, specializing in Indian mathematics. Plofker received her bachelor's degree in mathematics from Haverford College. She received her Ph.D. in 1995 while studying with adviser David Pingree (Mathematical Approximation by Transformation of Sine Functions in Medieval Sanskrit Astronomical Texts) from Brown University, where she conducted research and then later was a guest professor. In the late 1990s she was Technical Director of the American Committee for South Asian Manuscripts of the American Oriental Society, where she was also concerned with the development of programs for the text comparison. From 2000 to 2004 she was at the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During 2004 and 2005 she was a visiting professor in Utrecht and at the same time Fellow of the International Institute for Asian Studies in Leiden. She is currently a visiting professor at Union College in Schenectady. Plofker deals with the history of Indian mathematics, the topic of her 2008 book Mathematics in India, which has quickly established itself as a standard work. She is particularly interested in the exchange of mathematics and astronomy between India and Islam in the Middle Ages and generally in the exact sciences between Europe and Asia from antiquity to the 20th Century. In 2010 she gave a plenary lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians, Hyderabad (Indian rules, Yavana rules: foreign identity and the transmission of mathematics). In 2011, she was awarded the Brouwer Medal of the Royal Dutch Mathematical Society. According to David Mumford, besides her book Mathematics in India, \"there is only one other survey, Datta and Singh’s 1938 History of Hindu Mathematics...supplemented by the equally hard to find Geometry in Ancient and Medieval India by Sarasvati Amma (1979)\", where, \"one can get an overview of most topics\" in Indian mathematics."

Critic Gerhard Rohde, summing up Zehelein's theatre work at the Stuttgart opera, says \"Zehelein does not view opera as a culinary phenomenon. For him opera is an extremely complex matter, where all arts – as well as social, philosophical, historic, utopic and other aspects – unite. This complexity of opera merits being perceived, being seen, being experienced; thus all works that end up performed on stage, are rigorously analyzed beforehand. He who says this results in thinned-out, merely sophisticated opera performances, missed out substantially in the Zehelein-Era in Stuttgart.\""

  "text" : "Knud Reimers (1906–1987) was one of the most important Scandinavian yacht designers of the 20th century. He was born in Denmark and educated as a shipwright in Germany at Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft in the twenties, a yard building large sailing and motoryachts at the time. He worked as apprentice at Abeking & Rasmussen in (Bremen-)Lemwerder under the supervision of Henry Rasmussen. His first employment was in Stockholm at the design studio of the famous naval architect Gustaf Estlander. When Estlander suddenly died at the age of 54 in 1930, the 25-year-old Reimers bought his design practice. He promptly sold six 22m² Skerry cruisers to the Detroit Yacht Club. He later drew plans for the great 75m² Skerry cruiser Bacchant (II) that furthered his reputation as a designer of fast cruisers and racers. Reimers most celebrated construction is the Tumlare which was designed in the early 1930s (1933 from a majority of sources; No. 1, 'Aibe' was built the next year for Bengt Kinde), and became a popular class worldwide. Examples are to be found all round the Baltic, in the UK, North America and Australia. After owning the Tumlare Zara, Adlard Coles bought a 32' Large Tumlare Cohoe, with which he won the Transatlantic Race of 1950. Reimers went on to design cruisers, offshore racers and a large number of exclusive sailing and motor yachts. Reimers boats are available in numerous countries worldwide and boats are still built to his designs. His drawing archives are at the Maritime Museum in Stockholm. Reimers also designed Motor yachts, e.g. Orwell Class, 25’, (Yachting World 1938) and Swedish Express, 50’, (Yachting World 1938). Reimers was also a lecturer, and produced films of races like the Tall Ships Race, Bermuda Race, Fastnet Race and Atlantic Race. Knud Reimers argued that in offshore race sailing, the final test is to create boats that can travel at sea in any weather, and said (loosely translated): \"The boat is the means to reach the treasure beyond the horizon\"."

  "text" : "Ken Birman (born November 18, 1955) is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University. He is best known for developing the Isis Toolkit, which introduced the virtual synchrony execution model for multicast communication and then and founding a company, Isis Distributed Systems, that used it as the basis for a wide range of robust software solutions for stock exchanges, air traffic control, and factory automation. Although the company no longer exists, Isis operated the New York and Swiss Stock Exchanges for more than a decade, and continues to be actively used in the French air traffic control system and the US Navy AEGIS warship. The technology permits these and other systems to automatically adapt themselves when failures or other disruptions occur, to securely share keys and security policy data, and to replicate critical services so that availability can be maintained even while some system components are down. A new version of the Isis technology, called Vsync, is now available as an open-source free library. Other widely cited systems from his Cornell research effort include the Bimodal Multicast  (a probabilistically reliable broadcast protocol that uses the gossip paradigm) and Astrolabe  (a scalable tool for monitoring, data mining and managing large systems). An ACM Fellow and IEEE Fellow, Birman is also the author of several books, most recently \"Reliable Distributed Computing: Technologies, Web Services, and Applications\", which was published by Springer-Verlag in May 2007. He was Editor in Chief of ACM Transactions on Computer Systems from 1993-1998. Birman’s primary research emphasis is currently concerned with the scalability of distributed systems, security technologies, and system management tools employed in cloud computing systems."

  "text" : "Baron  Kumakichi Nakajima  (中島久万吉 Nakajima Kumakichi, 24 July 1873 – 25 April 1960) was an entrepreneur, politician and cabinet minister in the pre-war Empire of Japan. Nakajima was born in Yokohama. His father Baron Nakajima Nobuyuki was from Kōchi Prefecture, was the first Speaker of the House of Representatives of Japan and Japanese ambassador to Italy. Nakajima initially entered Meiji University, but left without graduating, and obtained a degree from the Higher Commercial School (the predecessor to Hitotsubashi University) in 1897, obtaining a position at the Tokyo Stock Exchange on graduation. In 1899, he became secretary to Prime Minister Katsura Tarō and in 1906 served as secretary to Prime Minister Saionji Kinmochi. In 1907, Nakajima went to work for the mining consortium Fukukawa Kogyo. He helped establish Josai University in 1918. In 1920, Nakajima was instrumental in joining Furukawa Electric, Fuji Electric, Yokohama Rubber and a number of smaller companies into the Furukawa Consortium, one of the 15 largest zaibatsu in pre-war Japan. In 1927, he was an influential member of the Deliberation Council within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, pushing for increased compilation of industrial statistics, loans to small and medium businesses and export industries, and the adoption of the metric system. In 1932, Nakajima joined the Saito Makoto administration as Minister of Commerce and Industry. In 1921, on viewing a wooden statue of Ashikaga Takauji at the temple of Seiken-ji in Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka, Nakajima had contributed a haiku poem to a literary magazine. He commented that the official educational policy vilifying Ashikaga Takauji as a traitor to the nation for his betrayal of Emperor Go-Daigo should be re-evaluated. The article was discovered by ultrarightists and militarists eager to find leverage to embarrass and to bring down the Saito administration. Nakajima was called before the House of Peers, where he was browbeaten by retired General Baron Takeo Kikuchi and others, who forced his resignation on 2 February 1934, a date making the 600th anniversary of the Kemmu restoration. In 1937, Nakajima was one of 16 officials arrested on trumped-up charges of corruption in the Teijin Incident. He was subsequently cleared of all charges after a lengthy trial, but withdrew from public service after this event. After the surrender of Japan, Nakajima emerged from seclusion to become chairman of the Japan Trade Association in 1950. In 1955, he became president of the radio company, Nippon Cultural Broadcasting. He died at his villa in Hayama, Kanagawa in 1960. He was posthumously awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 1st class."

  "text" : "Kamekichi Tokita (1897–1948) was a Japanese American painter and diarist. He immigrated to the United States from Japan in 1919, and lived in Seattle, Washington's Japantown/Nihonmachi district (now the International District). He was a prominent figure in the Pacific Northwest art world of the 1930s, with paintings regularly included in major exhibitions. During World War II, Tokita and his family were forced to move to the Minidoka Relocation Center in Idaho. His detailed, deeply expressive diary and sketches he made there were later published and recognized as important records of the Japanese American wartime experience. Tokita died in Seattle in 1948."

  "text" : "Kenneth \"Ken\" Upchurch (born June 4, 1969) is the publisher of the Monticello Stage, a community newspaper in Monticello in Wayne County, Kentucky, who is a Republican member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from District 52, which encompasses Wayne, McCreary, and a portion of Pulaski counties in the south-central portion of the state. Upchurch held this seat from January 1999 to December 2010 and then returned after a two-year hiatus to the position early in 2013. Upchurch is a son of Martin L. Upchurch of Monticello and the former Barbara Jackson (1948-2013). He and his wife Melissa, have a daughter, Chelsea Upchurch. He has two brothers, Keith Upchurch of Monticello and Timothy Upchurch of Lexington, Kentucky. His maternal grandfather is the Reverend James Howard Jackson of Mt. Orab, Ohio. Upchurch received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Eastern Kentucky University in his native Richmond, Kentucky. At EKU, he was the student body president and an automatic member of the university board of regents. He is a member of the Elk Spring Valley Baptist Church in Monticello. In his first race for the House, buoyed by a large vote in Wayne County, Upchurch won the Republican nomination over three opponents by a margin of some seven hundred votes. In the general election, he defeated the Democrat Arthur J. Bolze of Somerset by a wide margin, 8,505 (75.7 percent) to 2,736 (24.3 percent) As a legislator, Upchurch developed a reputation for his support of small business and agriculture. In 2002, his colleagues elected him as the House Republican whip, a position which he filled for two terms and helped to craft the state budget. He did not seek a seventh two-year term in 2010 and was succeeded by fellow Republican, Sara Beth Gregory, a lawyer from Monticello. Instead Upchurch was defeated in a bid for Wayne County Judge-Executive. After just two years in the state House, Gregory won a special election to the Kentucky State Senate in December 2012 to succeed long-term State Senate President David L. Williams of Burkesville in Cumberland County. Upchurch won back the seat that he had vacated barely two years earlier, when he defeated the Democrat Harvey Shearer, also of Monticello in a low-turnout special election held on February 12, 2013. The leadership of both parties selected Upchurch and Shearer as their nominees."

  "text" : "Kyle Snyder (born November 20, 1995) is an American Olympic Gold Medal amateur wrestler who amassed a 179–0 record in his first three years of high school before becoming the youngest American in over 20 years to win a FILA Junior World championship in August 2013. Snyder was coached by two former World Champions during his gold medal match: Bill Zadick of the Iowa Hawkeyes, who was a college teammate of Jeff McGinness, the youngest ever American FILA Junior World Champion who won the tournament in 1992, as well as Zeke Jones. Although Snyder was unable to repeat his gold medal run in 2014, he brought home a bronze medal, and in the process became the youngest two-time Junior World medalist in American history. Before bringing home his Junior World title in 2013, Snyder had already decided to forgo his senior year of high school competition and instead compete internationally as a resident athlete at the United States Olympic Training Center beginning in the fall of 2013. In the spring of 2014, at 18 years of age, Snyder was selected to represent Team USA as the youngest-ever member of the Beat the Streets All-Star team that faced off against top-ranked wrestlers from across the world, where he wrestled alongside fellow Americans with multiple NCAA championships and Olympic gold medals such as David Taylor, Brent Metcalf and Jordan Burroughs. Snyder, who competes internationally at 96 kg, lost a tightly contested exhibition match 6–3 against Khadzhimurat Gatsalov, the No. 1-ranked wrestler in the world at 120 kg who at 31 years old had won five World Championships and an Olympic gold medal. A few weeks later, Snyder secured a place on his second consecutive United States Junior World Team, winning by technical fall in the national finals. Snyder hoped to repeat his championship run at the Junior World Championships in 2014, though fell short and lost to Georgy Gogaev of Russia from North Ossetia-Alania in the quarterfinals, and wrestled back for a bronze. Earlier in 2014, Gogaev had defeated two former Division I (NCAA) champions Dustin Kilgore and Cam Simaz, both of whom had won their NCAA titles years earlier, in 2011 and 2012 respectively – while Snyder was still competing in high school."

  "text" : "Katherine Rosalind Muggeridge (née Dobbs, born 8 December 1903 – 11 June 1994) was a British writer and translator. She was born in Chateau d'Oex, Switzerland, where her parents, the former Rosalind Potter (Beatrice Webb's sister) and George Dobbs, were then living. Stafford Cripps was a cousin. The family returned to England when hostilities in the Great War began and she attended Bedales School, and briefly, in her early 20s, the London School of Economics. In 1927 she married the journalist Malcolm Muggeridge, and the couple eventually had three sons and a daughter. With his wife, Muggeridge was posted to the Soviet Union in 1932 by the Manchester Guardian. Then admirers of the Bolsheviks, the couple described this as \"a wondrous development\", but quickly became completely disillusioned when they saw what was happening in the country. Kitty's aunt, Beatrice Webb, who with her husband Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield had recently defended the Soviet Union in their book Soviet Communism: A New Civilization?, called Muggeridge's Manchester Guardian articles \"an hysterical tirade\", but was more restrained in her private communications with the couple. With Ruth Adam, she wrote Beatrice Webb: A Life 1858-1943 (1967), which although more a memoir than a scholarly book, was positively reviewed at the time. Her opinion of broadcaster David Frost dating from 1967, \"he rose without a trace\", has been much quoted over the years. Like her husband, she became an admirer of the Calcutta based nun Mother Teresa, about whom she wrote in a book entitled Bright Legacy (1983), a work published the year after the couple had become Catholics. In this period she translated two books by Jean Pierre de Caussade, the 18th century French Jesuit priest. Following the death of her husband in 1990, Kitty Muggeridge lived with her son John and daughter-in-law in Welland, Ontario, Canada, where she died in June 1994."

On 20 August 1930 he was arrested and sent to jail on six months' rigorous imprisonment. That was the beginning of his active involvement in politics. Later along with many members of the radical socialist group of the Congress party he quit the parent organisation and joined the  Communist Party of India where he still continues. His autobiography 'Payaswiniyude Theerangalil'(On the Banks of river Payaswini) is considered a valuable document of a transformative epoch in modern Kerala history.

Bragg of Port Arthur, Texas. In 1972, Bragg received a Bachelor of Science degree in forestry from Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas. He has since that time been employed in the forestry industry, including a 25-year commitment to International Paper Company. In 2006, he joined Resource Management Service, in which capacity he oversees forest management activities on 300,000 acres in Arkansas. He is a member of the executive committee of the Arkansas Forestry Association. In 2013, the Arkansas Timber Producers Association named Bragg \"Legislator of the Year\" for his sponsorship of legislation to eliminate the sales tax on forestry equipment, a move which the association contends will make the timber industry more competitive with its counterparts in surrounding states. Bragg and his wife, Beverly J. Bragg (born 1951), originally from Port Arthur, Texas, have a son, Aaron Christopher Bragg (born 1977), a Certified Public Accountant in Little Rock, who in 2013 wed the assistant U.S. attorney Allison Courtney Waldrip.

Returning from World War I he studied Latin and German history in Leipzig. His publication of 1924 directed international attention to the Frankish chroniclers of the Carolingian epoch. From 1924 to 1945 he taught history in many Gymnasien and state high schools, in Leipzig, Waldenburg in Saxony and eventually in Dresden. Through collaboration with Fritz Rörig he joined the team producing the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, where he concentrated on Early Medieval literary texts. In 1958 appeared his editions of Gunzo's Epistola ad Augienses,and Anselm of Besate's, Rhetorimachia. In several articles and monographs he examined the history of medieval libraries. Following his move to Bavaria in 1969 there finally appeared in Weimar his editions of Sextus Amarcius's Sermones, over which he had been labouring since 1955. In 1973 appeared his edition of Eupolemius's Messiade. He died in Bernried."

  "text" : "Ken Frieden (born 1955) is the B.G. Rudolph Professor of Judaic Studies— and a full professor in the Departments of English, Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics, and Religion — at Syracuse University. He writes about, edits, and promotes Hebrew, Yiddish, and other Jewish literature. Born in New Rochelle, New York, he received a B.A. from Yale University in 1977, and went on to complete a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature there in 1984. At Yale he studied with Harold Bloom, Jacques Derrida, Geoffrey Hartman, Paul de Man, and J. Hillis Miller. Based on his dissertation, his first book was Genius and Monologue. The book used key-word analysis of “genius” to show how intellectual history parallels literary history. Frieden’s second book, Freud’s Dream of Interpretation, juxtaposed Freudian interpretation and medieval rabbinic interpretation, arguing that in spite of marked similarities, Freud made efforts to deflect attention from this. From 1985 to 1986, Frieden was a Lady Davis Post-Doctoral Fellow in Jerusalem. During that time he studied Yiddish and Hebrew literature with Khone Shmeruk and Dan Miron at the Hebrew University. While teaching at Emory University (1986–1993), Frieden focused his research and teaching on twentieth-century Hebrew literature and nineteenth-century Yiddish fiction. He held a Yad Hanadiv Fellowship in Jerusalem (1988–1989), working closely with Aharon Appelfeld and James Young. While at Emory he published numerous articles and received tenure and promotion to associate professor in 1990. Frieden was hired by Syracuse University in 1993. Since then he has published and edited several books. His comprehensive study Classic Yiddish Fiction (1995) surveys the three major authors S. Y. Abramovitsh, Sholem Aleichem, and I. L. Peretz. Collaborating with Dan Miron, he edited Tales of Mendele the Book Peddler, later reprinted by Random House. Collaborating with Ted Gorelick, he edited a new English translation of Sholem Aleichem's monologues, published as Nineteen to the Dozen. With a secondary interest in Israeli art, he commissioned the jacket cover print, \"The World of Sholem Aleichem,\" from the Russian-Israeli artist Boris Luchanski. By a fortuitous coincidence, Frieden arrived in Syracuse during the same year that Robert Mandel became director of Syracuse University Press. They created the series Judaic Traditions in Literature, Music, and Art, which has produced more than 50 volumes at the Press. Frieden edited the anthology Classic Yiddish Stories of S. Y. Abramovitsh, Sholem Aleichem, and I. L. Peretz, including his own translations of Abramovitsh and Peretz, Ted Gorelick's translations of Sholem Aleichem's monologues, and Michael Wex's translations of Sholem Aleichem's Tevye stories. His influence has been felt in many other books on Yiddish and Hebrew literary culture he has edited. Recently he edited collections of Hebrew short stories in English translation by Etgar Keret and David Ehrlich. Frieden has traveled repeatedly in Eastern Europe to explore the remnants of Jewish culture there, particularly in Lithuania, Ukraine, and Poland. He has been a visiting professor or research fellow at the universities in Tel Aviv, Haifa, Jerusalem, Berlin, and Heidelberg; also stateside at University of California, Davis and Harvard. Frieden’s most recent research shows the significance of travel narratives in Hebrew literature, at the fault line between the Enlightenment and Hasidism. He is also active as a Klezmer clarinetist, having founded “The Wandering Klezmorim” in Atlanta in 1991. He often performs with “The Wandering Klezmorim” and “Klezmercuse” at festive events in Central New York."

  "text" : "Ku Min-Jung (also Gu Min-Jeong, Korean: 구 민정; born August 25, 1973 in Jeollabuk-do) is a retired female South Korean volleyball player. She represented South Korea in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), and also often played as an outside hitter and attacker. Ku was also a member of the South Korea women's national volleyball team who attained a great success in the late 1990s and early 2000s, capturing two silver medals each at the Asian Men's Volleyball Championship (1993 and 1997) and at the Asian Games (1998 and 2002). Ku made her official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where she competed as a member of the South Korean squad in the women's volleyball tournament. Collecting a total of three triumphs, two losses, and eight classification points in the preliminary pool, the South Koreans lost the quarterfinal match to the U.S. squad, led by Kerri Walsh (who later turned into a beach volleyball player in the next three Olympics), with a five-score set of 24–26, 25–17, 23–25, 27–25, 14–16. During the fifth round of the match, Ku returned a ball down the left line that was called out and ended into a protest against the aggressive Americans. After suffering a heavy defeat in the quarterfinals, the South Korean squad finished eighth in a classification round match against Croatia with a set score of 1–3. When South Korea hosted the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, Ku helped the South Koreans capture the silver medal in a final match against China with a set score of 1–3. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Ku qualified for the second time as a member and captain of the South Korean squad in the women's volleyball tournament after receiving an automatic berth from the Asian Championships. Unable to improve a fair performance from Sydney, she and the rest of the South Korean team were defeated in the quarterfinal match against Russia with a unanimous set score of 0–3 (17–25, 15–25, 22–25). Ku was also appointed as the flag bearer for Korea, along with former basketball coach Kim Sung-Ho, under a joint march in the opening ceremony."

  "text" : "Katya Mandoki is a scholar of philosophy, author and experimental artist born in Mexico City (1947) from Jewish Hungarian immigrant parents. Mandoki pioneered the systematic research of Everyday Aesthetics coining the term \"Prosaics\" (1994) for this subfield of Aesthetics. In her book Everyday Aesthetics, the first extended treatment of this subject, she opens up the study of aesthetics –traditionally confined to art and beauty– to encompass all those aspects involving sensibility in common experience using the human body as a starting point for this analysis. Her work covers not only the positive aspect of aesthetics but also its negative side such as cruelty and abuse upon someone's sensibility, never before thought of in those terms. She stresses the danger of political manipulation of sensibility illustrated by the propagandistic use of aesthetics specifically during the Nazi regime. From Mandoki's work on the negativity of aesthetics Arnold Berleant takes off to analyze this issue in relation to terrorism. The subfield of everyday aesthetics is so fertile that it has been followed and enriched by a number of contemporary aestheticians. Mandoki has published eight books on this topic, the most recent presenting and developing the concept of bio-aesthetics that traces sensibility not only in humans but in the most elemental creatures from an evolutionary perspective. She is a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences, of the National System of Researchers (SNI), and Founder and Honorary Member of the Mexican Association of Aesthetics (AMEST) serving as President from 2007–2011. She has been professor of aesthetics and semiotics at Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM) in Mexico where she established and chaired postgraduate specialization studies in Aesthetics, Semiotics and Theory of Culture, has taught postgraduate level at National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and given courses for Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes and Universidad Iberoamericana. She received the National Prize for Arts in experimental work (1982, 1985) by the INBA, the Prize for Academic Research by UAM (1995, 2007, 2015) and participated in various individual and collective artwork exhibitions at museums and galleries such as Palacio de Bellas Artes on several occasions. Her monumental sculpture Histogram on the distribution of income in Mexico can be visited at the Library Plaza in the Xochimilco Campus of UAM. Mandoki published more than 150 articles on aesthetics and semiotics and presented papers and lectures in 20 countries. Presently Mandoki serves at the International Association of Aesthetics' Executive Committee (IAA), at the International Advisory Board of International Institute of Applied Aesthetics, Finland, and at the International Editorial Board of various academic journals such as Contemporary Aesthetics, Cultural Politics, and Environment, Land, Society, Architectonics."

  "text" : "Kita Fumiko (喜多 文子, 1875 – 1950) was an important Japanese professional 8-dan go player. Born Shiba Fumi, she was adopted by Hayashi Sano, a strong Meiji-era player and member of the Hayashi house. Fumiko achieved the professional rank of 1-dan at the Hoensha in 1889 and married the famous Noh actor, Kita Roppeita, in 1895, after which she was known as Kita Fumiko. After some years away from go she resumed her career in 1907 and rose through the ranks, reaching 6-dan in 1938. In 1924, at the time of the formation of the Nihon Ki-in, she played a key role as a mediator between rival factions. She is known affectionately as the mother of women's go in Japan; virtually all of the women professionals before the second world war were her pupils. There is an essay titled \"The Art of Resigning\" in Noriyuki Nakayama's book The Treasure Chest Enigma describing young Fumiko's difficult relationship with her mother, Hayashi Sano. A more detailed article may be found on Sensei's Library. In recognition of her contributions to modern go she was inducted into the Nihon Ki-in Hall of Fame in 2013."

However, in 1809 he switched sides and joined the army of Duchy of Warsaw to take part in the short Polish–Austrian War as an adjutant to his uncle, General Kazimierz Turno. Promoted to the rank of Captain in 1811, he took part in all campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars between 1812 and 1814. After the war he returned to Warsaw, was promoted to Colonel and became a cavalry instructor and an adjutant to Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia. Following the outbreak of the November Uprising he personally escorted the Grand Duke to the Russian border, and then returned to Warsaw to join the ranks of the Polish Army. A chief of staff of the Polish cavalry forces, in May 1831 he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General and became the commanding officer of the Cavalry Brigade, and then the Cavalry Division. After the Battle of Warsaw he remained in the city, was arrested by the Russians and sentenced to forcible resettlement to Perm. Pardoned in 1833, he returned to Russian-held Poland and bought a small manor near Grodno. Later in his life he moved to the manor of Objezierze near Poznań, where he died 10 March 1860."

  "text" : "Karlheinz Pintsch (1909 -?) was the long serving senior adjutant to Rudolf Hess who was the Deputy Führer to Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany. It fell to him to report Hess's illegal May 1941 flight to Scotland to Hitler and his recollections and notes have been the subject of debate by historians. Pintsch entered the Nazi Party in 1925 and in 1934 he became the adjutant to Hess, attaining the rank of Sturmbannführer (major). He accompanied him on visits to Augsburg-Haunstetten airfield where he was learning to fly the aircraft that he flew to Scotland on 10 May 1941. Before he departed on his mission Hess gave Pintsch a sealed letter for him to deliver personally to Adolf Hitler if he did not return within four hours and Pintsch handed it to him at the Berghof in Bavaria at noon the next day. Albert Speer who was in the vicinity recalled that Hitler bellowed for Martin Bormann after reading the letter. Bormann ordered the arrest of Hess's associates and Pinstch was cashiered from the SS and interrogated by the Gestapo. He was then jailed for his knowledge of the flight and held in solitary confinement, as was Hess’s other adjutant Alfred Leitgen. On 7 August 1941 Hess wrote to his wife and included a letter to Pintsch in which he said he had heard rumours that he had been arrested and thanked him for his loyalty and his silence. Pintsch was released from prison in 1944 to serve on the Eastern Front and was promoted to lieutenant. He was captured by the Red Army, betrayed by another prisoner and interrogated by the NKVD at length. They reportedly tried to elicit a confession by breaking his fingers and as a consequence he was no longer able to use a knife and fork. He was released with 600 other prisoners of war at Camp Friedland, Lower Saxony, after 11 years in Soviet captivity on 16 December 1955. He was interviewed by Lord Beaverbrook's former private secretary, the Daily Express foreign correspondent James Leasor. and was interviewed for a 1962 book by Leasor that was entitled Rudolf Hess: The Uninvited Envoy. A 28-page notebook written by Pintsch in captivity in 1948 was discovered in a Moscow archive in 2010 by historians. It suggested that Hitler was in on the mission by Hess and interrogation transcripts found in the same archive record his recollection that when Hitler had read Hess's letter he remarked calmly: \"At this particular moment in the war that could be a most hazardous escapade\"."

In 2003, the National Lesbian & Gay Journalists Association gave Thomas a Lifetime Achievement Award. Thomas was born in Los Angeles in 1936.

  "text" : "Kathleen Mary Losinska, OBE (née Conway; 5 October 1922 – 16 October 2013) was a leading moderate trade unionist in Britain, involved in the Civil and Public Services Association and associated with David Stirling. She was born in Croydon, the daughter of a soldier, and attended Selhurst Grammar School. She entered the civil service at age 17 in the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, later marrying a Polish air ace, Stanisław Losinski in 1942, which informed her opposition to communism. In 1975 she was elected President of the Civil and Public Services Association (CPSA) for the first time, beating her nearest rival by 10,000 votes, although she was deposed the following year. She re-took the position from 1979-82, the position going to Militant supporter Kevin Roddy in 1982, before Losinska was re-elected once more from 1983-86. Throughout much of this period she allied herself with Alistair Graham who became CPSA General Secretary from 1982-86. Losinska's presidencies were surrounded by controversies. During the first year of her presidency she had taken the union's executive after they had censured her for her comments in an article in Readers Digest, where she had said the union was being infiltrated by Trotskyists and Marxists and wished to reply to her in the union's journal, Red Tape. As chair of the Solidarnosc Foundation, she clashed with Arthur Scargill over his criticisms of Polish trade union Solidarnosc, and later appointed Knight Commander of the Order of Polonia Restituta. Her opposition to a merger with the Society of Civil and Public Servants in 1986 led to a split in the Moderate group into Losinska's National Moderate Group and the Democratic Moderate Group. She chaired the Trade Union Committee for European and Transatlantic Understanding, a body funded by NATO and the US Congress."

  "text" : "Kadir Nurman (c.1933 – 24 October 2013) was a Turkish-born German restaurateur, widely credited with having in 1972, in West Berlin, introduced or \"invented\" the fast food sandwich commonly known as the \"kebab\" (German: der Döner), consisting of traditional Turkish döner kebab meat stuffed together with mixed salad into a flatbread. Nurman received a lifetime achievement award from the Association of Turkish Döner Manufacturers in 2011. Afterwards, Nurman told the German magazine Frankfurter Rundschau that he was unhappy with modern döner kebab sandwiches, as \"there are too many ingredients\" in them. Several people have been credited with being the \"inventor of the döner kebab\" in Germany, but such claims - including that for Nurman - are widely considered inaccurate. The familiar rotating döner kebab meat, roasted on a vertical spit and sliced with a sword, has been well known in Turkey since the mid-1800s. Its invention is generally credited to İskender Efendi of Bursa. Introduced in Nurman's native Istanbul in the 1940s by restaurateurs such as Beyti Güler, it became a world-famous delicacy. Döner kebab has been sold in sandwich form there since at least the mid-1960s. The Greek variation of the Turkish döner kebab, the gyro, was already a popular sandwich item in Athens and in New York City by 1971. Nurman himself did not claim to be the first person to have sold a sandwich of döner kebab meat even in Germany, saying in German: \"Maybe someone else also did it, in some hidden corner, but no one noticed. The kebab became well-known through me.\" Nevertheless, Nurman's prototypical kebab shop at West Berlin's busy central train station was a harbinger of a global trend, and his early version of the staple street snack was the framework upon which Berlin's Turkish Gastarbeiter community developed the distinctive style that has become one of the top-selling fast foods in Germany and much of Europe, and has spread around the world."

  "text" : "Pushpa Kapila Hingorani was an Indian lawyer who is regarded as \"Mother of Public Interest Litigation\" (PIL). As per then prevailing laws, a petition could be filed only by a victim or a relative. Kapila and her husband Nirmal Hingorani wanted to represent the undertrial prisoners in Bihar. The couple acting on a novel idea, filed a habeas corpus petition on the prisoners’ behalf before the Supreme Court of India. Two weeks after Kapila argued the case in court, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Bihar government, which led to the release of all the victims in the case, and eventually about 40,000 undertrials across the country. The landmark case came to be known as the Hussainara Khatoon case. Hussainara was one of the six women prisoners. This earned her the title the \"Mother of PILs\". This case gave rise to a revolution in the Indian legal system. She also revealed the Bhagalpur Blindings, resulting in the Supreme Court directing that the policemen who tortured 33 criminals be prosecuted and the victims released with medical aid and pension for life. She is the first Indian woman to have studied at Cardiff Law School. A plaque has been erected in her honour at Aberdare Hall. Kapila also undertook the petition where police had blinded 33 suspected criminals using needles and acid, after a lawyer from Bihar wrote to her about the atrocities. Eventually, the Supreme Court ordered medical aid, compensation and pension for life to all the victims. Kapila died on 31 December 2013 at age of 86."
