Jones was educated at Brasenose College at Oxford (Fellowship at All Souls, 1569) and married Mabel Ussher, sister of James Ussher (later Primate of All Ireland) in Ireland c. 1602. Irish historian James Ware claimed he was called \"the vivacious Bishop of Killaloe\" for having married a young wife at the age of threescore (60). He held several church posts in Ireland, finally becoming Bishop of Killaloe in 1633. His Puritan leanings were deplored by Archbishop Laud, but he remained in office until his death in 1646 at the reputed age of 104. He was buried in St. Werburgh's Church, Dublin. He was Dean of Ardagh (1606–1625) and Dean of Cashel (1609-1633), when he renovated Cashel Cathedral and instituted a choir there. Two of his sons were themselves bishops – Henry Jones (1605–1682) and Ambrose Jones (d. 1678). Three other sons, Michael Jones (d. 1649), Oliver Jones (d. 1664), and Theophilus Jones (d. 1685), were soldiers and politicians."

  "text" : "Lester Breslow (March 17, 1915, in Bismarck, ND, United States – April 9, 2012, in Los Angeles) was an American physician who promoted public health. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Minnesota, which is also where he received his MD and MPH. Breslow served in the United States Army during World War II, and when he returned took a position with the California State Department of Public Health. While in medical school, he was studying to be a psychiatrist and, as a junior, he worked for a summer in the Fergus Falls Minnesota State Hospital for the Insane. His experience there left him discouraged once he realized that in that time, there was not much they could do for those patients except keep them out of harm's way. When he returned to medical school for his senior year, he told a friend of his, also a faculty member, about his feelings and was introduced to a new professor of public health, Gaylord Anderson. Anderson was the one that got Breslow set on a career in epidemiology. Breslow was considered an exemplary doctor as well as a genuinely good person. In an obituary written by one of his former protégées it says, \"I was one of Lester's preventative medicine residents 15 years ago…Having had an opportunity to observe him engage with 'paupers' and 'kings,' I can attest to his treatment of all with respect and appreciation for their humanity, abilities, and contributions. I can also attest to his refusal to accept anything less than the best, from others (like me!) and particularly, from himself.\""

He resided on the Ladd farm, south of Fowler's River. In 1853 Luther and his father moved to Alexandria, NH where Luther attended district schools. Ladd left Alexandria in 1860, and journeyed to Lowell, Massachusetts where he obtained employment at the Lowell Machine Shop. In April 1861 Luther answered President Lincoln's first call for 75,000 men by enlisting for three months in Co. D, 6th Regt., Massachusetts Volunteers. On April 19, 1861 while marching through the city of Baltimore this regiment was attacked by an angry mob. Luther C. Ladd was the first to fall. His injuries included a fractured skull and a fatal bullet wound that severed an artery in his thigh. Luther C. Ladd's remains were interred in the Alexandria Village Cemetery, later to be removed and buried beneath the Ladd & Whitney monument in Lowell, Mass <RootsWeb>"

From 1889 until 1894 she was a lecturer at Royal Holloway College and then joined King's College London, where she succeeded Cornelia Schmitz as vice-principal of the Ladies Department for the next 13 years, a position she regarded as the happiest of her career. She was principal of Cheltenham Ladies' College from 1907 until 1922. In 1920, she became Justice of the Peace for Cheltenham, becoming one of the first women magistrates in England. Faithfull started the organisation that is now Lilian Faithfull Homes in Cheltenham, and she spent the last few months of her life in the care of one of the homes, Faithfull House, until her death in 1952."

  "text" : "Leon McCarron (born 1986) is a Northern Irish adventurer and filmmaker. He grew up in Articlave, Northern Ireland and attended Ballyhackett Primary School and Dalriada Grammar. He studied Film at the University of Kent, and subsequently set off on a 14,000 mile bicycle ride from New York to Hong Kong. It took him 14 months to complete, and film footage from the journey was used in the cycling magazine show 'Better Than Four.' A book about this adventure will be published in summer 2014. Upon finishing the ride, he immediately began planning the next adventure - joining Rob Lilwall on a 3000-mile walk across China. National Geographic Channel commissioned a 4-part series, and McCarron signed up as primary cameraman for the journey. Together, with no support crew, he and Lilwall completed the walk in just over 6 months, starting in Sainshand, Mongolia, crossing the Gobi Desert, walking along the Great Wall, down the Yellow River, through Xi'an in central China and finally finishing in Hong Kong on 26 May 2012. The TV series, Walking Home From Mongolia  premiered in Autumn 2013 on the Nat Geo Adventure Channel. Since then, McCarron has also trekked 1000 miles through the Empty Quarter desert with adventurer Alastair Humphreys, using explorer and author Wilfred Thesiger as their inspiration. Together McCarron and Humpheys filmed the journey, and the resulting film, Into The Empty Quarter, was premiered at the Royal Geographical Society in London in November 2013. McCarron now lives in London, and works as a motivational speaker and writer (contributing to publications such as the Sunday Times and the Guardian.) In the summer of 2013 he will take on a new UK-based expedition."

  "text" : "Leo Mittler (1893–1958) was an Austrian playwright, screenwriter and film director. Mittler was born in Vienna, then the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to a Jewish family. He attended the University of Music and Performing Arts and worked as a playwright and director in the German theatre. Mittler then switched to work in the booming German film industry during the silent era. Mittler's best known film as director was Beyond the Street (1929), a \"street film\" influenced by Soviet cinema. As well as his work in the German industry, Mittler also spent time at the American company Paramount's French language-subsidiary based at the Joinville Studios in Paris. Following the Nazi rise to power in 1933, Mittler spent many years in exile in several countries including Britain and France before settling in the United States during the Second World War. Mittler's career as a director had all but ended in the mid-1930s, after making the Stanley Lupino musical comedy Cheer Up (1936), but he worked occasionally as a screenwriter. Mittler wrote the original story of the MGM pro-Soviet film Song of Russia (1944) which was later investigated by HUAC for its alleged communist sympathies. Mittler returned to Germany post-war, and died there in 1958. Before his death, he worked for German theatre and television."

  "text" : "Luciano Nezzo (Badia Polesine, September, 1856 – Urbino, 1903) was an Italian painter, painting both history and genre subjects. The genre subjects are often poignant and dramatic. He was born in the Province of Rovigo in the Veneto. He showed an inclination to arts since a young age, and had locally as a first master Marco Vallerini. A local patron, sponsored his education at the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice, where he studied for ten years. At the age of twenty, he had already won a gold medal for his composition: Tasso at Eleonora d'Este's deathbed and Leonardo da Vinci painting the Madonna Lisa. He exited the Accademia to enlist as a soldier in the War of Italian independence. Stationed with the 41st regiment in Milan, he enrolled in the Brera Academy. Returning to the Veneto, he was awarded a professorship in painting at the Academy of Fine Arts of Urbino. Among two paintings sent to the 1887 Esposizione of Rovigo, which earned a silver medal; Portrait of King Umberto and Invitati a pranzo. Among his other works are:Alla finestra (1884, Turin exhibition); Buon giorno, (1883, Rome exhibition); Mastro Piero; The thief, Rebecca, and many portraits. Some of his subjects recall the tense episodes depicted by Gaspare Traversi; for example, his painting of an elderly dental surgeon examining his young female patient's mouth, while hiding his tooth extractor behind his back."

  "text" : "Leon Quartermaine (24 September 1876 – 25 June 1967) was a British actor whose stage career, in Britain and the United States, extended from the early 1900s to the 1950s. He was born in Richmond, London, and educated at the Whitgift School in Croydon, where one of his contemporaries was The Revd Harold Davidson, later unfrocked while Rector of Stiffkey. The pair acted together in a school production of the farce Sent to the Tower. In 1921 Quartermaine appeared with Fay Compton in a West End revival of J. M. Barrie's play Quality Street. In February 1922 Quartermaine and Compton married, and remained so until their divorce in 1942. Quartermaine made numerous appearances on Broadway between 1903 and 1935, including Laertes (Hamlet, 1904), Lieutenant Osborne in the American premiere of R. C. Sherriff's Journey's End (1929), and Malvolio (Twelfth Night, 1930). Quartermaine appeared in several films during the 1920s and 1930s, including As You Like It (1936) in which he co-starred as Jacques to Laurence Olivier's Orlando. After the Second World War, Quartermaine joined the Royal Shakespeare Theatre for the 1949 and 1950 Stratford festivals, in a company including John Gielgud, Peggy Ashcroft, Anthony Quayle and other leading Shakespearean actors, in Macbeth, Measure for Measure and Much Ado About Nothing. In 1951 he played the part of the Inquisitor in a BBC television adaptation of Shaw's Saint Joan. Quartermaine died on 25 June 1967, in Salisbury, Wiltshire. His younger brother Charles Quartermaine (who adopted the surname spelling \"Quatermaine\") was also an actor."

  "text" : "Ludwig R. Conradi (or Louis R.

Born in Germany, as a young man he migrated to America. He was converted in 1878 to the Seventh-day Adventist faith. In 1879, he met Ellen G. White, attended the Battle Creek College, and then worked in Middle West for the German-speaking people. In 1882, he was ordained to the Ministry. In 1886, the General Conference of the Adventist Church sent him to work in Europe. He traveled widely throughout Germany, Switzerland, Russia, Turkey, Romania and Hungary. He was often pursued by the police. In 1889, he established the headquarters of the German Seventh-day Adventist Church in Hamburg. In 1901, he became the first chairman of the General European Conference, then later a president of the European Division and the vice-president of the General Conference. He remained head of the work in Europe until 1922. In 1909 and 1914, he traveled extensively in South America, where new conferences were being organized. He also made missionary journeys into Africa and the Middle and Far East. During the war he tried to have the church members support the German war effort and persecute those who resisted and caused a split in the Adventist church and the formation of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement who resisted his decisions. In 1932, he left the Adventist Church and became a member and minister at the Seventh Day Baptists. His written works include a revision and enlargement of J. N. Andrews' History of the Sabbath and his own expositions of the books of Daniel and the Revelation were translated into several languages."

He thrice sojourned in France while his ecclesiastical faction—the Pataria—was out of favour in Milan, and there learned under some of the leading philosophers of western Europe. After 1113, Landulf's primary ambition was to regain the priesthood in the church of San Paolo which he had lost, and to this end he communicated with popes and emperors. He played a role—large in his own account—in the election of Conrad of Hohenstaufen as King of Italy in 1128."

  "text" : "Landulf of Carcano (died 998) was the archbishop of Milan, as Landulf II, from 979 until his death. According to the 11th-century Milanese chronicler Landulf of Milan, Landulf came to power in Milan through \"the wicked designs of his father\", Bonizo, who had governed Milan during the time of Otto I, \"as a local count overseeing a castrum [castle]\". When the previous archbishop, Godfrey I, died on 19 September 979, Bonizo installed his son as bishop \"against the will of every order of cleric\". After Bonizo was murdered in bed by his slave, Landulf was forced to flee to the court of Otto II. Otto led an army \"of barbarians\", according to the chronicler, against Milan, but Landulf made an agreement with the leading men of the city and prevented bloodshed. The later capitanei of Milan, the \"nobles [vassals of the archbishop] whose estates lay in the countryside just outside the city\", claimed to derive their rights from this episode. Landulf is said to have invested them as \"greater knights\" (milites majores). According to the eleventh-century historian Arnulf of Milan, Landulf re-establish \"perpetual peace\" (pax perpetua) by enfeoffing the capitanei with ecclesiastical property. Landulf of Milan castigates the archbishop for being as \"wicked as a scorpion\" (iniquus velut scorpio) in alienating church lands. Landulf gave jobs to persons of the \"popular\" (i.e., lower) class, leading to tension with the civic leaders. In 983 Landulf was exiled from the city and had to make many concessions to the aristocracy to be allowed to return. In 996, Landulf founded the monastery of San Celso in Milan."

Durand chose a rather austere design, and was abruptly dismissed in June 1955.Couvrechef, who was known to prefer a more decorative style, was given responsibility for continuing the work. In 1857 Couvrechef became architect of the Château de Pau. Couvrechef was also involved in reconstruction of the Empress's Castillo de Arteaga in the province of Biscay in Spain, a medieval building surrounded by walls with four round towers. Couvrechef died in 1858 and was replaced as architect of the imperial residences by Gabriel-Auguste Ancelet."

  "text" : "Lewis Naphtali Dembitz (February 3, 1833 – March 11, 1907) was a German American legal scholar. His nephew Louis Brandeis, who admired him greatly, chose law as a profession because of Dembitz. Born into a Jewish family in Zirke, in the Prussian province of Posen, he attended gymnasium in Frankfurt, Sagan, and Glogau. After one semester at the Charles University in Prague studying law, he emigrated to the United States in 1849. He continued to train American law in offices at Cincinnati, Ohio, and Madison, Indiana. After doing journalistic work for a time, he began in 1853 the practise of law at the bar of Kentucky, in Louisville, which practise he has continued for the remainder of his career. Also politically active, Dembitz was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention, assistant city attorney of Louisville, 1884–1888, and was a commissioner for Kentucky to the Conference for the Uniformity of State Laws. In 1888, Dembitz drafted the first Australian ballot law ever adopted in the United States, to govern elections in Louisville. His legal works include: Kentucky Jurisprudence, 1890; Law Language for Shorthand Writers, 1892; and Land Titles in the United States, 2 vols., 1895. He is the author of \"The Question of Silver Coinage,\" in the Present Problem Series, 1896, No. 1; and has written a number of book-reviews for The Nation, 1888–97, besides articles in other magazines and in newspapers. Dembitz is strongly attached to conservative Judaism. He was one of the early members of the executive board of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, and in 1878 a member of the commission on the plan of study for the Hebrew Union College. In 1898 he acted as chairman at a convention of Orthodox congregations, and was elected a vice-president of the Orthodox Jewish Congregational Union of America. In addition to memoirs, articles, and addresses which have appeared in Jewish papers, he has published Jewish Services in Synagogue and Home, 1898; \"The Lost Tribes,\" in the Andover Review, Aug., 1889; and has revised Exodus and Leviticus for the new translation of the Bible to be issued by the Jewish Publication Society of America."

Worth's debut ended being the first in-depth account of punk history in Toronto in her debut Treat Me Like Dirt: An Oral History of Punk in Toronto and Beyond''. It was released when she was 27 years old. Worth's book was at the forefront of a renewed interest in preserving the history of Canadian punk, and has been cited as a trailblazing work that opened the doors for other books to be published about a previously under-documented portion of Canadian music history. Since the publication of Treat Me Like Dirt, Worth has shifted her focus from music journalism to poetry, fiction, and performance art. In 2011, her first full-length poetry collection Amphetamine Heart was published by Guernica Editions. Worth has said that this collection reflects the mental and emotional states she was in during the book's creation. \"I felt like I was collapsing in on myself,\" she told Proxart Magazine in 2011. Worth has also stated that Amphetamine Heart continues in the punk tradition of crossing genres between music and literature. Her next book, PostApoc, will be published by Now or Never Publishing in 2013. As a performance artist, Worth is performs solo and as one-half of Salt Circle, a Toronto-based duo that combines spoken word, noise, and ritual and performance elements."

  "text" : "Ludwig Ferdinand Schnorr von Carolsfeld (11 October 1788 – 13 April 1853) was a German Romantic painter, engraver and lithographer. Schnorr von Carolsfeld was born in Königsberg, the son and pupil of the artist Veit Hanns Schnorr von Carolsfeld. His younger brother was Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld and his nephew was the opera singer Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld. At the age of 16 he moved to Vienna, where he lived for the rest of his life. In 1804 he was registered as a student in the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna under Heinrich Friedrich Füger, who had become acquainted with his father in 1801. He became part of the group of Academy students round Friedrich Overbeck, who were looking for new paths beyond the strongly formal Classical ideals of the Academy. The outcome of their efforts was the Nazarene movement. Unlike Overbeck and others, however, Schnorr von Carolsfeld avoided a complete break with the Academy, did not join the Lukasbund (a group founded by the other Nazarene artists), and remained in Vienna. His first patron was Duke Albert von Sachsen-Teschen. Schnorr von Carolsfeld maintained close relations with the Catholic Romantics Zacharias Werner and Friedrich von Schlegel. In about 1808 he formed part of the circle of friends centred on Therese Malfatti and her family and drew portraits of Ludwig van Beethoven and his friend Ignaz von Gleichenstein. On 23 September 1812 in Vienna he married Karoline von Jankwitz, born in Silesia. In 1818 his bid to obtain the directorship of the Vienna Academy failed because of the opposition of Prince Metternich, the curator of the Academy, who mistrusted Schnorr von Carolsfeld because of his artistic and personal closeness to the artists of the Lukas group. He did however obtain a position from Archduke John of Austria, and provided the artworks for Brandhof, the Archduke's refurbished country house, up to 1828. In 1821 he became the teacher of Moritz von Schwind. In the same year he converted to Roman Catholicism. Schnorr von Carolsfeld undertook study trips to Southern Germany, Switzerland and Paris (1834), and to Northern Germany (1837). Thanks to the Archduke he came into contact with the Austro-Hungarian Imperial family, who gave him commissions. In 1835, thanks again to the Archduke, and also thanks to the fact that Romantic painting was beginning to become popular throughout Germany, he became after all a member of the Academy in Vienna. From 1841 he was the curator of the Imperial gallery in the Belvedere Palace. He died in Vienna in 1853. In 1937 the \"Schnorrgasse\", a street in Floridsdorf in the 21st district of Vienna, was named in honour of him and his brother Julius."

Palgyi Dorje was Padmasambhava's student. In Tibetan tradition, King Langdarma persecuted Buddhism in Tibet. To end this persecution, Pelgyi Dorje traveled to the King's palace where he surprised the King and killed him with a bow and arrow. Pelgyi Dorje then fled to Amdo (Qinghai) or Yerpa, where he lived out the rest of his life as a recluse. Regarded as maybe historical fact, the assassination story is widely held in sources."

  "text" : "Luigi Castellacci (1797 in Pisa – 1845) was an Italian virtuoso on the mandolin and guitar, an instrumental composer and the author of popular French romances with guitar and piano accompaniments. He was the son of musical parents and as soon as he was capable of holding a mandolin, his father placed one in his hands and gave him instruction on the instrument and in the theory of music. Castellacci's progress was rapid; he performed frequently as a musical prodigy in his native city. Having thoroughly studied the mandolin for some years, he extended the sphere of his concert performances with the instrument throughout northern Italy. He then turned his attention to the guitar, devoting several years to this instrument. He taught both instruments. About the year 1820 he left his native Pisa to tour as a professional mandolin and guitar virtuoso. He was drawn to Paris (as had Ferdinando Carulli and Matteo Carcassi). He made a name there in the musical world, particularly by his performances on the guitar and his vocal compositions with guitar accompaniment. He was well established by 1825 and appeared as guitarist in the most influential musical circles, being esteemed and recognized as a musician of the first rank. During his residence in Paris, he issued his first compositions; he published several compositions in other important French cities as well, where he appeared as guitar soloist. In 1825 he commenced a tour through Germany, and passing through this country and Switzerland he visited his native land. His talent was appreciated during this tour, and upon his arrival in Milan he gave several concerts, and also in his native city, Pisa. During a brief stay there, he published several compositions for the mandolin, and then returned to Paris, where he was busily engaged as a teacher of his instruments. In 1834 he visited London and revisited it during the season of the following year, and there, too, he published compositions for the guitar. Castellacci then returned to Paris, where he lived for many years and published more than two hundred compositions, principally for the guitar and mandolin, and romances with guitar accompaniment."

  "text" : "American actor and producer Bradley Cooper has received several awards and nominations for his film and theatrical performances. His major nominations include four Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, seven MTV Movie Awards, one Producers Guild Award, three Satellite Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and one Tony Award. While Cooper's film career began in 2001 with the cult film Wet Hot American Summer, his breakthrough performance came in the 2009 comedy The Hangover. Cooper was nominated for an MTV Movie Award and a Satellite Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture. However, Cooper also won a Golden Raspberry Award that same year for his performance in All About Steve. The next two years saw Cooper receive nominations for his performances in various action and comedy films like The A-Team (2010), Limitless, and The Hangover Part II (both in 2011). Cooper began 2012 with a Teen Choice Award nomination for The Words, before playing the role of Pat Solitano in the critically acclaimed romantic comedy-drama Silver Linings Playbook. The film garnered numerous accolades, with Cooper winning an MTV Movie Award, while receiving nominations for an Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor. The following year, Cooper played the supporting role of Richie DiMaso, in the crime-comedy American Hustle. The film was a critical success, and garnered several accolades. Cooper was nominated for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Critics' Choice Movie Award, and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, but did not win any. In 2014, Cooper received two nominations for his role as Rocket in the superhero film Guardians of the Galaxy. Later that year, he starred in and co-produced the biographical war film American Sniper. Cooper was nominated for an Academy Award and MTV Movie Award for Best Actor, and an Academy Award for Best Picture. With these nominations, Cooper became only the tenth actor in history to receive an Academy Award nomination in three consecutive years. Although Cooper's roles in the 2015 films Aloha and Joy earned him two additional nominations, his performance as the severely deformed Joseph Merrick in the Broadway revival The Elephant Man garnered more recognition.

  "text" : "Lynn R. Webster, MD, (born November 10, 1950) is a pain researcher and physician. From 1990 to 2010, he headed Lifetree Pain Clinic with approximately 15 healthcare providers. In 2010, Dr. Webster left the pain clinic to focus full-time on clinical research. The Lifetree Pain Clinic closed. Omega Pain Clinic is now on the site headed by another physician. Dr. Webster is a past President of the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM). His research work centers on the development of safer and more effective therapies for chronic pain and addiction prevention. He has studied the effects of opioids on sleep, the testing of new opioid formulations designed to deter misuse and effective screening methods to prevent opioid misuse. He is best known for developing the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) and for his public campaign to reduce overdose deaths from prescription medications. Webster is currently the Vice President of Scientific Affairs at PRA Health Sciences. In 2013, it was revealed that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) had opened an investigation related to overdose deaths at the Lifetree Pain Clinic, beginning in 2010. After the investigation had concluded, in June 2016, the Salt Lake City Tribune was able to report that the U.S. attorney in Utah had declined to prosecute the case. In September 2015, Dr. Webster published The Painful Truth: What Chronic Pain Is Really Like and Why It Matters to Each of Us, an intimate collection of stories about people living with disabling pain, their attempts to heal, and the challenges that society collectively faces in helping them live meaningful lives. In 2016, he will release an accompanying documentary to the book, to be released on a major television network."

  "text" : "Leonard Knyff or Leendert Knijff (10 August 1650, Haarlem - April 1722, London) was a Dutch draughtsman and painter. He was the son of landscape painter Wouter Knijff and the brother of Jacob Knijff and left around 1681 from Holland to England. Knyff collaborated with Kip to produce views of country houses and gardens for Britannia Illustrata and Le Nouveau Théâtre. The topographical images of Kip and Knyff are significant for providing reliable illustrations of the development of the formal English garden in the Dutch-French style. Their documentary information for this period in British architecture and landscape design is particularly valued because, within a generation, the formal gardens seen in these views would be swept away in favor of the pastoral compositions, derived from idealized landscapes of painters such as Claude Lorrain, that characterize the \"naturalistic\" English landscape gardens. In the later 20th century many of the Kip and Knyff views were hand-coloured, as monochrome landscapes proved increasingly harder to sell in the market."

Born in 1937 in Tashkent, Lev's father Waldemar reportedly was of German familial origin rumored of Nußberg gardeners, but the Von Nusbergs appear to at some point in history lost the aristocratic prefix \"von\". Waldemar, an architect, in 1938 was accused of \"spying for a foreign power\" and, following a quick Soviet era conviction, disappeared while incarcerated as a prisoner of a gulag in Urals. Lev's mother, born Raisa Bespalova, was a Russian singer. In the late 1940s, Nussberg moved to Leningrad. Nussberg graduated from the Moscow Art School 1905 (MSKhSh, 1951–58). Nussberg is best known for being the founder and leader of the influential Dvizheniye Group (1962–78) whose members included Francisco Infante-Arana and Viacheslav Koleichuk. The aim of the Dvizheniye (Russian for \"movement\") collective was to create and develop in the 'bio-centric' movement the group essentially pioneered, called Игровые Бионик-кинетических Системы [playful bionic-kinetic systems]. He also founded the group Dynamik in Leningrad. Nussberg emigrated to Germany in 1976. He held a number of exhibitions, in Düsseldorf and Paris (1976), Venice, Netherlands and London (1977), Bochum, Turin, Kassel, New York (1978), and in Bochum (1979). In 1980 he moved to the United States."

  "text" : "Laurence T. Maloney is an American psychology professor who applies mathematical models in order to enhance understanding of human behavior. A professor in New York University’s Department of Psychology and Center for Neural Science, Maloney has conducted studies in the physics and mathematics of color vision that resulted in two highly cited articles in the Journal of the Optical Society of America. Previously, his work in visual-cue combination led to a frequently cited review article in Vision Research. Recently, his studies on movement planning and decision making under risk has built a bridge between two previously unrelated fields, serving as an important contribution to the newly emerging field of neuroeconomics. Maloney and his colleagues are currently studying color perception and surface material perception in complex, three-dimensional scenes, human performance in perceptual and movement tasks equivalent to economic games, and face perception. In recognition of his scholarship, Maloney has received several awards and honors. These include: the Humboldt Research Award from Germany’s Humboldt Foundation; the Troland Award of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the highest honors possible for a psychologist in the United States, which he shared with Brian Wandell; and a one-year research fellowship, given by the German Research Council, at Bielefeld University’s Center for Interdisciplinary Studies as part of a group considering perception and evolution. In 1998, Maloney was named Forchheimer Visiting Professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem and in 2009 WICN Scholar at Bangor University, Wales. He has also been selected as a fellow of the Society of Experimental Psychologists, the Association for Psychological Science, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Maloney was previously an assistant professor at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in Psychology and in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (1985-1988). He has been a visiting professor at several academic institutions, including the universities of Freiburg, Giessen, Paris, and Padova. Maloney has a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Yale University (1973), a masters degree in mathematical statistics from Stanford University (1982), and a doctorate in psychology from Stanford (1985)."

  "text" : "Lulu Glaser (June 2, 1874 - September 5, 1958) was a popular American actress and vocalist. She appeared on Broadway and later Vaudeville. Glaser's first appearance on the stage was at the Broadway Theatre in New York on December 30, 1891 in the play The Lion Tamer. She appeared in two more plays and on October 3, 1893 appeared as Javotte in a revival of Erminie starring Francis Wilson. Glaser appeared in only two motion pictures, both silent films. Love's Pilgrimage to America (1916) and How Molly Made Good (1915). The latter still survives and is available on DVD. Glaser appears as herself, in a cameo along with other celebrities of the time. She was married twice. Both marriages ended in divorce. She married actor Ralph C. Herz in 1907, but they divorced in 1912. Herz died in 1921. Her later marriage to Thomas D. Richards also ended in divorce. Lulu Glaser is often erroneously said to have been one of the many wives of De Wolf Hopper, but this is not true. Hopper's fifth and last wife was named 'Lillian Glaser' and is not related to Lulu Glaser. Lulu, a singer like De Wolf, may have appeared with him on the stage at some point in their long careers. Glaser died at Weston, Connecticut September 5, 1958."

Reclusive by nature, a character trait that became more exaggerated in the 1940s and later, Kelly’s work reflects his determination not to be limited by the trends of his time. His large output of paintings is complemented by a prolific number of drawings that span his career of 50 years. Some of the collections where his work is represented are: The Metropolitan Museum in New York, The Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and Boston Public Library."

She also worked extensively on Broadway, was a long-time writing partner of Mel Tolkin, and published six novels, including a series of mysteries featuring the character C.B. Greenfield. The Mystery Fancier discussed and reviewed her books, and one was quoted in English Historical Syntax and Morphology. Sid Caesar's writer's room has been fictionally recreated many times. Neil Simon, one of the writers, memorialized it in his play Laughter on the 23rd Floor; it formed the centerpiece of the 1982 film My Favorite Year, and most famously, it was the office in which Rob Petrie worked in The Dick Van Dyke Show. Kallen and Selma Diamond were the only woman writers on Sid Caesar's follow-up show, Caesar's Hour."

  "text" : "Lawrence (Hungarian: Lőrinc; died 1265 or 1266) was a Hungarian distinguished nobleman and military leader, who served as voivode of Transylvania between 1242 and 1252. His origin is uncertain; Tudor Sălăgean assigned him to the kindred Aba, however, according to Pál Engel, he belonged to the Illyéd branch of the gens Kán. He had a son from his unidentified wife, Lawrence II, who served as master of the cupbearers (1272–1273; 1274) and ban of Severin (1279; 1291). Lawrence was first mentioned by contemporary records in the first regnal year (1235) of Béla IV of Hungary, when he functioned as ispán (comes) of Fejér County. In 1238, a charter in a connection with donation from Andrew II of Hungary, referred to him as \"former\" (tunc temporis) ispán, which implies Lawrence maybe already held that office during the end of Andrew's reign. He served as ispán of Bihar County between 1236 and 1238. He was appointed master of the cupbearers and ispán for the stablemen (Hungarian: lovászispán; Latin: comes agasonum) in 1240. After the Mongol invasion (1241–1242), where voivode Pousa, son of Sólyom died, the consolidation of the province of Transylvania was the main task of Lawrence, who was appointed voivode by Béla IV and held the office for 10 years from 1242. He also fought in the royal army in a war against Austria in 1246 and participated in the battle of the Leitha River, where Frederick the Quarrelsome killed. Besides his voivodeship, Lawrence also functioned as ispán of Valkó County from 1248 to 1252. During the throne fights in the 1260s, he supported junior king Stephen, who rebelled against his father's rule and governed Transylvania independently from Béla IV, holding the title of duke of Transylvania. Consequently, Lawrence served as master of the treasury for Stephen between 1263 and 1265. He was appointed ban of Severin (Hungarian: Szörény) in 1263, where Stephen also exercised the royal rights."

It premiered at Teatro del Circo on 25 November 1858 with great acclaim."

  "text" : "Luis de Olona y Gaeta (Málaga, 1823 – Barcelona, 1863) was a playwright, theater impresario and librettist of a number of Spanish zarzuelas by the mid of 19th-century Spain. He was a very prolific playwright, writing comedies, farces and operettas, arranged by famous composers of the zarzuela genre. His theatrical approach is said to be very weak in construction and plentiful in improbabilities, so much that it was largely criticized by Narciso Díaz de Escovar and Francisco Javier Lasso de la Vega. Luis de Olona, brother to José de Olona, lived a bohemian life in his native Málaga before settling in Madrid, where he directed small theaters and worked in the press. He also collaborated with artists such as Mariano Pina y Bohigas, Valladares Garriga and Antonio García Gutiérrez. Among some of his titles are the comedy El primo y el relicario (1843), the drama  El caudillo de Zamora (1847), and the comic-drama Las dos carteras (1851). Other works which are worth mentioning are his zarzuelas Galanteos en Venecia (1853), El sargento Federico (1855), El postillón de La Rioja (1856) by Cristóbal Oudrid, with whom he worked from 1851-1856, Casado y soltero (1858), Los circasianos (1860), and Joaquín Gaztambide's El juramento (1863)."

  "text" : "Luis Cruz Azaceta (born April 5, 1942) is a Cuban American painter. Since the late 1970s the paintings and drawings of Luis Cruz Azaceta have been taking the moral and ethical pulse of this country. In usually large-format works, executed with highly expressive colors, Cruz Azaceta has dealt with themes of urban violence, the type of personal isolation that comes with living in a large and overcrowded city, the hellish conditions created by mismanaged government, the abuses and oppression of dictatorships and, in a number of highly affecting works done back in the late 1980s, the ravages of AIDS. Azaceta is a true maverick...his art does not look much like anyone else’s...He is a devotee of visual experiment who often develops parallel series in several media at once, and he has a tendency to combine materials in totally unexpected ways, as with his extended series of photographs mounted on twisted metal stud. Last but not least, Azaceta works constantly, is extremely prolific...Day after day, Azaceta, like most of us but differently, uses all his effort figuring out how to move forward, while never permitting himself to lose sight of what’s been left behind. For him, art is not a vehicle by which one achieves aesthetic satisfaction and an escape from common history and time. Rather, it is a way of facing the world. Azaceta recognizes that change is inevitable, and that all of us are implicated by reality and time passing. The world we inhabit is contingent and changing; and chaos is an inherent part of the process. This is the reality we all share and which we all too often ignore."

He was the son of a judge whose peripatetic career took him to different corners of Spain during his childhood. In 1915 the family settled in Madrid, where Vivanco spent the majority of his life. He studied architecture at university, where he also composed poetry. His friendship with Rafael Alberti and Xavier Zubiri also dates from this period. He finished his architecture course in 1932. His acquaintances also included Luis Rosales and Pablo Neruda. He spent a long time recovering from illness in the Sierra de Guadarrama. He published his first works in the journal Cruz y Raya run by his uncle José Bergamín. At the same time, he was also working as an architect with another uncle Rafael Bergamín. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, he decided in favour of General Franco and wrote propaganda poetry. He wrote in the journal Escorial with Luis Rosales, Leopoldo Panero, etc. They were all considered part of the Generation of '36. In Escorial, he wrote poetry described as intimate, realist and meditative. Also in his work, nature acquires a transcendental quality akin to religious experience. Among his other themes are the family and daily life."

He came from an assimilated Jewish family. He lost his father when he was little. After graduation from high school in 1937 he became a counsellor at HaNoar HaTzioni youth organisation. During the war he joined the Zionist Bnei Akiva youth movement. He lived together with his mother Maria (Miriam) Rotblat at 44 Muranowska Street in Warsaw. In March 1943 Arie Wilner found refuge in their flat. When deportation to Treblinka extermination camp took place in the summer of 1942 he and his mother, director of an orphanage at 18 Mylna Street, hid a group of Jewish children in one of the houses in the ghetto. On February 22, 1943 he participated in elimination of a Gestapo agent, Alfred Nossig. Between January and April 1943 he took part in actions of collecting weapons for ŻOB. He was also engaged in production of weapons in the ghetto (hand grenades, bottles with petrol). On the eve of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in April 1943 he was appointed a commander of his group formed of Bnei Akiva members. The group fought in the so-called central ghetto area. On May 8, 1943 he was with his mother in the bunker at 18 Mila Street. When the bunker was discovered by the Germans the fighters didn’t want to surrender. At command of Arie Wilner the majority of fighters committed suicide. Lutek shot his mother first, at her own request, and later took his own life. He is buried in a mass grave along with other deceased ŻOB fighters in the spot where they perished, because no exhumation was ever conducted at 18 Mila Street."

Many of his books have civil rights themes; his book We Are One: The Story of Bayard Rustin won the Jane Addams Children's Book Award, in the \"older children\" category, in 2008. This was followed by Birmingham Sunday, which received the Orbis Pictus Honor Book Award in 2011 from the National Council for Teachers of English and the Eureka! Gold Award from the California Reading Association. His 2011 title, Black & White: The Confrontation between Reverend Fred L. Shuttlesworth and Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, was given the Carter G. Woodson Book Award (The National Council for the Social Studies) and named a Robert F. Sibert Honor Book (The Association for Library Service to Children/American Librarian Association). More recently, Brimner has turned to the migrant children he once taught with the publication of STRIKE! The Farm Workers' Fight for Their Rights (Calkins Creek Books), which received a starred review in Kirkus Reviews."

While working full-time as a reporter, she attended Pasco-Hernando State College and received her associate degree. In 1985, she and Jack Reed shared the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for their coverage of corruption in the Pasco County Sheriff's Office; she was the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize in that category. In another case, in 1973, she was convicted of contempt for refusing to disclose a confidential source; the Florida Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1976. In 1982 she was a Pulitzer finalist for her investigation of drug trafficking in north central Florida counties. She became Capital Bureau chief in Tallahassee in 1986 and later worked on special projects and as a columnist. A 2012 All Things Considered profile described Morgan as \"an institution in Florida\". Seven years after her first announced retirement led to a continued active reporting career, she announced her full retirement in January 2013. Morgan was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame in 2006. In 2005 the Florida State Senate renamed its press gallery in her honor. Morgan's investigation of the $49.6 million mortgage fraud/Ponzi scheme run in Glenville, North Carolina, to where she had retired, by Miami developer Domenico Rabuffo - while he was in the United States Federal Witness Protection Program  - was the subject of the American Greed episode \"Goodfella Gone Bad\"."

  "text" : "Leonardo Patterson (born c. 1942) is a colourful and controversial antiquities dealer who specialises in Pre-Columbian artefacts. He was born to Jamaican parents and was raised in Cahuita, Costa Rica. Patterson started work as an apprentice jeweller, moving on to work as an antiquities middle-man as he gained exposure to a wider range of objects, and graduating to the role of international dealer and collector. Patterson began to deal on a large scale in New York in the 1960s and 1970s when restrictions on the trade in antiquities were loose. In the 1970s, restrictions were tightened on the export of archaeological artefacts as more countries took an interest in what was happening to their cultural heritage and in 1983 the United States signed a UNESCO convention on the illegal export of cultural property. In 1984 Patterson was charged by the FBI with attempting to sell a fake Maya fresco to an art dealer and Patterson was sentenced to probation. In 1985 he was convicted of importing the eggs of endangered sea turtles into the United States. In 1995 he was appointed a cultural attaché to the United Nations, before questions about his past caused him to resign and he began to spend more time in Europe, particularly in Germany. A number of legal cases have followed including the return of items to Mexico and Peru, notably a gold Moche headdress in the form of an octopus recovered with the help of Michel van Rijn."

  "text" : "Lonnie Dupre (born 17 April 1961) is a contemporary Arctic explorer whose achievements include the first Pacific to Atlantic winter traversal of the Northwest Passage by dog sled in 1991 and the first human-powered circumnavigation of Greenland, by sled and kayak, in 2001. In 2006, he also successfully executed the first human-powered summer expedition to the North Pole by sled and canoe, and would later return to the pole as part of the unsupported human-powered 2009 Peary-Henson Centennial Expedition. In January, 2015, Dupre completed a solo climb of Mt. McKinley after three previous attempts. Sixteen people had previously reached McKinley's summit in winter, although six died on descent and none made the climb during January. In 2004, Dupre was honoured with the Rolex Award for Enterprise for bringing attention to the impacts of climate change on the Arctic through his expeditions, among other Northern issues."

  "text" : "Luigi Lucchini (21 January 1919 – 26 August 2013) was an Italian businessman and steel executive. The son of an iron craftsman, Lucchini was born in Casto, Brescia, Italy on 21 January 1919. He graduated in foreign languages at the Catholic University of Milan and after a brief period working as a teacher he took over his father's workshop in Val Sabbia. After World War II he realized his first extensions of the family business, installing a small mill for the production of rebar. Between the 1970s and the 1980s, the company had its true season of expansion, with the acquisition of several production facilities in and outside Italy. In 1975 he was appointed Cavaliere del Lavoro, and in later years he entered the Board of Directors of the Banca Commerciale Italiana (of which he became chairman), Montedison (chairman), Compart (chairman), Assicurazioni Generali (of which he became a member of the Executive Committee), Olivetti, Mediobanca and Gemina. From 1978 to 1983 Lucchini was president of the Industrial Association of Brescia and a member of the board of Confindustria, of which he became the president in 1984. From 1980 to 1982 Lucchini was also part of the EEC Consultative Committee in representation of the European private steel producers. After the sale of the majority stake of the company to Severstal in 2005, Lucchini remained honorary president of the group until 2010, when he announced his retirement."

  "text" : "Lucy Gwynne Branham (1892 in Kempsville, Virginia - 1966) was an American suffragist associated with the National Women's Party. She earned degrees in history from Washington College in Maryland, and Johns Hopkins University (Masters' degree). While teaching in Florida, she received a Carnegie Medal for saving Dema T. Nelson from drowning in the ocean in 1915. She began work on a Ph.D. at Columbia University under Charles A. Beard, but, in the words of historian Julia L. Mickenberg, Branham \"turned from academia to activism, becoming a field organizer for the NWP.\" Historian Katherine A. S. Siegel notes that, \"In 1916, Branham put her studies aside to begin work in the National Woman's Party.\" Siegel writes that Branham \"worked tirelessly for suffrage and, when she could, on the readings Beard assigned her,\" and she began teaching history in Columbia's adult extension program in the fall of 1920, but she left within a year to go to Russia as a representative of the New York Herald - Armand Hammer described her as the \"suffragette history professor.\" Although the dissertation she was working on (\"The History of Labor and Politics in New York\") was listed as being \"in progress\" with an expected completion date of 1922, Columbia University \"has no record that Branham ever finished her Ph.D.\" Her Johns Hopkins master's thesis (\"An Outline of the Political History of Georgia, During the Revolutionary War\") is the only thesis or dissertation listed under her name in WorldCat, so Branham must have been ABD and never finished her doctorate, concentrating on activism rather than academe. In 1916 she was a National Women's Party organizer in Utah, and in September of the following year she was arrested for picketing the White House as part of the Silent Sentinels, a NWP campaign for women's suffrage, for which she served two months in the Occoquan Workhouse and the District jail. In 1918 Branham lobbied in Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama for a federal amendment in the Senate that would legalize women's suffrage. She traveled around America speaking of her experiences in prison as part of the NWP's “Prison Special” tour of 1919. Also in 1919, Branham burned a letter from President Woodrow Wilson in Lafayette Square to protest for women's suffrage. After women's suffrage was obtained, she led the Inez Milholland Memorial Fund Committee, which created an ongoing endowment fund for the NWP. Branham worked for Russian relief with the American Women's Emergency Committee, and lobbied Congress against the Allied blockade of Russia; worked with the American Friends Service Committee; served as field secretary for Russian Reconstruction Farms; headed the Women's Committee for the Recognition of Russia, which was under the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom; and was executive secretary of the American Society for Cultural Relations with Russia. She also worked with the World Woman's Party in Geneva and lobbied the League of Nations on equal rights issues. In the late 1950s she lived at Sewall-Belmont House and served on the NWP's Congressional Committee to lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment. Branham's mother, Lucy Fisher Gwynne Branham, was also a suffragist, and was arrested for her part in the watch fire demonstrations in January 1919 and served three days in the District jail."

  "text" : "Ludwig Pollak (14 September 1868, Prague – 1943, Auschwitz concentration camp) was an Austro-Czech classical archaeologist, antiquities dealer, and director of the Museo Barracco di Scultura Antica in Rome. He is perhaps best known for discovering in 1906 the missing right arm of Laocoön in the famous ancient Roman sculpture Laocoön and His Sons. The rest of the statue had been discovered in 1506, with the arm as well as several other pieces, including the arms of the sons and parts of the snake, missing. The Renaissance sculptor Michelangelo had correctly suggested that the missing right arms were originally bent back over the shoulder; however, most others disagreed, opting for a reconstructed arm in an heroic extended fashion. This incorrectly reconstructed arm was added to the statue. In 1906, Pollak discovered a fragment of a marble arm in a builder‘s yard in Rome, close to the findspot of the rest of the statue. Noting a stylistic similarity to the Laocoön group he presented it to the Vatican Museums: it remained in their storerooms for half a century. In 1957 (after Pollak's death) the museum decided that this arm—bent, as Michelangelo had suggested—had originally belonged to this Laocoön, and replaced it. According to Paolo Liverani: \"Remarkably, despite the lack of a critical section, the join between the torso and the arm was guaranteed by a drill hole on one piece which aligned perfectly with a corresponding hole on the other\"."

After returning to Italy his life continued to be difficult, and he suffered from mental health problems. Although he married and had four children the marriage did not last. He died alone in a public hospital."

After his return to Sweden, Alsheimer worked as an education consultant and freelance journalist for Svenska Dagbladet and Hufvudstadsbladet. Alsheimer became a well-known figure in Swedish media after having introduced liberal arts in the law school curriculums. With his \"core curriculum\" he demanded that his students engaged in literature relevant not only to law, but to subjects such as history, politics and ethics. \"High school students entering universities suffer from academic bulimia; binge eat, throw up and move on\", says Leif Alsheimer, professor in Jurisprudence. In 2002, Alsheimer won Nationalencyklopedins Kunskapspris, one of the most prestigious awards in academia.Alsheimer was married to Elisabeth Alsheimer Evenstedt, with whom he had three children; Sebastian, Louise and Sophie."

  "text" : "Livia Rothkirchen (1922-2013), historian, author and archivist, made distinct contribution to documenting the Holocaust, specifically issues flowing from Nazi Germany’s peacetime take-over of the democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia. Nearly two years before the outbreak of World War II, Germany seized the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia with the assent of major European states. Germany then dismembered Czechoslovakia, replacing it with German-controlled Bohemia and Moravia, and a nominally independent Slovak state, which collaborated with Nazi policy. In all three areas, harsh regulations were imposed on Jewish citizens, most of whom were ultimately deported and killed. Rothkirchen examines the impact of decisions of Europe's political leaders on general society, on Jewish communal leaders attempting to save their communities, and on Jewish individuals attempting to save themselves and their families from annihilation. A native of Sevlusa, in the Carpathia region of Slovakia, Livia Rothkirchen was born on 2 November 1922. She had harsh personal experience of the Holocaust, having survived imprisonment at the Auschwitz extermination camp. After Liberation, she earned a PhD. from the Charles University in Prague, immigrated to Israel, and joined the staff of Yad Vashem, Israel’s official memorial to victims of the Holocaust. Rothkirchen authored the volumes, The Jews of Bohemia and Moravia: Facing the Holocaust, and,. The latter was the first authoritative description of the deportation and murder of the Jews of Slovakia. Rothkirchen is editor of volume 9 of Yad Vashem Studies on the European Jewish Catastrophe and Resistance  and she authored and co-authored numerous articles. She was awarded the Max Nordau Prize for history.She died in Jerusalem, in 2013 An issue of YadVashem Studies was dedicated to her memory."

  "text" : "Lorenzo (Renzo) Tomatis (Sassoferrato, Italy, 2 January 1929 - Lyon, France, 21 September 2007) was an Italian physician and experimental oncologist. He is best remembered as the Director from 1982 until 1993 of the prestigious International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon - (IARC), which evaluates and provides guidelines on the effects of chemical or physical carcinogens. During his tenure at IARC, Tomatis led the effort to create the IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risk to Humans (the so-called “orange books”), a critical tool for the primary prevention of cancer, and IARC's most famous product. With over 350 publications and 10 books, since the 1950s Tomatis was ahead of his time—developing carcinogenesis bioassays which recognized trans-placental and trans-generational carcinogenesis, thus highlighting the vulnerabilities of early-life exposure. Tomatis was a leader in the difficult task of translating animal experimental findings to human risk (reflected in the IARC monographs, which assess animal, molecular biology and human evidence on an agent). He used these many qualifications get enacted strategies for the primary prevention of cancer—that is, reduced exposure to carcinogens. In addition Tomatis was committed to the sociology of science, especially the causes of the 'brain drain' from ' Italy. In summary, 'Renzo' Tomatis was one of the world's most distinguished experts on carcinogenesis and its primary prevention."

  "text" : "Lawrence Christian Biedenharn, Jr. (18 November 1922, Vicksburg, Mississippi – 12 February 1996, Austin, Texas) was an American theoretical nuclear physicist and mathematical physicist, a leading expert on applications of Lie group theory to physics. Biedenharn studied at MIT with an interruption in WWII from 1942 to 1946 as a lieutenant in the Signal Corps in the Pacific theater, where in 1946 he was stationed in Tokyo for a year as a radio officer. He received his bachelor's degree in absentia from MIT. After WWII, he returned to MIT where he received his PhD in physics under Victor Weisskopf in 1950. As an MIT graduate student he shared an office with J. David Jackson, then a graduate student, and John Blatt, then a post-doc. Biedenharn was employed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, became an assistant professor at Yale University, and then an associate professor at Rice University. From 1961 he was a professor at Duke University, where he became in 1987 \"James B. Duke Professor\", and then retired in 1992 as professor emeritus. He remained active in teaching and research as an adjunct professor at the University of Texas, Austin. In 1996 he died from kidney cancer. Biedenharn is known for his contributions to the quantum theory of angular momentum, especially the theory of nuclear reactions and Coulomb excitations (excitations of atoms by the scattering of charged particles and the Coulomb interaction with the nucleus). In the later part of his career, he worked on representation of quantum groups. From 1985 to 1993 he was the chief editor of the Journal of Mathematical Physics. For many years Hendrik van Dam was his co-editor. In 1958 Biedenharn was a Fulbright Fellow and a Guggenheim Fellow. He received the Jesse W. Beams Award in 1979 and twice received (1976 and 1987) the Humboldt Prize. In 1950 he married Sarah Willingham, who became a lawyer; they had a son and a daughter."

She was the daughter of Giovanni Alvise Marcello and married Mocenigo in 1533. Together with her sisters Bianca, Daria and Maria, she was referred to as fiore de'l secolo and regarded to represent the ideal of the educated renaissance woman for the nobility in Venice. She was regarded a scholar, described as attractive and educated and was the author of letters and poetry. She also studied botany. She studied under a professor of the Biological Garden in Padua, Melchiorre Giuliandino. She was known for the formulas and recipes she developed for use against plagues. Presumably these were palliatives rather than cures. Her work is lost, but her botanical research it is noted to have been consulted and put to good use during the epidemic which appeared in Venice few years after her death (1575). Ottavio Maggio wrote poems about her death."

In attempt to please all film goers, he created an uncanny mixture of monsters and horror with action, sex, science fiction, and comedy. To save money, he often wrote the screenplay as well as producing the films from his Filmica Vergara Cinecomisiones, a film production company he founded in 1952. During the two decades that Vergara wrote and produced films he worked with many actors and actress that included, Susana Dosamantes, Macaria, Altia Michel, Isela Vega, John Carradine, and Boris Karloff.He produced the last four films in which Boris Karloff appeared: The Snake People, The Incredible Invasion, Fear Chamber, and House of Evil. Bill Warren, the science-fiction historian, was on the set during the filming; he reported that Vergara forced the director of the American sequences Jack Hill to tie down with a rope “an early portable video camera to the top of the 35mm Mitchell he was using as his principal camera.” Vergara knew a visionary idea when he saw one because “video assist” is currently a standard in film making. Due to his unexpected death, the release of the Karloff films was held up due to ownership rights of inheritance under Mexican law."

He died at Bad Harzburg while on a collection excursion in the Harz Mountains. The moss genera Loeskeobryum (M.Fleisch. ex Broth. 1925) and Loeskypnum (H.K.G.Paul, 1916) are named in his honor."

He returned to France in 1847. He returned to Egypt in 1867 and died 1 April of that year. Scholars have questioned the authenticity of his writing and stories, including Heinrich Kiepert. His visits to the Zande people were later discovered as being false. His work is held in the collection of the Library of Congress."

Upon her death it was said of her: \"She was a watchtower of feminism in America. Of advanced ideas, of noble and delicate features, of exquisite culture, of innate goodness and of a warm heart.” Lastenia Larriva outlived her husband, the Ecuadorian poet Numa Pompilio Llona (1832-1907), who was one of the most popular and well-read poets in Ecuador in his time."

  "text" : "Lotte Brand Philip (May 27, 1910 – May 2, 1986) was a German art historian, professor and expert on Netherlandish art, one of the most notable and incisive experts on 14th- and 15th-century art to have studied under Erwin Panofsky. Born a Christian of Jewish descent, she resisted state intimidation to leave Germany, only moving to the United States in 1941. She began her new life as a jewelry designer, before establishing a career as an art historian and writer, and taking professorship at a number of universities, including New York University and Queens College, Flushing. During her long career, Brand wrote highly regarded books and monographs on artists such as Jan van Eyck, Albrecht Dürer and Hieronymus Bosch, and in 1980 became emeritus at Queens. Brand Philip died on May 2, 1986 in New York City."

  "text" : "Lisa Cartwright is a scholar, author, professor and critic best known for helping to found the field of visual culture studies and for coauthoring Practices of Looking, a widely translated visual studies textbook with Marita Sturken that is regarded as one of the first comprehensive books in the field after John Berger's Ways of Seeing. In Practices of Looking, Cartwright and Sturken examine the complexity of the relationship between viewers and objects in a variety of visual media ranging from film and photography to advertising, painting, and printmaking. They pay especially close attention to the historical, social, and psychological conditions that help to constitute 'seeing' at any given moment. Cartwright is also known for her work in feminist visual science and technology studies and disability studies. In her 1995 book Screening the Body, for example, she shows how technological and scientific developments in medical imaging converge with the popular and social imagination to \"make the body visible in new ways\". Here, among other things, she addresses how documentary imagery is produced and used for moralizing or spectacular ends, moves that undercut its supposedly scientific neutrality, and how 'seeing' through medical optical instruments continues a displacement of direct sensory engagement that has been ramping up since the Renaissance. Elsewhere, her essay on the Visible Human Project in The Visible Woman is cited as one that laid much of the groundwork for a critical examination of this large undertaking to create a complete set of cross-sectional photographs of the human body. Cartwright is a professor in the departments of Visual Arts, Communication and Science Studies at the University of California, San Diego. She was a founding member of the Program in Visual and Cultural Studies at the University of Rochester, where she taught from 1990 to 2002."

  "text" : "Luigi Tosti (Piacenza, 1845 - ) was an Italian sculptor. He first studied in the studio of a sculptor named Gregori, then he enrolled to study design at the Istituto Gazzola, under the direction of Giuseppe Giorgi (also called Pietrogiorgi) to become a designer of ornamentation. After learning disegno, also showed skill in figure painting, and he apprenticed with professor Lorenzo Toncini, who recommended him to try his had at sculpting. Using a stipend from the Gazzola Institute, he came to Florence, where at the first year of his studies, he exhibited two busts: one of a woman peasant, the other a portrait of Melchiorre Gioia; afterwards he completed a full-size statue of Torquato Tasso, and designs a monument to painter Gaspare Landi. But to have the Istituto Gazzola continue his pension, he sent a San Sebastiano back, in a life-size bas-relief. At the Mostra of Florence, he exhibited: Le Vergognosa, which was awarded a silver medal. He then traveled to Rome, where he was commissioned a bust of il Giordani; then traveled to United States."

  "text" : "Lupold von Wedel (25 January 1544 – 13 June 1612/1615) was a German travel writer, mercenary leader and landowner. He was the son of Kurt (Curdt) von Wedel (died 1552) and his second wife Anna von Borcke (died 1573). After the death of his father, he attended school for a short while in Stargard, but soon became a squire to the mercenary leader Vollrad von Mansfeld (1520-1578) and traveled and fought at his side all over Germany. This was to shape the rest of his life. In the years from 1561 to 1606 he traveled the world as a soldier, later as a mercenary leader, a war reporter and travel writer. In 1566 he took part in the campaign against the Turks in Hungary. He also fought on the side of the Protestants in 1575 and 1591 in the Huguenot Wars in France, the Cologne War 1583-1584 and the Strasbourg Bishops' War 1592-1593. He traveled to the Holy Land, to Egypt (1578-1579), Italy, Spain and Portugal (1580-1581) and from August 1584 to May 1585 to England and Scotland. His notes about his stays in Franconia (1593) and Karlsbad are also historically valuable. Wedel was only married at the age of 54, on 13 September 1598, to Anna von Eickstedt (1560-1629), the daughter of the Pomeranian chancellor Valentin von Eickstedt (1527-1579), lord at Klempenow, and Anna von Jasmund (1539-1607)."

  "text" : "Lane Sutton (born 1997) is an American young entrepreneur and public speaker on social media and marketing issues. Sutton first became known to the public at the age of 13 when The Boston Globe recognized him for meeting Tony Hsieh, speaking at PodCamp, early start to entrepreneurship and using the computer \"at barely 8\", and his experience. Lane became a subject of national interest at the age of 14 when being featured in The Wall Street Journal for a guest lecture at an Emerson College social media marketing class where he advised students about how to work big brands' social campaigns, as well as  Forbes and CNN. Since May 2010, Lane has been a public speaker about the world of social media, marketing, youth, privacy, and reaching the younger generation. Lane has also been a strong advocate for privacy to promote the dangers of oversharing and the importance of maintaining a positive reputation online. He has lectured before large audiences of both students and adults across the United States. At the age of 11, Lane created a website, Kid Critic to feature reviews by a kid, for kids and families about movies, books, activities, products, all from a youth perspective. The website encouraged kids to have a place to find interests as kids. Sutton attended and spoke at the 2012 SXSW Interactive. In September 2013, Lane spoke at the TEDxRedmond conference."

  "text" : "Lucie Berger (15 April 1836 - 8 March 1906) was a pioneer for the education of girls in France. Lucie Berger was born into a progressive family, the publishers Berger-Levrault, being the sixth child of the lawyer Frédéric Berger and Eléonore Levrault. When Lucie was one year old, her father died and her mother took over the family printing business, which already had some 200 employees. Her brother, the philatelist Oscar Berger-Levrault, took over the business in 1850. In 1866 Lucie began working as secretary to the committee of the Strasbourg Deaconesses. In 1871, with the help of the Deaconesses, Lucie opened an institute for young middle-class girls, in a building bought from the Catholic institution the Bon Pasteur (the Good Shepherd) and became its first director. The school retained the name 'Bon Pasteur'. This building now serves as a clinic - the \"Clinique des diaconesses\", which is adjacent to the current premises of the school. Beginning with 16 boarders and one day-pupil, the school grew rapidly. By 1873 there were 30 boarders and 28 day-pupils and by 1890 there were 16 separate classes.It was the first private school in Strasbourg to offer a secondary education diploma. In 1896 Lucie Berger added a gymnasium to the school, reflecting her conviction of the importance of physical education. By 1910 there was 600 pupils. In 1918, when Alsace returned to France, the school was renamed Collège Lucie Berger.In 2005 it merged with the Jean Sturm Gymnasium, under the name 'Pôle éducatif Jan-Amos-Comenius', thus becoming the largest private Protestant educational institution in France."

  "text" : "Laura Esther Rodríguez Dulanto (1872–1919) was the first female physician in Peru. She was born October 18, 1872 in Supe (then Chancay District, currently department of Lima), as the daughter of Marcelo Rodriguez and Cristina Dulanto. Having finished the basic studies that were available to her in her hometown, she moved with her parents to Lima. She completed her primary education and, after the arduous efforts of her parents appealing to the educational authorities, she was granted the possibility of periodic examinations before a Special Jury appointed by the Ministry of Education for the purpose of advancing her career. She thus became the first woman in Peru to enter university, in May 1892. In 1899 she obtained the degree of Bachelor of Medicine. She finally vowed as physician and surgeon on October 25, 1900, at the Faculty of Medicine of San Marcos University. Although another woman, the Ecuadorian Inés Guideline, also attended the school, there is no proof that she obtained any title. She specialized in the practice of gynecology, publishing numerous papers in this area, including papers on ovarian cysts and uterine fibroids. However, she alsostudied tuberculosis, presenting a paper on the subject at the Sixth Pan American Medical Congress held in 1913. She taught and practiced her trade in the Normal School for Women, the Liceo Fanning, the Convent of the Conception and of the Nazarenes. She also organized a School of Nursing, personally taking charge of dictating the course of Anatomy, Physiology and Hygiene. Given the escalation of border conflict between Peru and Ecuador, in 1910 she founded the Patriotic Union of Ladies; she also donated surgical equipment for the implementation of the Military Hospital. She died in Lima after a long illness on July 6 of 1919. Her initiative paved the way for other women in her country, and in 1906 Julia Iglesias became the first Peruvian pharmaceutical graduate in San Marcos. It would, however, more than a quarter century until another Peruvian woman obtained the medical degree; Maria Mercedes Cisneros did so in 1929."

  "text" : "Reverend Lord Archibald Edward Douglas (1850–1938), the son of Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry and his wife Caroline Margaret Clayton, daughter of General Sir William Clayton, 5th Baronet (1786–1866). Reverend Lord Archibald Douglas was a Roman Catholic priest who arranged the emigration of children to Canada, many going to the Ottawa area, to Manitoba, and into Quebec between 1882 - 1886. In 1874, Father Lord Archibald Douglas became Head of St Vincent’s Home for Destitute Boys, in Brook Green Lane, Hammersmith, London. There he started a printing press and bakery to provide work for the boys. The home moved to 333/339 Harrow Road, Paddington, London in 1876. He used his own private means to purchase and ran the Home, and was assisted for a time by his sister Gertrude. He changed the policy of the Home, and took in boys of greatest need. Under Father Douglas a threefold development took place. 1.  \n*  Boys from all parts of the country for whom no patron could be found were received.  2.  \n*  Appeal was made to the public conscience for funds.  3.  \n*  A new and great development was made in organising the emigration of children to Canada. Rev. Lord Archibald Douglas edited a monthly magazine, called Boys and Girls and published by The Southwark Diocesan Council and Rescue Society, to encourage interest and support for its work. Father Douglas first arrived in Canada on 2 July 1882 aboard the Peruvian. Accompanying him were his first party of children. He accompanied a group of forty boys to Manitoba. Exactly when the Southwark Catholic Emigration Society was formed is unclear, but the first formal report of the arrival in Canada of children sent by the Southwark Society dates to 1893 when 45 boys landed at Quebec. The following year there were 17 more. Over the next three years a further 84 boys were sent, taken either by the Rev. Edward St John or by the Rev. Lord Archibald Douglas, the joint secretaries overseeing the emigration. Lord Archibald Douglas was instrumental in the formation of the Canadian Catholic Emigration Society, which was headquartered in Westminster, London. The Society absorbed the emigration work of the Southwark Rescue Society which commenced in 1892, and the work of emigration of the archdiocese of Westminster. A reception Home (New Orpington Lodge, later St. George's Home) was established in Hintonburg, Ottawa in 1895. In addition, land was obtained in Manitoba in 1895, and in 1897 the New Southwark Training Farm was opened in the village of Makinak in the Lake Dauphin district of Manitoba. The Society selected the children from poor law and industrial schools and other sources, to send them under escort to Canada and incidentally to supervise the work of the agency there. Parties of 40 to 60 children were sent out at intervals. On retirement, by which time he was close to bankruptcy, he returned to his native Scotland, and St Vincent was given over to Father Douglas Hope."

  "text" : "Luis Gabriel Aguilera was a teacher at Bronzeville Scholastic Institute (part of the Chicago Public Schools) who was fired in 2009. Aguilera claimed that he was fired because of a memoir he had published nine years previously, which chronicles his experiences as a young Mexican immigrant and details a relationship he had with a teacher in the Chicago Public School system while he was a minor, while the Board of Education of the City of Chicago maintains that Aguilera was fired for having an inappropriate relationship with a female student.  In September 2014, Judge Virginia M. Kendall ruled in a summary judgement against Aguilera, siding with the Board of Education of the City of Chicago. Kendall wrote that the board did not violate Aguilera's right to due process, nor did it violate Aguilera's First Amendment right to free speech. Judge Kendall ruled that Aguilera was fired on the basis of the inappropriate relationship he had with his student, and not on the basis of his memoir, and therefore the termination of Aguilera's employment was lawful. Aguilera has also written about activism and the Chicago Public Schools and is an electronic music DJ."

Each of their stories vividly shows how an individual can make a difference. Positive change in the world occurs because of the combined efforts of individuals and it is something in which we can all take part.\" - His Holiness The Dalai Lama\"The play on words in the title is quite thought- provoking because in order to effect positive change in this world, you should aspire to have A NOBLE SPIRIT.

I wish the best of success to this inspiring and educational book. I hope that the eventful stories of these extraordinary people, their dedication and sacrifice, their suffering and their triumphs, will motivate you to perform noble deeds of your own.\"- Mikhail Gorbachev\"Every generation must walk its own journey but it is necessary to see the footsteps of those who have walked with dignity, wisdom, success, and virtue before us. Young people must be heard no doubt, but they must also be given meaningful information and not just superficiality and entertainment.\" Livia Malcangio.Malcangio is a citizen of the world, with a Columbian grandmother and two Swiss sons who directly descend from Niklaus von Flüe, the Swiss Patron Saint honoured among both Protestants and Catholics with the permanent national unity of Switzerland.

  "text" : "Lars Erik Taxell (6 April 1913 – 7 October 2013), was a Finnish legal scholar and politician. He was the leader of the Swedish People's Party of Finland in 1956-1966. He was also the Rector of the Åbo Akademi University in Turku, Finland, in the 1950s and its chancellor in the 1980s. Taxell was born in Vaasa, in the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1913. He studied law at the University of Helsinki. He earned a PhD in law in 1946, which dealt with the fundamental question of the relationship between democracy and the rule of law. In 1948-1976, he was a professor of private law with jurisprudence at the Åbo Academy. His extensive scientific production were mainly corporate law and contract law, later also issues related to law and democracy. As the first person from Finland, Taxell was awarded the Nordic Lawyer Prize in 1984. He served as Chancellor of Åbo Akademy University in 1981-1984, the early years when the private Åbo Akademy became a state university. In 1975 Taxell became a honorary doctor at the Faculty of law at Stockholm University. In 1956 Taxell succeeded Ernst von Born as the leader of the Swedish People's Party, the Swedish-speaking minority and mainly liberal party in Finland; a position he held until 1966 when he was succeeded by Jan-Magnus Jansson. He had a central role in the agreement whereby the Finnish government in 1981 took over the financial responsibility for the private university Åbo Akademi, while the Åbo Akademi Foundation maintained its independent status. Taxell died in 2013 at the age of 100, in Åbo, Finland."

  "text" : "Charlotta \"Lotten\" Christina Wennberg (3 June 1815 in Stockholm - 4 November 1864), was a Swedish philanthropist. Lotten Wennberg was the daughter of the rich landowner J. O. Wennberg. During her early life, she spent her winters in the capital, where she participated in society life, and her summers on Yxe Manor in Nora Mountain District, where she handed out supplies to the poor, as was expected from an upper class woman. However, she expanded her activity and also started collections of funds to provide poor also from neighboring parishes with supplies. In 1835, her father died: at the time of his death, his affairs was in disorder, and for a while, there were a risk that the family were to be bankrupt. This did not happen, but the risk is said to have made her decide to make philanthropy her main task in life. In Stockholm, she was constantly active in various charitable activities, providing homes for the homeless, health care for the sick, education for children, supplies for the starved, wood for the frozen, work for the unemployed, \"with the same gravity, as if she had been appointed to this task by the state and awarded accordingly by salary\". She was to have done this with great energy and good humor: in contrast to what was usual for a contemporary philanthropist, she did not combine her help with religious preaching, but it is known that she did ask for a review from the local parish about the character from the person in question before she agreed to help. Normally, Wennberg helped by simply applying for help in the appropriate poor care, but she did also ask for funds from private contributors and occasionally provided funds herself. Lotten Wennberg was a member of the Jakobs- och Johannis' församlingars Fruntimmers-Skyddsförening (The Women's Protection Society of the Jakob- and Johannis Parishes) and several other of the charitable societies of the capital were women were admitted. During the cholera of Stockholm in 1853, she was the secretary in the St Jakobs församlingskomittée av den stora välgörenhetsförening för fattiga barn och nödlidande (The St Jakob Parish' Comity of the Great Charity Committee for the Poor Children and The Needing), where she is described as the leading force by Fredrika Bremer, who were also a member. Her charitable work was described by Fredrika Bremer and Emily Nonnen for Wilhelmina Stålberg, who included her in her dictionary of notable Swedish women in 1864. In 1864, Lotten Wennberg was granted a golden medal for her work in Stockholm by king Charles XV of Sweden. She died of cancer. After her death, the queen, Louise of the Netherlands, founded the charity society Lotten Wennbergs fond för hjälpbehöfvande (The Lotten Wennberg Fund for the Needing) to her memory."

He studied medicine at the Universities of Marburg, Berlin and Würzburg, and following graduation worked as a general practitioner in Wetzlar and Altenkirchen. In 1843 he was privat-docent to the medical faculty at Bonn, where he became an associate professor in 1847. In 1856 he was appointed professor of anatomy and physiology at the University of Greifswald. He is known for his anatomical and physiological investigations of the autonomic nervous system, discovering that sympathetic nerve stimulation brings about pupillary dilatation and that oculomotor nerve stimulus produces constriction. With neurophysiologist Augustus Volney Waller, he was awarded the Prix Montyon by the French Academie des Sciences for research in identifying the segments of spinal cord that control operation of the ciliary muscles. The eponymous \"Budge's center\" is a synonym for the ciliospinal center. With Leonard Landois, he demonstrated the phenomena of cardiac arrest during electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve,. Also, he is credited with providing a comprehensive description of the liver's bile capillaries, and conducted significant research involving the construction and growth of muscle associated with bile ducts."

  "text" : "Leonardo Tejada (Latacunga, 1908 - Quito, 2005) was an Ecuadorian painter whose work was known for its Social Realism and Expressionism. Tejada was born into a family of wood carvers, ad himself used wood in his art. He was a folklore scholar and an initiator of the folk art revival of Ecuador. In 1923 he enrolled in the School of Fine Arts in Quito, from which he graduated in 1930. He was one of the founders of the House of Ecuadorian Culture. From a young age he created art that expressed the social reality of his people. He employed watercolor, oil, and wood carving in his art. He is credited largely in the revival of folk art in Ecuador. He held his first exhibition of folk art in the House of Ecuadorian Culture in 1952. He also contributed to the revival of Ecuador's indigenous sculptural art. Since the 1970s he incorporated recyclable materials in his works, including rags, cords, and other materials, seeking more expression from the materials themselves. He also worked as a teacher in various countries, such as Costa Rica and Venezuela. Even in school Tejada, like most artists, showed a tendency to think outside the box. Not interested in academics, he spent his time painting. His uniqueness lay in his rooting his paintings in the prevalent social situation. It was this closeness and desire to depict social life that gave Tejada's work a sociopolitical dignity. His approach also made him immensely popular in his country. His oil paintings are specially candid and painfully honest, depicting misery and poverty of the people. His contribution to wood engraving in Ecuador is equally important. He is credited with starting a renaissance of sorts in wood engraving. His exhibition of Folk Art, set in 1952 at the House of Ecuadorian Culture is also seen as an important step in reviving folk art in Ecuador. He died in Quito on January 30, 2005 at 97 years of age. In 2003 he was awarded Ecuador's national prize Premio Eugenio Espejo in the field of art."

  "text" : "Luo Hongxian (Chinese: 羅洪先; 1504–1564) was a Ming dynasty Chinese cartographer. After passing the Imperial Examinations with the rank of jinshi in 1529, Luo worked as a senior compiler at the Hanlin Academy. He was a student of the philosophies of the Neo-Confucian Wang Yangming. Hearing of raids by wokou pirates on China's south-eastern shores, he began collating cartographical information for the Ming government, spending three years in research. During this period, he discovered the Yutu (Terrestrial Map), an atlas of China created by Zhu Siben during the Yuan dynasty some 300 years earlier, which he adapted and expanded to create his Guang yu tu 廣與圖 (Enlarged territorial atlas), a work that covered the entire country. It was first published in 1561, and remained the principal reference work in Chinese cartography until the 17th century. Based on his Guang yu tu, Martino Martini, an Italian Jesuit in China, drew his own Novus Atlas Sinensis, published in Amsterdam by Joan Blaeu in 1655. Martini's map remained the standard European view of China until 1737, when Jean Baptiste d'Anville published his Atlas de la Chine. Luo's maps and geographical knowledge were put to use in the defense of the coast, and he was offered several government posts as a result; he declined these offers."

The NSA acquired his complete collection of wildlife recordings in the mid-1990s. In 1968, he was described by the BBC as \"the only full-time freelance recordist of wildlife sounds in Britain\". He was the subject of a BBC television The World About Us episode, screened on 9 April 1972, and appeared on several other BBC television and radio programmes in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was manager of the Minack Theatre, Porthcurno, Cornwall.

  "text" : "Louis Elliman (1906 – 1965), was an Irish impresario and theatre manager. Elliman was born in Dublin, a son of Maurice Elliman, who had fled from Tsarist persecution in Russia. He was educated at Synge Street CBS. His father became involved in cinema by establishing the Theatre De Luxe in Camden St. in 1912. After university Louis started work at a pharmacy but after a few years gave that up to become a film agent in London. In the meantime Maurice acquired Dublin's Gaiety Theatre, which was passed on to Louis. In the early 1930s, Louis Elliman sold a 50% share in the Gaiety to entrepreneur Patrick Wall, a Clare man. The pair also owned the Metropole and the Savoy cinemas. Along with Patrick Wall, Elliman acquired the Theatre Royal, Dublin in 1936. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Wall and Elliman were forced to keep the two theatres going with native talent only. This led to the emergence of a raft of Irish acts who were to provide the mainstay of the Royal's output for the remainder of its existence. These included such Irish household names as Jimmy O'Dea, Harry O'Donovan, Maureen Potter, Danny Cummins, Mike Nolan, Alice Dalgarno, Noel Purcell, Micheál MacLiammoir, Cecil Sheridan, Jack Cruise, Paddy Crosbie and Patricia Cahill. In July 1951 Judy Garland appeared for a series of sold out performances at the Royal and was received with tremendous ovations. The legendary singer sang from her dressing room window to hundreds of people who were unable to get tickets and critics dubbed her \"America's Colleen\" Popular Irish American entertainer Carmel Quinn also made her singing debut in the Theatre Royal during the early 1950s. After a spell acquiring cinemas around the country, which were taken over by the Rank Organization, Louis went into film production. In 1957 he opened Ardmore Studios. With managing director Emmet Dalton he travelled to the US to promote the studios and to acquire foreign investment. The studios accordingly landed its first major foreign booking with 1959's Shake Hands with the Devil, starring Oscar winner James Cagney and Dana Wynter. A year later progress was consolidated when Robert Mitchum appeared in Tay Garnett's \"A Terrible Beauty\". In 1961, Ardmore Studios hosted the controversial \"The Mark\", directed by Guy Green, which was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and earned its star, Stuart Whitman, an Oscar nomination. Other films produced at this time include Don Chaffey's The Webster Boys and \"Johnny Nobody\" with Cyril Cusack. Hammer Films also utilised the studios as a base for their production, The Viking Queen. The studios went into receivership in 1963 but re-opened later. Under pressure from rising overheads and the increasing popularity of the cinema and the introduction of television, the Theatre Royal closed its doors on 30 June 1962. By this time Louis was dogged by bad health and died in 1965."

  "text" : "Lloyd J. Reynolds (1902-1978) was an American calligrapher and professor at Reed College (1929-1969) who taught classes on creative writing, art, and calligraphy. Lloyd Reynolds was born in 1902 in Bemidji, Minnesota. He received a BA in Botany and Forestry from Oregon State University, then an English degree at the University of Oregon. He went on to receive an MA in English literature from the University of Oregon. Reynolds started at Reed in 1929 in the English Department, teaching creative writing, then began teaching classes on art history and graphic arts. Reynolds classes continued for several decades, and his students included Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, Peter Norton, Charles Bigelow, David Eddings  Willard McCarty, Kris Holmes, Sumner Stone and informally Steve Jobs. Starting in 1949, Reynolds began teaching calligraphy classes at Reed, and retired from Reed and his last class in 1969. The calligraphy program at Reed was continued by Robert Palladino until the cancellation of the program by the college in 1984. In 1954, Reynolds was targeted in the House Un-American Activities Committee, as were two other Reed professors. He reportedly refused to testify at the hearing. Reynolds was named Calligrapher Laureate of Oregon by Governor Tom McCall in 1972. He died in October 1978. The Reed College Special Collections houses the Lloyd J. Reynolds Collection. The Cooley Gallery hosted the exhibition \"Lloyd Reynolds: A Life of Forms in Art\" in 2011."

An earlier bishop, Lambert I, is sometimes (erroneously) called \"Lambert of Vignory\" also. Lambert's episcopate is known from one charter of 1111, wherein Count William II of Nevers donated the proprietary church of Saint-Aignan de Tonnerre, which had been passed down in his family, to the abbey of Molême. He proclaimed he did this for the benefit of the souls of himself, his father, Count Reginald II of Nevers, his mother, Agnes, his uncle, Count William I, and his other uncle, the late bishop, Robert. He dated his charter to the time when \"the lord Lambert was elected in the diocese of Langres\"."
