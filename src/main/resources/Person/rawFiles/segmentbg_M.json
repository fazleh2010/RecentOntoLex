He studied first at Saint Petersburg Conservatory, then at Vienna Conservatory from 1905 to 1909. He sang leading roles at the Vienna Volksoper and the Landestheater Linz (where he was known as Michael Shuisky) and had signed long-term contracts to sing in Salzburg and Hamburg before the outbreak of the First World War. When war broke out, he returned to Russia, where he completed his career. He was a leading baritone in the Theatre of Opera and Drama in Saint Petersburg; Kiev Opera and Ballet Theatre; Odessa Opera and Ballet Theatre; and the Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre. Shuisky was made an Honored Artist of Russia in 1945 and received the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1946. He died in Perm shortly before his 70th birthday. A bust of Shuisky was displayed at an art exhibition in 1951 and is kept in the museum of the Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre."

By the age of 29, Kim had graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, to work as a prosecutor in US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York. During his tenure one of his most important cases was the prosecution of the $75 million Sterling Foster scam, a crime that would be the inspiration for the movie Boiler Room. Before settling in New York City, Kim spent time living in Dubai, Europe, and Costa Rica, where he learned to speak fluent Spanish. He also served as a U.S. Army infantry officer. In the summer of 2003, alongside colleague Steven Kobre from the US Attorney's Office, Kim opened the litigation firm Kobre & Kim. Their entrepreneurship turned out to be a ground-breaking achievement as it was the first time in 20 years that alumni from the US Attorney’s Office in Manhattan had started their own firm immediately after government service. Since then, the firm expanded from New York to include 9 offices including London, Hong Kong, Seoul, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Miami, Washington DC, and San Francisco. Kim relocated to Seoul in 2015 to focus on disputes and investigations in Korea. Kim has been involved in various notable litigations including defending Brian Hunter, an energy trader, who faced an enforcement action brought by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; advising the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in seeking to recover over US $100 million in unpaid taxes from the founder of ComputerLand Corp., William H. Millard; and obtaining a US $30 million award on behalf of U.S. Airways against Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. before a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration panel in New York. He was profiled in a New York Times article on the growing corporate outing practice of shooting at a range. Kim was quoted as saying \"we do very aggressive litigation and trial work so we prefer an activity that dovetails nicely with that aggressive culture, and hitting a little white ball on the greens doesn't do much for us.\""

Raised in Los Angeles and schooled in modern dance, Steinberg became a formative member of the dancer-illusionist company MOMIX in 1983. They became known for their visual humour and contorted positions. In 1986, she co-founded the ISO dance company, which embodied an approach they called \"serious fun\" and sometimes collaborated with a singing group, and gave performances around the country and abroad. In both companies she did choreography as well as dancing. She staged her own experimental dance solo production and did choreographic work for films and music videos. Starting in the mid-1990s, she branched out into lighting design and film directing as well, with dance usually being the subject matter. She has continued with various projects into the 2010s, often collaborating with the Japanese choreographer and dancer Oguri. Together they are co-founders of the production company Arcane Collective. Steinberg became involved with U2 when she appeared in the 1987 music video for \"With Or Without You\", then was hired as a choreographer, and subsequently as a belly dancer for \"Mysterious Ways\", during their 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour. By the end of the tour she was in a relationship with The Edge. The couple has two children together, married in 2002, and live at residences in Ireland, France, and the United States."

  "text" : "Meir Vilner (Hebrew: מאיר וילנר, born Ber Kovner; 23 October 1918 – 5 June 2003) was an Israeli communist politician and Jewish leader of the Communist Party of Israel (Maki), which consisted primarily of Israeli Arabs. He was the youngest and longest surviving signatory of the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948. Born in Vilnius, German-occupied Lithuania, Vilner's political life began as the leader of the socialist-Zionist group Hashomer Hatzair (Young Guard). However, he soon grew disenchanted by what he viewed as a tendency in Zionist groups to dream of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, rather than change their current situation - thus he started working for the banned Polish Communist Party - now under the pseudonym Meir Vilner - until 1938, when he left Poland to go to the British Mandate of Palestine. Most of his family perished in the Holocaust. Vilner then studied history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In what would soon become Israel, Vilner was disenchanted with the politics, claiming that the hatred directed at Jews in Vilna was now directed at the Arabs. He joined the Palestine Communist Party (PCP), which accepted Arab and Jewish membership, but supported partition. Vilner criticized both the British and Israeli government, but justified signing the Israeli Declaration of Independence on the grounds that this would eliminate another British colony. Besides, the PCP stressed that the Charter contained a promise to help implement the UN resolutions providing for two independent states, Israel and Arab Palestine, and to uphold full equality and civil liberties for all Israeli citizens. In 1949, he was elected to the Knesset as a member of Maki. He resigned from the Knesset in December 1959, six weeks after the 1959 elections, but was re-elected in 1961. However, he resigned again two months after the 1961 elections. As the Jewish leader of the Communist party of Israel (CPI), 95% of whose members are Arabs, he rejected Zionism, publicised the Israeli nuclear weapons programme in 1963, and opposed the imposition of martial rule on Israeli Arabs (it was lifted in 1966). In 1965 Vilner and several other Maki members broke away from the party to form the new party Rakah following disagreements about the Soviet Union's increasingly anti-Israeli stance (Vilner was on the USSR's side), and was elected to the Knesset on the new party's list in the 1965 elections. On June 5, 1967, Vilner was the sole Jewish deputy (joined only by fellow Communist Party of Israel deputy Tawfik Toubi) to speak out in the Knesset against the Six-Day War. Calling that day the darkest in Israel's history, Vilner demanded an immediate halt to the Israeli invasion of Arab-occupied lands. Vilner stressed that there was no other way to solve the conflict between Israel and its neighbors but mutual recognition of the national rights of Israelis and Arabs, including the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and independent statehood. On October 15, he was badly wounded by a member of the right-wing party Gahal. Rakah became part of Hadash before the 1977 elections, and Vilner remained an MK until 1990 when he resigned as part of a seat rotation agreement, making him the third longest serving after Tawfik Toubi and Shimon Peres. Vilner's Soviet loyalist line was highly appreciated by the USSR; in 1978 he was awarded the Order of Friendship of Peoples. He did not accept perestroika and regarded the fall of communism in the USSR as a coup. He was married to Esther Vilenska, another Israeli communist politician but divorced later, after having two sons together. His cousin Abba Kovner was a well-known Israeli poet. Vilner was buried in the Yarkon Cemetery, Tel Aviv, beside the grave of his life companion Golda Ita Vilner (1903 - 2000). He is survived by two sons and two grandchildren."

Born in Cairo, Egypt in 1936, Hathout eventually moved to Buffalo, New York, and then to Los Angeles. He immersed himself in volunteering at the Islamic Center of Southern California (ICSC) as Chairman and Spokesperson. One of the most progressive mosques in the country – the ICSC had a woman on its board of directors in 1952 – the Islamic Center became a vehicle for a vision of Islam in America that is rooted in what Hathout called the definition of home: \"Home is not where my grandparents are buried, but where my grandchildren will be raised.\" Hathout stressed throughout his life that being a faithful Muslim was entirely compatible with being a proud American, and that Islam is a religion of coexistence, reason and moderation. He was also among the pioneers of interfaith engagement within the American Muslim community, helping found the Religious Coalition Against War in the Middle East with Rev. George Regas and Rabbi Leonard Beerman in 1991. Hathout was a charter member of the Pacific Council on International Policy, the western partner of the Council on Foreign Relations, and served on the Board of Directors of the Interfaith Alliance and Claremont Lincoln University. Over the years, Hathout was invited repeatedly to Capitol Hill and the State Department to address a variety of topics, such as \"Islam and U.S. Policy,\" \"Islamic Democracy,\" \"Emerging Trends in Islamic Movements,\" and \"The Future of the Middle East.\" He was also the first Muslim invited to give the invocation prayer at the Democratic National Convention in 2000. Hathout was the recipient of many awards, including the George Regas Courageous Peacemaker Award, the Islamic Shura Council of Southern California’s Lifetime Service Award, the South Coast Interfaith Council Award for his lifelong commitment to interfaith work and the Los Angeles County John Allen Buggs Award for excellence in human relations. He died of cancer in Duarte, California on January 3, 2015."

  "text" : "Michael Liam McQuillan is a Scottish mathematician studying algebraic geometry. McQuillan received the doctorate in 1993 at Harvard University under Barry Mazur (\"Division points on semi-Abelian varieties\"). Later he was at All Souls College of the University of Oxford and in 2009 was Professor at the University of Glasgow as well as Advanced Research Fellow of the British Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. As of 2013 he is Professor at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. McQuillan's research interests are in algebraic geometry. In his dissertation he proved a twenty-year-old conjecture of Serge Lang about semi-Abelian varieties. He extended the theory developed by Paul Vojta (an analogy of the Nevanlinna theory, part of the value distribution theory of holomorphic functions, to diophantine geometry) and applied the method of dynamic diophantine approximation which he developed in the process, to transcendental algebraic geometry (and therefore for varieties over the complex numbers, where methods of complex analysis can be used). In particular he solved or made progress on several conjectures about the hyperbolicity of subvarieties of algebraic varieties. For example, he gave a new proof of a conjecture of André Bloch (1926) about holomorphic curves in closed subvarieties of Abelian varieties, proved a conjecture of Shoshichi Kobayashi (about the Kobayashi-hyperbolicity of generic hypersurfaces of high degree in projective n-dimensional space) in the three-dimensional case and achieved partial results on a conjecture of Mark Green and Phillip Griffiths (which states that a holomorphic curve on an algebraic surface of general type with cannot be Zariski-dense). He has also investigated algebraic differential equations on varieties and works on non-commutative Mori theory. In 2000 he received the EMS Prize. In 2001 he was awarded the Whitehead Prize of the London Mathematical Society for his work. In 2002 he was invited speaker at the ICM at Peking (Integrating ). In 2001 he received the Whittaker Prize."

  "text" : "Melvin J Berman (14 January 1915 – 20 February 1996), was a prominent land developer in Maryland. He was instrumental in the creation of Columbia, Maryland along with his development partner James Rouse. In 1932, Melvin J. Berman moved from DeFuniak Springs, Florida near the Alabama border to Howard County. He hitchhiked to Baltimore, working in the dairy business for his uncle. He met his first business partner, a dairy distributor, Arthur V. Robinson soon after. Berman partnered with his younger brother Wolford also. In 1952 the assets of Highland Farm#2 \"Olney Acres\" became available at auction. In November 1955 Robinson became a member of the Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Association Inc. Robinson used the association money to purchase Olney Acres dairy farm in Howard County, Maryland from his partner Berman for $1,000,000. He hired Berman, and used company funds to buy additional property surrounding the farm while providing salaries to each other from the cooperative. Roberts then resold the properties to himself and his family, and resold them again to Aladdin Construction Corporation developer Joseph Martelleni, forming Hammond Village in the process. In 1961 Berman and Robinson also partnered on a second milk plant in New York. Robinson did not have to appear in trial for fraud, because he died in a takeoff crash his twin engine aircraft from Baltimore. In 1954, they built the Ingleside Shopping center, from onsite offices, The Investment Corporation of Maryland purchased and developed the J Frank Gwynn farm in what would eventually become Columbia Maryland. In 1956, Berman started land development, building the Laurel Shopping Center."

The influence of Franz Boas, whom she also knew at Columbia, may be seen in Foster’s interests in symbolism and language origins. In addition to writing grammars of Sierra Popoluca and Purépecha, she published several articles purporting to reconstruct spoken Primordial Language (PL). PL, she maintained, was constructed out of speech sounds she dubbed ‘phememes’ that were at the same time roots, whose meaning was motivated by the shaping and movement of the vocal tract."

  "text" : "Mary Elvira Weeks (1892–1975) was an American chemist and science historian who wrote Discovery of the Elements. Weeks earned a bachelor's in chemistry in 1913 and shortly thereafter a master's degree. Initially, she worked as a high school teacher and chemical technician. In 1921, she took a job as a college instructor at the University of Kansas, where she achieved her Ph.D. in 1927. At Kansas, she carried a heavy teaching load and did not do extensive research. Because her interests leaned to the humanities, Weeks was drawn to the history of chemistry. From 1932-1933, Weeks wrote a series of 21 articles on the discovery of the elements for the Journal of Chemical Education. The articles were collected and published in book form in 1935. Discovery of the Elements went through several editions over the years. Both book and the earlier articles were liberally illustrated with pictures of chemists from the collection of Frank B. Dains, an older Kansas colleague of Weeks. In 1944, Weeks moved from Kansas to become a research librarian at Wayne State University. In 1946 or 1947, she began collaborating with Charles A. Browne on a retrospective history of the American Chemical Society. Browne was responsible for the structure of the project and about half the chapters. After Browne's death in 1947, Weeks continued the project to completion. A History of the American Chemical Society—Seventy-five Eventful Years was published in 1952. Weeks retired from Wayne State in 1954 and remained in Detroit. In 1968, she won the ACS's Dexter Award."

  "text" : "Malcolm Beckwith Parkes (26 June 1930 - 10 May 2013), credited as an author as M. B. Parkes, was an English paleographer, notable for his contributions to the scholarship of medieval manuscripts. His studies of the manuscripts of Geoffrey Chaucer and William Langland were especially important, and his 1978 article \"The Production of Copies of the 'Canterbury Tales'\" was described as \"seminal\". Parkes was a student of Neil Ripley Ker and wrote his B.Litt. thesis on the Secretary hand. From 1965 to 1997 he was a fellow at Keble College, Oxford, and held a personal chair in paleography in the University of Oxford. At Keble he taught Old and Middle English language and literature. Among his important individual achievements are the dating of the Oxford MS. of The Song of Roland and his work on early manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales (with Ian Doyle), still considered a standard. His 1969 book English Cursive Book Hands, 1250-1500 is \"the authoritative account\", according to David Ganz, and its formatting is still employed by other scholars. His work on punctuation (Pause and Effect: an Introduction to the History of Punctuation in the West, 1993) focuses on \"visual reading aids\" and was highly influential. His Lyell Lectures at Oxford discussed the prosopography of English scribes and proved him an erudite and entertaining lecturer. He compiled a catalogue of Keble College's medieval manuscripts which was published in 1979 by Scolar Press, London. Parkes was elected to the Comité international de paléographie latine in 1986 and was a corresponding fellow of the Medieval Academy of America from 1992. He died on 10 May 2013."

He was enlisted in service at Akershus Castle during 1557 and 1561. In 1559, he was in charge of the blockhouse on the island of Flekkeroy in Kristiansand. In 1565, he was assigned a command in the region of Solør, which shared an eastern border with Sweden. During the Northern Seven Years' War, Swedish forces launched attacks into Eastern Norway. Mogens Svale fought several successful battles against invading Swedish armies in this border area. In 1568, he was promoted to the rank of Captain."

Tanenbaum studied at the Warsaw University. Since 1935 he was member of the Jewish Socialist Youth organization \"Frajhajt\" (part of Poale Zion). After the outbreak of World War II and German occupation of Poland Tenenbaum became a member of the Anti-Fascist Bloc. He organized the resistance against the Germans in Wilno and Warsaw. As member of the Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa he was sent in 1943 to Białystok to bolster the resistance. Together with Daniel Moszkowicz he led the uprising in the Białystok Ghetto. Tenenbaum and Moszkowicz are believed to have committed suicide when their bunker was surrounded by German troops. After the war to honor Tenenbaum a square in Białystok was renamed after him."

After retiring to raise two children, she returned after five years to swim across Lake Erie in Canada, and two firsts: the first double crossing of Cook Strait by a woman and a circumnavigation of Rarotonga. In the 1978 Queen's Birthday Honours, McKenzie was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for being the first New Zealand woman to swim the Cook Strait in both directions."

  "text" : "Matar Ebrahim Ali Matar (also spelled Mattar Mattar; Arabic: مطر إبراهيم علي مطر‎‎; born 3 May 1976) is a Bahraini politician of the Al Wefaq party who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from October 2010 until his resignation in early 2011. Born in the village of Al Daih to a large family with diverse political views, Matar completed his secondary education in Bahrain and moved to Kuwait to pursue higher education. He remained there until 2002 when he returned to Bahrain and joined Al Wefaq political party. Matar was politically active, working within committees in the party and meeting with foreign officials. In 2010, he won with a large margin in the Parliamentary election, becoming the youngest of all MPs and representing the country's largest constituency. When the Bahraini uprising started in early 2011, Matar joined the protests and gave several interviews to international media. Following government crackdown, he and other party MPs resigned from Parliament. Due to his activism, Matar was arrested by authorities in May. He was allegedly kept in solitary confinement and subjected to torture while in detention before getting tried before a military court. He was released in August and acquitted of charges in February 2012. His arrest, alleged mistreatment and subsequent release triggered several international reactions by international bodies and NGOs such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Inter-Parliamentary Union, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Following his release, Matar continued his political activism."

She played a political role in the struggle between Albert, King of Sweden and Queen Margaret I of Denmark over the Swedish throne in the late 14th century. Margareta Dume belonged to an originally German noble family who lived in Swedish Finland since 1362. In 1373, she married the powerful Bo Jonsson (Grip), and he gave important posts to her brothers. In 1386, she became a widow. In the will of her late spouse, she had been denied the larger part of his vast fortune and any influence upon his affairs. She contested this, left for the Swedish royal court and made the King the protector of her and her children's rights in the civil war-like conflict which erupted over the inheritance of her spouse in 1387. She also declared her support of King Albert as his ally and loyalist in his struggle against Queen Margaret. This made it possible for her to use the King's supporters in the great inheritance feud. It is noted that she had an important political position, as she exerted influence upon certain affairs of state due to her important support to the King: in 1388, for example, the King granted a member of the nobility the return of his confiscated property upon her request. She was present at the Swedish court in 1389, the same year Albert was deposed, but left for Germany after this. In 1394, she married the Swedish noble Bengt Niklisson, returned to Sweden with him and made her peace with Queen Margaret."

After she became a widow in 1699, she lived on Tyresö Palace, which she had inherited from her grandmother Maria Sofia De la Gardie. She translated foreign works, wrote a work of the life of Jesus which was published in 1730-36, and wrote 600 sonnets. She gathered a circle of professors on Tyresö and corresponded with among others Sophia Elisabet Brenner. She was described as one of the most learned women of her epoch, and it was said that this made her unpopular among the male aristocracy, because she was generally to superior to them. During the Russian Pillage of 1719-1721, when the Russians where sacking the territory, she made saved Tyresö Palace from being burnt. She tore down the towers of the palace, which, upon a distance, gave the Russians the impression that the palace had already been sacked: therefore, they turned back, and the palace was saved. Her documentation of the sacking is a valuable document over the contemporary historical infrastructure of the area."

  "text" : "The murder of Odin Lloyd occurred on June 17, 2013, in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. His death made international headlines when Aaron Hernandez, at the time a tight end for the New England Patriots of the National Football League, was investigated as a suspect in the case. Prior to his death, Lloyd had been a linebacker for a New England Football League (NEFL) semi-professional football team, the Boston Bandits, since 2007. Hernandez was arrested on June 26, 2013, nine days after Lloyd's death, and was charged with the murder. Ninety minutes after his arrest, Hernandez was released by the Patriots. On June 28, 2013, two other men, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, were also arrested in connection with Lloyd's death. Prosecutors say both men were with Hernandez when they drove to the place of murder. On August 22, 2013, Hernandez was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of Odin Lloyd. Nearly eight months later, Ortiz and Wallace were also indicted for the murder in the same crime. On April 15, 2015, Hernandez was found guilty of first-degree murder, as well as five weapon charges, automatically being sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. He is currently awaiting trial for two separate murder charges for the 2012 double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. On May 12, 2016, Wallace was acquitted of first-degree murder, but was convicted of being an accessory after the fact of the crime; he was sentenced to serve four-and-one-half to seven years in prison. On June 27, 2016, Ortiz, changed his not guilty plea and pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dropped the murder charge against Ortiz. He was also sentenced to serve four-and-one-half to seven years in prison."

Born ca. 1245, Holobolos entered the service of Michael VIII as a grammatikos in his teens, and composed several orations for the early years of Michael's reign that are an important primary source. In 1261, however, when Michael ordered the blinding and imprisonment of the legitimate emperor, John IV Laskaris (r. 1258–1261), Holobolos expressed public grief, and his lips and nose were mutilated as punishment. Holobolos then retired from public service and became a monk at the Prodromos Monastery in Constantinople, with the monastic name Maximos. In 1265/66, through the intervention of Patriarch Germanus III, Holobolos was able to get a post as a teacher, possibly at the orphanage of the Church of St. Paul. Because of his fervent anti-Unionism, he was exiled to the Megalou Agrou monastery on the Sea of Marmara in 1273, and was not allowed to return to the capital until after Michael's death, when his son and successor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) repudiated the Union. Thus Holobolos participated in the Council of Blachernae in 1285, which formally condemned the Union, and was restored to imperial favour: he received the title of rhetor and became protosynkellos by 1299. According to one of his students, George Galesiotes, he continued teaching until his death, sometime between 1310 and 1314."

On 27 December 1917, he was assigned the task of forming the first Regiment of the Red Cossacks Army, under the command of Mikhail Artemyevich Muravyov. In March 1918 he was appointed commandant of Poltava, one of his tasks being to defend the city against interventionists. The same month, acting as an intermediary between the Ekaterinoslav Federation of Anarchists and the Soviet authorities, he put an end to the armed conflict between anarchists and bolsheviks in Ekaterinoslav. In May 1918, after the German army entered the city, Baron and his anarchist troops retreated to Rostov-on-Don. The next month, in the Tsaritsyn area, they were disarmed by the Soviet authorities, like all other Ukrainian anarchist groups.In September, in the neutral zone, Baron and Vitaly Primakov set up the first Ukrainian Insurgent Division, which later became the Tarashcha Regiment. Baron was, for several months the Regiment's commanding Ataman. Later, he joined the Bolshevik Party."

  "text" : "Moshe Shilo (1920–1990) was a microbiologist working in the field of aquatic microbiology, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was influential in the development of modern microbial ecology . He was a life-long member of the American Society for Microbiology and was honored by being appointed their 1967 ONR lecturer, and by receiving the 1978 Fisher Award in Applied and Environmental Microbiology. His first encounter with aquatic microbiology and with an acute applied problem, came when he started to study the reasons for a 1947 severe outbreak of fish death in artificial fish ponds in Israel. He showed that growth of a toxic unicellular phytoflagellate—Prymnesium parvum and the synthesis of their toxins have different optimal requirements. The toxin turned out to be a proteo-lipid containing 15 amino acids, fatty acid and phosphates. This is one of the first toxins to be isolated in Algea and its toxic effects studied (). The combination of basic research on the regulation and action of the Prymnesium toxins, together with the development of field tests and the appropriate treatment of fishponds by ammonia and copper, eliminated this problem in aquaculture in Israel. Another set of landmark studies was initiated at the Solar Lake on the edge of the Red Sea, a small unique hypersaline body of water 20 km south of Eilat. The Solar Lake was established as a model for microbial interactions in extreme environments. The major studies included the discovery of anoxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria as a major evolutionary stage in the evolution of photosynthesis, and the diurnal shift between oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis (). In addition, the studies revealed a Microbial mat—these stratified benthic microbial communities, dominated by cyanobacteria, develop over the bottom of the Solar Lake. Such microbial mats are modern analogs to stromatolites: Precambrian laminated sedimentary rocks, which are the oldest known microfossils (dated to be 3.5 billion years old). During the last decade of his life, Shilo’s work focused on benthic cyanobacteria. Production of a hydrophobic external surface allows these organisms to adhere to submerged surfaces. Spreading through a planktonic phase occurs by formation of special cells that have a hydrophilic surface and detach from the mother cells, or transient secretion of substances that mask the hydrophobic surface (). These studies have pioneered the current trend in microbiology that focuses on mixed bacterial communities and the dynamic formation and dissociation of biofilms. Shilo's contributions to science in Israel included some significant contributions to Israel's scientific infrastructure. His major contribution in this field was the establishment of the Department of Microbial Molecular Ecology—in the Faculty of Science at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the base of his research and teaching. He was pro-rector of the Hebrew University in the 70s. He also founded, in 1949, the laboratory for the study of fish disease in Kibutz Nir David, in close collaboration with his lifelong friend and colleague Shmuel Sarig. In 1964 he chaired a national committee recommending the establishment of a Marine Research Laboratory in Eilat, Israel. This also led to the establishment of \"The Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research Corporation\" in 1966. Moshe Shilo was born in Moscow, and immigrated to Israel in 1933, after spending a decade in Zopot (near Danzig), which was at that time under German jurisdiction. He was an undergraduate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He carried out his M.Sc. studies with Manfred Ashner on the ecology of marine luminescent bacteria, and his Ph.D. (1947) with Aryeh Leo Olitzki on heat labile antigens of Shigella. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war he served in the siege of Jerusalem in the Intelligence unit of the Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah, and in the Science corps. He did post doctoral studies with Sir Hans Krebs at Oxford, and Roger Stanier at UC Berkeley (1954–1956). During his entire scientific career he was a faculty member of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and published over 100 articles in leading scientific journals. Throughout his career he maintained close personal and professional relations with his childhood friend Alexander Keynan, who was also a professor at the Hebrew University. Moshe Shilo married Miriam Goldzweig in 1948, and they subsequently worked together for over two decades on the analysis of Prymnesium toxin. They have two daughters and a son."

The son of Stan and Jan Berenstain, he continues the Berenstain Bears series of picture books that his parents inaugurated in 1962. Berenstain was born in Philadelphia. He studied at Philadelphia College of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. His earliest work in the U.S. Library of Congress catalog was published in 1976: K'tonton on an Island in the Sea by Sadie Rose Weilerstein, which he illustrated as Michael Berenstain (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America). The third K'tonton book, it features \"Adventures of a thumb-sized Jewish boy who must fend for himself when stranded on an island.\" During the next three years he wrote and illustrated four instructive picture books published by David McKay, The Castle Book and sequels on ships, armor, and lighthouses. He first collaborated with his parents by illustrating two picture books, The Day of the Dinosaur and After the Dinosaurs (Random House, 1987 and 1988), after which he did several dinosaur books himself. He is credited as a creator of his family's bear family beginning in 1995 as illustrator of the Bear Scouts subseries. Mike continued the Berenstain Bears with his mother following Stan's death in 2005, and took over creation of the series after Jan's death in 2012. His older brother Leo Berenstain is involved in management of the franchise. Berenstain's father was a secular Jew, and his mother was an Episcopalian. He and his brother were raised in a secular household. Berenstain began investigating Christianity after he married and sent his children to Quaker schools. He was baptized in a Presbyterian church and eventually partnered with Zondervan, an evangelical Christian publishing company, to produce religiously-themed Berenstain Bears books."

  "text" : "Mariano Pajetta (January 6, 1851 in Serravalle, near Vittorio Veneto – March 3, 1923 in Verona) was an Italian painter, mainly of genre and landscape scenes. He was well known for his decorative wall frescoes. His father Paolo was a landscape artist. His brother, Pietro Pajetta, was also a painter. He was a resident of Serravalle. Self-taught, he has sent many works to exhibitions, including in 1881 to Venice: Acrobati and Effetti del gioco; to the 1883 Promotrice: Al pascolo; to the 1883 Exhibition at Milan: Vita campestre, All'abbeveratoio, and In posa. The latter two were also displayed in 1883 at Rome. In 1884 at Turin, he sent: Stalla con animali, belonging to Paolo Gambierasi, and Et nunc et semper. He resided in Genoa, where he became known for his decorative wall frescoes, though he did not abandon his easel works, painting Al mercato nel Veneto, displayed in 1886 at Genoa. He returned to live in the Veneto, and by 1910 had settled in Verona, and dedicated himself to painting atop of photographs, collaborating with the studios of Moro in Venice, and Bressanini in Verona."

  "text" : "Mehmet Baransu (born 1977) is a Turkish journalist and author of Kurdish origin. He is a correspondent for Taraf, and previously worked for Aksiyon (1997–2000). He is the winner of a 2009 Sedat Simavi Journalism Award. Known for investigating the Turkish military, he reported on the \"Cage Action Plan\" which became part of the Ergenekon trials, and published documents in January 2010 revealing “Balyoz” (\"Sledgehammer\"), a plan for a coup that was hatched by Turkish military officers in 2003. In January 2010, in connection with Sledgehammer, Baransu delivered a suitcase to the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office a suitcase containing evidence of the coup plot such as CDs, tapes, printed documents, and handwritten notes. The Sledgehammer plot involved plans to bomb two mosques in Istanbul, attack a military museum and blame it on religious extremists, and attack a Turkish plane and blame it on Greece. Three hundred and thirty-one of the 365 suspects were sentenced to prison on Sept. 21, 2012, while the remaining 34 were acquitted. Three retired generals were sentenced to life in prison on charges of “attempting to overthrow the government by force,” but their terms were later reduced to 20 years. Turkey’s Constitutional Court ruled in June 2014 that the rights of most of the convicted suspects had been violated, and ordered the immediate release of 236 of them. The rest were released later. A new trial began on Nov. 3, 2014. Reports released in December 2014 and February 2015 claimed that some of the evidence in the case was fabricated. In 2010 it was revealed that the phones of both Baransu and his wife, Esra Baransu, had been tapped by the Turkish Gendarmerie on false pretences. The Gendarmerie had obtained warrants for the phone taps by falsely representing the IMEI code numbers of the Baransus' phones as belonging to fictional Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) suspects. In 2011 five military officers were each sentenced to five years in jail for these actions. In 2011 a voice recording posted online, allegedly by a military official, said that Baransu should be killed as a warning to others. His books include Mösyö: Hanefi Avcı’nın Yazamadıkları (2010), which alleges that former police chief Hanefi Avcı had committed torture and developed connections with the Devrimci Karargâh group, and that Avcı had published his book on Ergenekon to try to ward off arrest. His 2012 book Pirus alleged plans to assassinate Chief of the General Staff Hilmi Özkök in order to permit a 2004 coup, and suggested that the plans were foiled when US officials found out about them."

  "text" : "Mahmoud Badr (Arabic: محمود بدر‎‎; born 1985) is an Egyptian activist and journalist. He co-founded the Tamarod (\"Rebel\") movement and serves as its official spokesman and one of its principal leaders. Tamarod claimed to have gathered millions of signatures, that were never independently verified, demanding the resignation of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, and organized mass protests which preceded the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état removing Morsi from power. Recent audio tapes secretly recorded in the offices of the deputy ministers to Al-Sisi - and authenticated by independent expert analysis from France - establish the movement as an arm of the military coup. Senior officials of the coup are heard on the tapes bragging about how good they were at falsifying evidence against Morsi, at forgery and at torture. The list of plotters included Deputy Defense Minister Mamdouh Shaheen and Gen. Abbas Kamel, the chief of staff to Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the top military commander regarded as the mastermind behind the coup. Badr has a career in journalism and broadcast media production. He began his political activism during the presidency of Hosni Mubarak, serving as a coordinator of the grassroots opposition movement, Kefaya (\"Enough\"), which was founded in 2004. He was also a member of the opposition National Association for Change (NAC) headed by Mohamed ElBaradei. Mubarak was overthrown during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Prior to 2013, Badr was not among the prominent figures in the revolutionary movement."

He wished to make Tigani (now Pythagorio) the capital of the Principality of Samos; he created a port there and reordered the street layout of the town. The Samian Parliament donated some fertile land called 'Aristarches' in his honour in Kokkari to express its gratitude. His rule, fair in the beginning, ended up strict and cruel. He changed the taxation system and made enemies out of his friends. Mitilinii even rebelled against him and the Ottoman army was used to suppress the rebellion, against the rights and privileges of the Principality and its inhabitants. He was overthrown by a popular uprising in 1866."

  "text" : "Marion Edwena Kenworthy, M.D. (1891-1980), an American psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, introduced psychiatric and psychoanalytic concepts to the education of social workers and to the field of social work. She was born in Hampden, Massachusetts. She entered Tufts Medical School in 1908 at the age of 17, and graduated cum laude with a medical degree in 1913. She accepted an appointment at the Gardner State Hospital in Massachusetts, the first woman ever on the hospital medical staff. After three years, she moved to the Foxboro State Hospital in Massachusetts. Her weekends and vacations were spent at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital (now the Massachusetts Mental Health Center), where she came into contact with Elmer Southard, a leading child psychiatrist. Among her colleagues were Karl Menninger, Harry Solomon, and Lawson Lowrey, leaders in the field of psychiatry. Kenworthy moved to New York in 1919 to educate physical education teachers at the Central School of Hygiene of the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA). She also worked on a research project at the Vanderbilt Clinic and the New York State Neurological Institute observing glandular problems of children. Here, she met Bernard Glueck who invited her to lecture at the New York School of Social Work (now the Columbia University School of Social Work). In 1921, she became assistant director of the Bureau of Child Guidance under Glueck. When he left in 1924, she assumed the directorship. The Bureau had been established as a demonstration clinic for the mental health problems of children. During her tenure, Kenworthy trained in psychoanalysis with Otto Rank. Kenworthy established her private practice in child and adult psychiatry. The Bureau closed in 1927. Kenworthy was named an instructor in the Department of Mental Hygiene at the New York Social Work School in 1921. She became its director in 1924 and stayed until 1940, when she became professor of psychiatry. In 1956, she retired and awarded Emeritus status. A Chair was established in her honor and she was named a Trustee to the Board of Columbia University. In 1968, the Medical College of Pennsylvania awarded her an honorary D.M.S., and in 1973 she received an honorary D.S. from Columbia University. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) gave her its Agnes McGavin Purcell Award in 1971. Kenworthy achieved a number of “firsts.” She was the first elected woman vice president of the American Psychiatric Association (1965-1966), the first woman president of the American Psychoanalytic Society (1958-1959), president of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry (1959-1961), and president of the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (1959-1961). Kenworthy contributed to the education of thousands of social workers and helped to professionalize the profession. She fostered child psychiatry as a specialization. She worked to integrate mental health concepts into the juvenile court system and adoption sources in New York City."

Kishk wrote for the weeklies Akhbar al-Yawm and Ruz al-Yusuf and the periodical al-Risala until 1965. According to the Middle East Record, Kishk's \"anti-leftist stand\" may have led to his being \"prevented from continuing his career in journalism\". But actually it was his anti-Nasser writings that led to his removal from these journals and eventual exile to Beirut, Lebanon in 1968. Kishk gained some notoriety for his ideas concerning gender and sexuality in Islam.) In his book A Muslim's Thoughts about the Sexual Question, (1984), which was initially banned in Egypt, he examined contemporary Western scholarship about Christianity and Islam in relation to sex, with special attention to homosexuality. Kishk was concerned with the danger of \"the enemies of Islam and ... our civilization [having] the opportunity to publish their ideas and plant their poisons in the minds and hearts of our Muslim youth, who no longer follow an Islamic conduct nor are directed by Islamic thought.\" While Kishk disapproved of sexual relations between same sex couples, he noted that there was no prescribed punishment for it in Islam. He also analyzed those parts of the Quran that described Jannah(heaven/paradise) and concluded that \"sex with youthful boys will be the reward for Muslim men who control their desires in this world by not practicing sodomy.\""

He was the only son of Matthias Attwood (1779-1851), sometime member of parliament for Whitehaven and his wife Susannah née Twells, and was descended from the Attwood family of Wolverley Court, Worcestershire. He first entered politics at the 1835 general election when he stood unsuccessfully at Greenwich. At the next election in 1837 he was elected to the Commons as one of two members of parliament for Greenwich, alongside the Liberal, Edward George Barnard. At the next general election in which took place in June and July 1841 he chose not to stand at Greenwich again, instead contesting in turn the City of London and Kinsale without success. He subsequently contested a by-election at Sunderland in September 1841. The election was marked by riots, and Attwood was defeated by his Liberal opponent, Viscount Howick. In 1851 he inherited his father's residences at Gracechurch Street in the City of London and Dulwich Hill House. He also inherited his business interests and shares, becoming a partner in the banking firm of Spooner, Attwoods and Company and chairman of the General Steam Navigation Company. In 1863 the bank was sold to Barclay, Bevan, Tritton and Company. In the following year he was asked by the City of London Conservative Registration Association to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming election, but he declined due to ill health. He died, unmarried, at his Dulwich home, aged 57."

  "text" : "M. Magendran (born Magendran M. Munisamy on 6 December 1963 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) is the first Malaysian mountain climber and first Tamil to conquer the summit of Mount Everest. Magendran's party ascended the South Col on the southeast ridge. He stepped onto Everest's summit on 23 May 1997, at 11:55 a.m. local time. He was followed by N. Mohanadas (Mohanadas Nagappan), who reached the summit a few minutes later at 12:10 p.m. The two mountaineers were part of the first \"Malaysia-Everest Project 97\" jointly organised by the Malaysia Mountaineering Association and the Ministry of Youth and Sports of Malaysia. Also with their team of ten people was M. Moorthy (Moorthy Maniam), a Malaysian of Indian descent. Mount Everest is the world's highest mountain, with a peak at 8,848 metres (29,029 ft) above sea level. Its summit was first achieved in 1953 after numerous failed attempts that began in 1921. The first person to finally set foot on its summit was New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary, who was accompanied by Tenzing Norgay of Nepal. Both M. Magendran and N. Mohanadas were conferred Datukships by the Penang state government in 2010 for their Himalayan achievement. Both men were also conferred the Federal 'Datukships' title by the King of Malaysia in Jun 2011 In June 2013, Datuk Magendran, who is considered a pioneer among Malaysians, gave advice for those mountain climbers who would brave the hazards of the world's highest peak: ALL safety and preparatory efforts must be taken before setting out on a mountain climb, especially when it involves the world's tallest mountain. One should be very well prepared and must have undergone rigorous physical and mental training before taking on the mammoth peak, [...] One must undergo sufficient training and preparation, which includes endurance training and altitude training. I had been involved in outdoor activities such as mountain climbing and jungle-trekking for ten years and received almost three years of rigorous training before our team left for Mount Everest in 1997. Magendran urged future climbers and trekkers not to overlook their health before and during the climb, adding that any symptom that was overlooked could be fatal. He also reminded, \"Trekkers should keep an eye on the health of their teammates, too.\" The year 1997 also commemorated the 40th anniversary of Malaysian independence. In 2000, both M. Magendran and N. Mohanadas were pictured on their nation's postage stamps."

His earliest works were painted for Akbar, and then later he was in the service of Akbar's son and successor Jahangir. Manohar's works frequently depicted the royal families and life at court. Some of his works can be found at the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum."

  "text" : "Mirza Gul Muhammad Natiq Makrani (c. 1778-1848) was born in a Baloch family of Mullazai tribe at Tasp, Panjgur. His date of birth is not confirmed but most sources agree on somewhere around 1778. His father's name was Noor Muhammad Mullazai. He also had a brother named Nabi Bux. According to local sources, he got his primary education in his home town. In his early age he traveled to Isfahan, Iran for higher education. There he studied for many years and came back with a command of Persian language and literature. Local people start calling him Gul Muhammad Paarsi-waan (meaning specialist of Persian language or Persian reader) because of his knowledge of the Persian language and literature. He spent only a few years at his home town of Tasp. He did not get married. Then he left for Sindh in the court of Talpur Baloch. He severed all of his communications with his family and only wrote two letters from there according to the family sources. He left Sind for Lahore sometime around 1830. He stayed in Lahore for two years and then left for Delhi around 1833. At that time Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib, a famous Urdu and Persian poet was in his height. He give his Farsi deewan (collection) to Gul Muhammad for review where he makes the famous correction of (panja e khook). Ghalib in one of his Persian odes said on the unfaithfulness of a wife that \"Khook shud panja zadan saaz kard\" (become a sow, started scratching the claws) and Natiq Makkurani said: \"Ghalib: khook srumb darad, panja nadarad\" (Ghalib: sow got toes, not claws). Then Ghalib's reply initiates with these words: \"Ba soo-e Natiq-e-rangen-bayan, az taraf e Ghalib-e-Harza-Sara\" (To: Natiq the vibrant-narrator, From: Ghalib the blasphemer). He stayed in Delhi for three years. In 1836, he went to Lucknow. He never returned to Delhi again. He enjoyed great favour from the ruler Asif Ud Doula of Lucknow. It is believed that he wrote many books but none of them have been found. His poetry was collected by his pupils in a book, Johar-e-Muazzam, which is currently out of print. He died in Lucknow in 1848 and was buried there. His brother Nabi Bux's descendants are still living in Tasp Panjgoor."

Michael had two sons, Leustachius, ancestor of the Zagyvafői family, and Falkos, the first member of the Falkos branch and grandfather of Thomas Szécsényi. Michael served as voivode of Transylvania between 1209 and 1212. Besides that he was also ispán (comes) of Bihar County in 1209. Michael was the first voivode to receive a land grant in the province of Transylvania, around 1210. However, these originally uninhabited lands along the upper courses of the river Maros (Mureș) were confiscated in 1228. He was appointed ban of Slavonia in 1212, alongside his brother. Simon, along with Peter, son of Töre, played a decisive role in the murder of Queen Gertrude of Merania in 1213. Michael probably also took part in the preparation of the assassination. After the return of Andrew II of Hungary from Halychina, only Peter was executed by impalement, the Kacsics clan could retain their estates yet. The land confiscation in 1228 might be a sign of the subsequent retaliation."

  "text" : "Marcelle Mercenier (1920 – 13 March 1996) was a Belgian pianist and teacher. Mercenier was known as an influential pedagogue in Brussels, then in Liège. She was a fervent advocate of contemporary music, but also performed Chopin under the baton of Charles Munch and Poulenc with the composer (). She was a member of the group \"Séminaire des Arts\" created in August 1944 in Brussels. In the concert series of this group, on 28 February 1947 she premiered, together with the flautist Herlin Van Boterdael, the Sonatina for flute and piano by Pierre Boulez, a work that had been composed a year earlier for Jean-Pierre Rampal, but had not been performed by him (, 54). The Sonatine was the second work in which Boulez used serial technique, after the Notations for piano of 1945 (). She also gave the first Belgian performance of the final version of Boulez's Third Piano Sonata and premiered works by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Henri Pousseur, and Philippe Boesmans."

  "text" : "Mehmet Ali Yaprak, (born 1949, Nizip, died 4 January 2004) was a Turkish businessman and drug trafficker, who was involved in the Susurluk scandal. He died in Kartal Prison in January 2004 after falling into a diabetic coma. Yaprak was kidnapped on 25 April 1996 and released a week later. He was a major figure in the captagon trade. Yaprak was ostensibly a businessman with a television channel (Yaprak TV), a radio station, and a tourism company (Hidayet Turizm). However, he also led a feared gang that smuggled Captagon via Syria and Saudi Arabia, according to the Susurluk scandal MİT report. His tourism company facilitated the trafficking. The report says that Yaprak donated 500 billion Lira to support Mehmet Ağar's electoral campaign. Upon learning of Yaprak's wealth, Abdullah Çatlı and a team of 6–7 dressed in police uniform kidnapped Yaprak on 25 May 1996 and took him to a house in Siverek belonging to the Bucak clan. The kidnapping, motivated by the desire to know where the Captagon was coming from and cut Topal out of the loop, was directed by police in Ankara. Yaprak paid 10 million DM in ransom, however Çatlı and his fellow kidnappers received only a small portion of this. When they found out that they had been cheated, they fell out with their overlords in Ankara. They then kidnapped Yaprak a second time and interrogated him, sending one copy of the interrogation tape to Bucak and another to Eymür through MİT agent Müfit Sement. Leveraging the tapes, Çatlı worked out an agreement with Ankara. Yaprak was convicted in 1997 for involvement in the assassination of Gaziantep Bar lawyer Burhan Veli Torun, and released due to an amnesty law (Turkish: Şartlı Salıverilme Yasası). In 2002, he was re-imprisoned after being caught with 5 million pills of Captagon. He died in prison, January 2004."

  "text" : "Modesto Parlatore (Orsogna, Province of Chieti, March 5, 1849 – March 6, 1912) was an Italian sculptor and architect. In 1870, Parlatore was awarded a stipend from the city of Orsogna to study in Rome, and enrolled in the Institute of Fine Arts under the professor Tito Angelini. There he dedicated himself to sculpture and architecture. In Rome, he was encouraged by the painter Annibale Angelini. He exhibied in his early years a Bust of a widow, Bust of Old Man, a bronze Bust of King Umberto, and one of General Garibaldi. In 1877, he was awarded first prize for a work in the Exposition at Geneva, Switzerland. He completed designs, never built, for a Monument to the Hero of Caprera' (Garibaldi), to be erected in Chieti, and for a Monument to a Quintino Sella. His Ad comilia was built depicting a young masculine ancient Roman citizen. He worked as an architect in many restorations, and served on may commission to examine designs of monuments, including the commission to evaluate a monument to Vittorio Emanuele II that was erected in Spoleto. However, when he complained of possible corruption in the selection process, he was shunned from official commissions in Rome. In the 21st century, a series of works and models by Parlatore donated to his province were gathered in an annex to the Museo Orsognese Arte Musica, located in the Torre Di Bene in Orsogna. Among the sculptures are four lif-size stucco statues: La Sorpresa, Il Ravvedimento, Il Fromboliere, and Vir Plebeus Ad Forum; a stucco bas-relief depicting San Rocco tra gli appestati; a heraldic shield of the town of Guardiagrele; and ten half-busts in bronze, stucco, and terracotta. Parlatore sculpted a plaque dedicated to the Italian soldiers fallen during the 19th century subjugation of Ethiopia (Monument to Caduti di Saati e Dogali, 1887) located near the church of Santa Chiara of Lanciano, located where there previously were barracks for a contingent that had died in the conflict."

It consists of 10 essays about topics from the state of the womb before and after conception, to the effect of music on nerves. She depicted the pregnant woman as a cluster of symptoms to be managed, particularly with regard to her psychological state. Mears subscribed to the common notion that \"irritability\" of the pregnant woman’s uterus induced a heightened \"sensibility\". The organization and broad scope of the text mirrored this representation of the body as a bundle of potential pathologies. A contemporary review of her work describes its purpose being to teach women the important advantages of pursuing nature's plans in everything that relates to the pregnant state. Mears' studied the writings of Harvey, Leake, Smellie and Denman."

  "text" : "Max Hoelz (14 October 1889 - 15 September 1933) was a German Communist, most known for his role as a 'Communist Bandit' in the Vogtland region. Hoelz was born the son of a day labourer and emigrated to Britain in 1905 to become a mechanic. Hoelz served in the German army during the World War I but was wounded and worked on the railways. Towards the end of the war he was working in a reinforced concrete construction company near Mulhouse in Alsace where he received news his wife in Vogtland was ill, leading him to travel back to Falkenstein with soldiers returning from the front, amongst whom he helped form the Falkenstein Workers' and Soldiers' Council on 9 November 1918. However, he was shortly forced out of the council by his co-chair Sturl, a USPD member, but despite this he joined the USPD a got a job selling subscription to their new journal for the Vogtland, Vogtlandische Volkszeitung. Hoelz went on to found the local branch of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in Falkenstein in Spring 1919 and became a leader of the unemployed in the town. During the Kapp Putsch Hoelz helped form a Red Army in Vogtland. However the activities of his mobile detachment consisting of sometimes as many as 200 armed men caused dismay to the KPD leaders, and soon Heinrich Brandler of the Chemnitz KPD ensure he was expelled from the party. As the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD) was at that time bringing together former KPD activists who were disillusioned with the moderate politics of the KPD leadership, he soon joined them, finding himself more at home amongst their ranks. In the aftermath of the crushing of the Ruhr Red Army, the Vogtland was surrounded by 50,000 government troops and Hoelz led his army to the border with Czechoslovakia where they were surrounded by the Reichswehr. The Red Army split up into detachments to avoid the Reichsweher and Hoelz was eventually arrested in Czechoslovakia and then deported to Austria. After returning to Vogtland in late 1920, Hoelz organised a band of around 50 men equipped with arms and bicycles to try and free those detained after the Kapp Putsch. The first bombing he organised was of the Falkenstein Rathaus on 6 March 1921 and others targeted courthouses throughout Germany. Later in his 1929 autobiography 'From the \"White Cross\" to the Red Flag' he regretted taking part in this these attacks, \"It was a grave political mistake to endorse, and participate in, the robberies of banks, post offices, etc. by \"expropriation groups.\" The money went to leaders of the KAPD. It fulfilled a political purpose because it was used to print newspapers and leaflets. A small part was used to help the comrades living underground. Unfortunately, the proletarian aid organisation Rote Hilfe did not yet exist. However, the political gain never outweighed the damage done to the communist cause by the expropriations. One reason was that most of the revolutionary communist workers did not understand and condone them. Another reason was that the actions corrupted the comrades involved in them.\""

  "text" : "The Reverend Moses Rintel, S.J.M., (1823 – 9 May 1880) was a Jewish Rabbi in colonial Victoria (Australia) who established the first Beth din (rabbinical court) in the British empire outside London. Rintel was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the time that his father, the late Rev. Rabbi Myer Rintel, was minister of the Hebrew congregation. (His father was a famed Hebrew and Talmudical scholar, and published several works). Moses, holding a Semeecha from the late Chief Rabbi in London, Dr. Solomon Herschel, was the first duly authorised Jewish clergyman to come out to the colony. Rintel arrived in Sydney in 1844, where he established the Sydney Hebrew Academy, of which he became the principal. In 1849 he accepted the office of minister of the newly established Jewish congregation of Melbourne, subject to the approval of the Rev. Chief Rabbi, Dr. Adler, which was soon after obtained. He married, the same year, a Miss Elvina Hart, and had had a family of nine children. Circumstances compelled him to resign his charge following a split in the congregation that led to the formation of the East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, where he was appointed minister. In the year 1864, mainly through his exertions, a duly constituted Beth Din, the only one out of London, was established, of which he acted as the chairman; and in 1868 the Chief Rabbi of Great Britain and its dependencies assigned to him the position and title of Senior Minister of the Melbourne Hebrew community. For many years he took a deep interest in the Melbourne Jewish Philanthropic Society, in which he has not only held all the various offices, but has, on more than one occasion, been elected its president. Through his efforts this society was allowed to participate in the Government grant in aid of charitable institutions, and for which the members voted him a very handsome testimonial. He, with a few others, founded the United Friends' Jewish Benefit Society in 1856, of which he became the first president. His sphere of usefulness was not limited to matters in connection with his own faith; he has been for many years past and still continues to be connected with various societies and institutions. He was one of the founders of the Benevolent Asylum, and acted as Grand Chaplain from 1850. Rintel died in Melbourne on 9 May 1880."

Under Ishaq's leadership, the LeJ claimed responsibility for several mass-casualty attacks largely targeting Pakistan's Shia and Barelvi population, including multiple bombings that killed over 200 Hazara Shias in Quetta in 2013. He was also accused of masterminding the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore in 2009, and the Ashura bombings in Afghanistan in 2011. Ishaq was killed, along with his two sons and deputy Ghulam Rasool Shah, in a police encounter on 29 July 2015, the circumstances of which are disputed. Punjab Home Minister Shuja Khanzada was assassinated in Attock a month later, in an attack claimed by LeJ as retaliation.

His mother, Magdalena Łuczak (27), and her partner, Mariusz Krężołek (33), were found guilty of the murder on 31 July 2013. On 2 August 2013, both Łuczak and Krężołek were jailed for life with a minimum sentence of 30 years each. Daniel Pelka's biological parents, Łuczak and Eryk Pelka, separated in Coventry, and his father moved back to Poland when Daniel was a year old. Łuczak and Krężołek starved the child, beat him, locked him in a room, force-fed him salt, and put his head underwater in the bath. He weighed only one stone nine pounds (10.4 kg) when he died. Doctors described him as what looked like 'a concentration camp victim'. On 14 July 2015, Łuczak was found unresponsive in her cell at about 07:15 BST and was pronounced dead. An inquest held three days later revealed that Luczak had hanged herself one day before what would have been Daniel's eighth birthday. At about 08.30 on 27 January 2016, Krężołek was found dead in his prison cell at Full Sutton Prison. Daniel Pelka's memory is held by many people, including the Facebook page 'Justice For Daniel Pelka'. A group of people on the page will say good morning and good night to the boy and each other, each posting edits with lovely poems and photos of Daniel. The page shares videos and photos made in memory of the child to show respect to him. Every year on his birthday, his death anniversary, Christmas and other special occasions, there is a memorial service for Daniel, held at his memorial at St Paul's Cemetery, Coventry. Many people bring toys, gifts, and cards for the boy to keep his memory alive, and it is frequently cleaned and looked after to keep it looking beautiful."

  "text" : "Matthew Charlton (15 March 1866 – 8 December 1948) was an Australian Labor Party politician. Charlton was born at Linton in rural Victoria but moved to Lambton, New South Wales at the age of five. He worked as a coal miner after only a primary education and then married Martha Rollings in 1889. Charlton had an interest in politics from his early middle age, and joined union strikes against wage reductions in 1896. After a two-year stint in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, Charlton returned to Lambton and rejoined the local colliery workers' union, becoming its treasurer in 1901. He won a by-election for the NSW seat of Waratah in 1903 and transferred to Northumberland in 1904. In 1910 Charlton won the seat of Hunter and rose through the ranks of Andrew Fisher's government, then staying with the Australian Labor Party during its period in opposition. Charlton rose through the ranks to become party leader in 1922. He lost his first election campaign, partly because he was hospitalised with illness during its course. In 1924 Charlton was invited to a meeting of the League of Nations (now United Nations) but was unsuccessful in getting Australia to adopt the Geneva Protocol, established during the meeting. Due to union strikes in 1925, Charlton and his party lost the election held that year and he resigned in 1928. He died on 8 December 1948."

  "text" : "Maurice Bagenal St Leger Keatinge or Keating (c.1761–1835) was an Irish landowner, soldier and politician. He was the son of Maurice Keatinge of Narraghmore, County Kildare, an MP for Kildare in the Parliament of Ireland. Maurice jr. succeeded his father in 1777. He joined the British Army as a cornet in the 3rd Dragoons in 1778 and was successively promoted to lieutenant in the 22nd Dragoons (1779), captain (1781) and then major (1782). He retired to half-pay in 1783, but later resumed his army career and further promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the 85th Foot (1794) and colonel in the 107th Foot (1794) before finally leaving the army in 1796. In 1790 he was elected an MP for County Kildare in the Irish Parliament until the union with Great Britain in 1801, after which he represented County Kildare in the UK Parliament (1801–02). He was appointed High Sheriff of Kildare for 1790–01 and 1793–94. He married in 1790 Lady Martha, the daughter of Anthony Brabazon, 8th Earl of Meath, with whom he had 6 daughters. He built a new mansion on his estate in Kildare which was soon afterwards burnt down by the British army in retaliation for his family's pro-rebel sympathies in the Irish rebellion of 1798. In 1800 he translated Bernal Diaz del Castillo’s La historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España into English as The True History of the Conquest of Mexico. In 1813 he sold his Kildare estate to Robert Latouche for £93,000 and died in Paris in 1835."

  "text" : "Marcel Bovis (1904–1997) was a French photographer, most notable for his photographs of Paris. Bovis studied at the National School of Decorative Arts in Nice and subsequently arrived to Paris to work as decorator. He self-taught photography and started to produce photos of Paris, predominantly at night, since 1927, and after 1936, he became a professional photographer. In the same year, he had the first personal exhibition in Paris. This particular exhibition, which was held in Pavillon de Marsan, was a collection of photos he took together with Pierre Mac Orlan. It records the celebrations of festivals and famous circuses with a humanist sympathy. In 1946 he became one of the founding members of the Le Groupe des XV, an association of French photographers, and in 1952, he exhibited at the World Exhibition of Photography in Lucerne."

  "text" : "Mary Elizabeth Banning (1822-1903) was an American mycologist and botanical illustrator from Maryland. She formally described 23 previously unknown species of fungi, publishing their type descriptions in the Botanical Gazette and Charles Peck's \"Annual Report of the New York State Botanist\". She is best known as the author of The Fungi of Maryland, an unpublished manuscript containing scientific descriptions, mycological anecdotes, and 174 13\" by 15\" watercolor paintings of fungal species. The New York State Museum describes these paintings as \"extraordinary...a blend of science and folk art, scientifically accurate and lovely to look at.\" Banning's manuscript took twenty years to complete (1868-1888). Although the Maryland State Archives, citing Stegman, asserts that \"At this point in time, no one had written a book on American fungi,\" and Haines states, \"In 1868 there were no books from which to learn about American fungi,\" neither assertion is technically correct: Schweinitz's Synopsis Fungorum Carolinæ Superioris was published in 1822. Nevertheless, had Banning's opus been published, it would certainly have been the first illustrated and popularly accessible fungal flora of the southern United States. She was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 1994."

Madison Post was mayor from February 10, 1858 until February 12, 1859. Post was born in New Jersey and moved to Tampa in 1849, a year after the great hurricane of 1848 destroyed much of Tampa. He worked as the manager of the Tampa Hotel and eventually purchased a general store on Lafayette Street (now Kennedy Boulevard). Post was a member of the \"Know-Nothings\" and a supporter of slavery. Post was also anti-immigration and anti-Catholic in his politics. He was appointed as Receiver of Public Moneys for Hillsborough County in 1854. He joined Dr. Darwin Branch and Edward Clarke as delegates to the American Party's Presidential Convention which nominated former President Millard Fillmore. Post and the council increased license fees and established new ordinances to re-establish Tampa's finances. Post enlisted as a private in the Confederate Infantry during the U.S. Civil War and served as a Confederate Deputy Marshall in Florida and as a tax assessor for Florida's Confederate government. Madison Post died in Tampa on September 10, 1867."

  "text" : "Melbourne MacDowell (November 22, 1856 – February 18, 1941) was an American stage and screen actor. He began on the legitimate stage in the 1870s and first appeared on the silent screen in 1917. He was born Willet Melbourne MacDowell in Little Washington, New Jersey (now South River, New Jersey). He had an older brother named E. A. MacDowell. As a teen Melbourne went to sea in the Merchant Marines eventually becoming a mate. Back in the US he had his first acting experience in Montreal at a theatre where he was a ticket seller, assistant doorkeeper and where his brother was employed as an actor. MacDowell was occasionally asked upon to act. Here in Montreal he got a chance to act with Adelaide Neilson, a legend in her short life, in the Shakespeare play As You Like It. Neilson played one of the main characters Rosalind and MacDowell was briefly on as Charles the wrestler. By 1877 MacDowell made his first professional acting appearance in the United States at the Boston Museum where his brother E.A. was an actor. In 1888 MacDowell became acquainted with Fanny Davenport playing in La Tosca with her. In 1889 the two married. He would continue to act with her in her series of emotional plays until her death in 1898. After Davenport died MacDowell became associated professionally with her successor, Blanche Walsh, who continued playing Davenport's famous and emotional roles. A large man weighing over 200 pounds, MacDowell played the hero or distinct character in plays."

  "text" : "Mario Dubsky (1939 - 1985) was an artist born in London to Viennese Jewish parents who had converted to Christianity. Accepted at the Slade School of Fine Art at the unusually young age of 17, Dubsky's early work was influenced by the work of the Anglo-Jewish artist David Bomberg, a Slade School alumnus of 40 years earlier.  He purchased early works from Bomberg's widow which he kept all his life. Several tutors were important and lasting influences including Robert Medley and Keith Vaughan, the latter becoming a close friend. Dubsky was included in the New Generation show at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1966 and 1968. Awarded a Harkness Fellowship he traveled to New York, where he lived from 1969 until 1971 In New York, Dubsky and John Button co-created a large mural in paint and collage at the then-headquarters of the Gay Activists Alliance. The mural was lost in the arson attack that destroyed the building. In the late 1960s, Dubsky developed a more abstract colour field manner of painting with figuration, as in the large-scale Laocconese of 1968 at University College London named after the classical sculpture, the Laocoon. From the 1970s, Dubsky liked to sketched prehistoric bone and skeleton forms at the Natural History Museum and returned to expressionist figuration. His last solo exhibition X Factor at South London Gallery in 1983 contained Cabaret Valhalla now held by the Tate Gallery. His poems and illustrations in Tom Pilgrim's Progress Among The Consequences of Christianity, London, 1981. with an introduction by Edward Lucie-Smith, was claimed by the artist, who was an atheist, as his angry response to the 1977 Blasphemy Trial of Gay News. The inside covers reproduce the Gay Alliance mural made with Button and figures within explicitly engage with Crucifixes and resemble monk-like characters. Dubsky died on 4 August 1985 following a period of illness caused by HIV infection shortly after winning the Tolly Cobbold Drawing Prize with 'Roma II'. He is buried with a humanist service in the eastern section of Highgate Cemetery alongside the main west path. His twin sister Barbara helped ensure a number of posthumous exhibitions and Dubsky's work is held in a number of public collections."

Bibbins' second book of poetry, The Dance of No Hard Feelings (Copper Canyon Press, 2009) “takes much of its subject matter and its attitude from life in George W. Bush’s America … These poems are made powerful by the bitter energy of a voice not silenced but made to sound ridiculous in a political culture in which disagreement with the government is unpatriotic.” His most recent book of poetry, They Don’t Kill You Because They’re Hungry, They Kill You Because They’re Full (Copper Canyon Press, 2014) is a thorny spirited examination of power, sexuality and gender. Bibbins currently teaches in the graduate writing programs at The New School, where he co-founded LIT magazine, and Columbia University. He lives in New York."

  "text" : "Dwayne Jones was a Jamaican 16-year-old who was killed by a violent mob in Montego Bay in 2013, after he attended a dance party dressed in women's clothing. The incident attracted national and international media attention and brought increased scrutiny to the status of LGBT rights in Jamaica. Perceived as effeminate, Jones was bullied in school and, at the age of 14, was forced out of his family home by his father. He moved into a derelict house in Montego Bay with transgender friends. On the evening of 21 July 2013, they went to the Irwin area of the city and attended a dance party. When some men at the party discovered that the cross-dressing Jones was not a woman, they confronted and attacked him. Jones was beaten, stabbed, shot, and run over by a car; he died in the early hours of the morning. Police investigated the murder but did not arrest or charge anyone for the crime, which remains unsolved. The event made newspaper headlines in Jamaica and was reported on in the United Kingdom and the United States. While voices on social media accused Jones of provoking his killers by cross-dressing in public, the murder was condemned by Jamaican educators and the country's Justice Minister. In the wake of the attack, both domestic and international organisations devoted to LGBT rights and human rights – among them Human Rights Watch, Jamaicans for Justice, and the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays – asked the Jamaican authorities for a proper investigation and for legal recognition of LGBT rights on the island."

This book was translated into English by Gregory H. Maddox and published in 1995 as The Gogo: History, Customs, and Traditions. Mathias E. Mnyampala was working as a Tax Clerk for the Native Treasury in Dodoma during the colonial rule. He was intended to travel the whole Ugogo region in order to collect the tax and establish a census of the populations and their belongings. This is why he entered into contact with the Watemi, the gogo traditional Kings and Rainmakers, who allowed him to write this historical book by giving him the oral sources of his ten years long work. The author was pioneering in Kiswahili in the early 1940s the ethno-history trend and in the same time was a faithful messenger for special correspondences between the then Freedom Fighters Movement called Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) and the Watemi. After the Independence of Tanganyika in 1961, Mathias E. Mnyampala continued his administrative career in the Judicial system as a Magistrate. His former pro-TANU sympathies and his literary talent allowed him to become the national chairman of the association of Kiswahili poets called Usanifu wa Kiswahili na Ushairi Tanzania (UKUTA). This association was in charge to promote the diffusion of Kiswahili, the official language of the new Tanzanian Nation, by teaching to the Tanzanian masses the classical forms of Kiswahili poetry and their conservative transformations."

  "text" : "Mohammed Fadel (name also spelled Muhammad Fadil) is a veteran Egyptian television and film director. Fadel, along with Osama Anwar Okasha and Inaam Mohamed Ali, is credited in Egypt for establishing the genre of Egyptian dramatic serial television. He is considered a \"godfather\" of Egyptian television serials. Fadel began his career in the 1950s in radio. He wrote a number of television series in the 1960s and 1970s, the most notable of which was the comedic soap opera Al-Qahira wa-l-nas (\"Cairo and the People\"), which was themed on modernity and cultural authenticity. Divided into half-hour segments, the show was similar to American sitcom television, making it unique in Egyptian media during its time. He also directed the Ramadan soap operas Abna'i Al-A'izza', Shukran (\"Dear Children, Thank You\") in the late 1970s, Rihlat El-Sayyid Abul-Ela El-Bishri (\"The Journey of Mr Abul-Ela El-Bishri\") in the 1980s, Li Dawa'i Amniya (\"For Security Measures\") in 2005, and Sekket el-Hilali (\"El-Hilali's Path\") in 2006. His reputation was significantly raised with his television series \"White Flag\" (1989), written by Okasha. The show was set in Alexandria and dealt with Egypt's wide income disparity, criminals-turned-wealthy and Egyptian high life. Fadel directed the 1982 romance film Hobb fil Zinzana (\"Love in the Prison Cell\") starring Soad Hosny, the first films on Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser in Nasser 56 (1996) starring Ahmed Zaki, and Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum in the 1999 film Kawkab al-Sharq (\"Star of the Orient\"). The latter starred Fadel's wife, veteran actress Ferdous Abdel-Hamid."

  "text" : "Muirgel was a brave Irish woman who helped her country get rid of a powerful enemy. She killed one of their chieftains in 882 AD. Muirgel was born to an important leader in Northern Ireland, Maelechlainn. According to the Chronicum Scotorum, she slayed the son of Ausli with the help of Otir, son of Eirgni. The son of Ausli was an important chieftain of the long time enemy Vikings. Later historians recalled this act and similar ones as a display by woman of \"loyalty of kith, kin and country.” Though the majority of sources point to Muirgel’s story as unfolding with the slaying of the foreign chieftain, a few sources point to a slightly different version of her life. It is reported that Muirgel may have married Iarnkne in order to create an alliance amongst the two peoples. This version of her story is further expanded on in The Mystery of the Angels and Bloody Sunday: The Story of the 1920 Irish Rebellion, both fiction novels by Joseph Murphy."

Nonetheless, tensions developed between Saad and the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1970s as they competed for influence in Sidon. Saad's assassination sparked the Lebanese Civil War, and he is considered by many historians the conflict's first casualty."

He co-wrote the party's document The Green Budget, published in 1991. At the 1992 general election, Baker stood in Sheffield Hallam; he took less than 1% of the vote, and was not elected. During this period, he became the leading opponent of the Green 2000 campaign to change the party constitution. In August, he welcomed the resignation of Principal Speaker Sara Parkin, the leader of Green 2000 proposals. Following this, Baker was elected as Principal Speaker, serving for a year. Soon after completing his term as Principal Speaker, Baker resigned from the Green Party and joined the Liberal Democrats. He became the editor of Challenge, the journal of the Green Liberal Democrats group. He subsequently devoted his time to campaigning on corporate social responsibility, leading the Business in the Community charity, and subsequently his own Daisywheel Interactive agency, while writing for Ethical Corporation."

One of Bryennios's students was Theodore Metochites, the grand logothete during the reign of Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1272–1328). Metochites studied astronomy under Bryennios. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project of North Dakota State University, he is the scholarly ancestor with the most known academic descendants (i.e., 128,446), all through his student Theodore Metochites."

They returned to Warsaw in January 1940 and in November the same year they joined the fate of other Jewish citizens of Warsaw in the ghetto. In the ghetto Mira worked in a small tailor's shop together with her friends Towa Frenkel and Rachel Zilberberg. In 1942 she visited other ghettos as a courier. During the Ghetto Uprising she fought in the so-called central ghetto. On the 8th of May 1943 she was in a bunker at 18 Mila Street together with Mordechai Anielewicz and a group of about 120 fighters. When the bunker was discovered and surrounded by the Germans the fighters refused to surrender. The majority committed suicide at Arie Wilner's command."

  "text" : "Maximilian (Max) Westermaier (6 May 1852, Kaufbeuren – 1 May 1903, Fribourg) was a German botanist. He studied sciences at the University of Munich, where he was influenced by botanists Ludwig Radlkofer and Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli. After graduation, he worked as an assistant to Simon Schwendener in Berlin, becoming privat-docent in 1879. In 1887 he relocated to Königsberg as a temporary replacement for the late Robert Caspary (1818-1887). Beginning in 1890, he taught classes at the gymnasium in Freising, Bavaria. In 1896, with the support of Pope Leo XIII, he became the first professor of botany at the University of Fribourg, a position he maintained until his death in 1903. In 1898-99, he participated in a scientific expedition to Java, publishing \"Zur Entwickelung und Struktur einiger Pteridophyten aus Java\" (Development and structure of some pteridophytes of Java, 1900) as a result of his research. In 1893 he published \"Kompendium der allgemeinen Botanik für Hochschulen\", a book that was later translated into English and published in 1896 as \"A compendium of general botany\". Other noted works by Westermaier are \"Zur Embryologie der Phanerogamen, insbesondere über die sogenannten Antipoden\" (The embryology of phanerogams, particularly in the so-called Antipodes, 1890). and \"Ueber gelenkartige einrichtungen an stammorganen\" (1901). The standard author abbreviation Westerm. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

Following the 2009 Honduran coup d'etat, that ousted Zelaya, Dabdoub declared that she had not been a 'cuartista' (i.e. a supporter of the referendum on constitutional reform) but opposed the coup. Dabdoub was elected to the National Congress of Honduras in the 2009 general election as a Liberal candidate in Atlantida. With 30,234 votes (30.7% of the valid votes), she was the most voted Liberal candidate in the constituency. In the Liberal Party primaries (held in 2008), she had finished in second place in Atlantida with 12,603 votes (6.94%). She was a candidate of the Elvinist Liberal Movement (the platform of presidential candidate Elvin Santos). In May 2013 Dabdoub declared her intent to contest the La Ceiba mayoral post once again, in the primaries of the Libre party. Dabdoub was nominated as the candidate of the June 28 Movement of Liberals in Resistance (one of the internal currents of Libre). Dabdoub emerged victorious, obtaining 5,364 votes (56.43%), becoming the mayoral candidate of Libre in La Ceiba in the 2013 general election. Dadboub is the president of a charity named after her, Fundación Margie."

She was also an authority on local ethnobotany, and on the usage of the temazcal sweat bath. Her traditional wool weavings on the backstrap loom were well known within the state of Morelos, and received many prizes. As a child, as was common in that period, she was punished for speaking her native Nahuatl language in school, but she kept speaking it and eventually became a translator helping other speakers access their rights in the legal system of the state of Morelos. She is cited as a source of linguistic data in several articles about the variety of Nahuatl spoken in Hueyapan, Morelos. She was trained as a nurse and was responsible for much of the medical treatment of the inhabitants of Hueyapan administering injections, treating wounds and delivering babies in her home, until the construction of an official clinic. In 1977, with the anthropologist Laurencia Alvarez, she published an account of her own experience with the folk-illness susto, which has come to be frequently cited within the literature on this illness."

He found out that violence and homicide are declining in Europe. His research has highlighted the ways in which cultural models of conduct of life, embedded in social institutions, have shaped patterns of daily behaviour among adolescent and young adult men, which in turn influenced the likelihood of frictions leading to aggressive behaviour. He is also recognized for his studies on the developmental causes of crime and delinquency, and advocates the effectiveness of early prevention during childhood."

  "text" : "Mother Hutton was an 18th-century British pharmacist and herbalist responsible for the discovery of digitalis and its essential use in the curing of heart problems. She is sometimes referred to as Mrs. Hutton, Old mother Hutton and \"the old woman from Shropshire\". As her last name alludes, she hailed from Shropshire, England. She was a successful practitioner of general medicine but became most famous for her ability to treat heart disease, kidney troubles and dropsy. She discovered the usefulness of the foxglove plant (Digitalis purpura) in treating the above. She experimented with the foxglove until she worked it out to a science. She added it and a variety of other herbs to a specially brewed tea, which she gave out as a remedy to those who needed it. One of her most famous success stories was with the Dean of Brazen Nose College of Oxford University, Dr. Cauley in 1776. He came to her with a severe case of Dropsy which was a condition in which liquid built up in the tissue due to an inability of the heart and kidneys to remove it. During the 18th century this was considered a fatal disease. She successfully cured him. William Withering heard of this successful case and started to pursue Mother Hutton in order to find out the ingredients of her secret tea recipe. In 1785 he persuaded her to sell it to him and upon discovering that it was the foxglove which was the key, he published a paper called An Account of the Foxglove and Some of Its Medical Uses which has ever since, caused his name to be associated with the discovery of digitalis as opposed to hers. In reality 'Mother Hutton' was created in 1928 in an illustration by William Meade Prince as part of an advertising campaign by Parke-Davis who marketed Digitalis preparations. There is no mention of a Mother Hutton in Withering's works and no mention of him meeting any old woman directly - he is merely asked to comment on an old woman's receipt (Recipe) by a colleague. Since 1928, Mother Hutton's status has grown from being an image in an advertising poster to an acclaimed Wise Woman, Herbalist, Pharmacist and Medical Practitioner in Shropshire who was cheated out of her true recognition by Dr. Withering's unscrupulous methods. Withering was in fact informed of the Brazen Nose College case by one of his medical colleagues (and the Dean was treated with Digitalis Root not Leaves) . This myth has been created by authors not going back to primary sources but instead copying and then embellishing the work of others. See \"Withering and The Foxglove; the making of a myth\" by D.M. Krikler Br Heart J 1985 54: 256-257."

For his political Biography, he wrote: \"In 1882 I was an eight years old man weighting about 75 Kg\". His excessive weight (reportedly reached 275 kg) made him well known. According to writer Luis Anton de Olmert, a circus visited A Coruña showing a German man as the fattest one in the world, but people got disappointed saying: \"Manolo Puga is fatter and you can see him down the street \"."

  "text" : "Sir Maurice Alan Cassidy GCVO CB (29 February 1880 – 22 October 1949) was a British doctor, physician to the King from 1937 until his own death. Maurice was born the eldest son of David McKay Cassidy, a doctor at the Lancaster Mental Hospital in Lancashire and was educated at Lancaster Grammar School and Clare College, Cambridge. He then entered St Thomas' Hospital in London as a medical student, qualifying M.B. in 1906 and M.D. in 1909. After working there for several years, including two as Resident Assistant Registrar, he was elected in 1913 a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and joined the honorary staff of St Thomas'. In 1914 he delivered the Goulstonian Lecture to the College of Surgeons on the subject of rheumatoid arthritis. During the First World War he spent two years in a Calais hospital, where he contracted pulmonary tuberculosis and had to be repatriated. In addition to his commitments at St Thomas' he was for some time Chief Medical Officer to the Metropolitan Police and was knighted C.B. on his retirement from the post in 1929. Although he had withdrawn from active duty at St Thomas' prior to the Second World War he nevertheless returned to duty for the duration of the war, retiring finally in 1945. He delivered the Harveian Oration to the Royal College of Physicians in 1946 on the subject of coronary disease. From 1946 to 1948 he served as President of the Royal Society of Medicine. In 1930 he had been appointed Physician to the Royal Household, and later Physician in ordinary to both King George V and King George VI. He was created first K.C.V.O. and then G.C.V.O.. He died at his home in London in 1949 following a car accident. He had married Elsie, daughter of Frederick Relfe but left no children."

  "text" : "Mary Dockray-Miller (born 1965) is an American scholar of Anglo-Saxon England, best known for her work on gender in the Anglo-Saxon period. She has published on female saints, on Beowulf, and on religious women. She teaches at Lesley University, where she is professor of English. Dockray-Miller is the author of Motherhood and Mothering in Anglo-Saxon England (St. Martin's Press, 2000), which utilized postmodern gender theory (the work of Judith Butler, Luce Irigaray, and others) to reinvestigate historical elements, such as double houses and Anglo-Saxon religious women, and literature, including Beowulf. At the time, it was \"the first and only monograph on motherhood to appear in Anglo-Saxon studies\". The book received a fair amount of attention from reviewers, though opinions were mixed, one reviewer stating that \"her historical analyses, however, are unsatisfying and problematic\" and that Dockray-Miller too easily conflates patriarchy with heroic society. On the other hand, a reviewer in Speculum praised the book as \"well argued and an important contribution to women's studies and Anglo-Saxon scholarship\". One reviewer pointed out flaws and strengths: \"Yet such problematic moments [renaming Grendel's Mother \"the seawulf\", and excluding Elene and Mary from her discussion of mothers] are offset by the books more sustained strengths: an exciting and original topic whose exploration raises awareness of motherhood in an early culture, and a persuasive thesis that is supported by fascinating historical analysis.\" Her chapter on mothers in Beowulf was considered \"intriguing and persuasive\" by one reviewer, but with the caveat that the conclusion on the politics of motherhood was \"sketchy\". Her most recent monograph is Saints Edith and Æthelthryth: Princesses, Miracle Workers, and their Late Medieval Audience (Brepols, 2009). She has published numerous journal articles is a contributor to the Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States (Greenwood, 1998)."

He performed with the Unhasu Orchestra at the Salle Pleyel concert hall in Paris in March 14, 2012. At the time, Mun told that Associated Press, \"Despite differing languages, we hope that we can easily understand each other through music and become friends,\" in an interview conducted shortly before the Parisian performance. The Chosun Ilbo reported on August 29, 2013, that Mun Kyong-jin, along with a dozen other prominent North Korean musicians, had been arrested on August 17, on charges of allegedly violating laws against pornography. According to the report, other arrested musicians were arrested as political dissidents or accused of possessing Bibles. The report said that Mun Kyong-jin was executed by firing squad on August 20, 2013. In addition, it claimed that a dozen other musicians were also executed with Mun, including pop singer Hyon Song-wol; several of Mun's colleagues from the Unhasu Orchestra; and dancers and singers from the Wangjaesan Light Music Band. The Unhasu Orchestra was reportedly disbanded following Mun's execution. However, it subsequently emerged that Hyon Song-wol had not been executed."

He was treated by a Muslim physician named Şinasi (Shinasi or Schinasi in European languages) and regained his health. His parents named him henceforth Moris Şinasi as a gesture of gratitude. He had two brothers Solomon, Yaakov and a sister Sultana. He was forced to leave the school and jobbed in a Jewish cemetery as guard. At the age of fifteen, he left Turkey for Alexandria, Egypt, where he lived until he was nearly thirty. It was then that Garaffolo, a successful Greek tobacco merchant, who informally adopted Schinasi in Alexandria, determined that Schinasi should seek his fortune in America. In 1892, he immigrated to the USA."

While preferring mural work, which he considered less commercial, Orozco Rivera also created oils and sculptures. Many of these works were exhibited in Mexico and abroad and can be found in many major collections. His work received recognition in various countries."

Two years later, Tomizawa qualified for his second Japanese team, as a 28-year-old, in the RS:X class at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London by finishing twenty-sixth and receiving a berth from the ISAF World Championships in Perth, Western Australia. Delivering a mediocre effort in the opening series, Tomizawa pulled off a fourth position to move him up in the overall rankings on the tenth leg, but came up short for the medal race with a net score of 209 points and a twenty-eighth place finish in a fleet of thirty-eight windsurfers."

  "text" : "Madeleine Selina Rees, OBE is a British lawyer and current Secretary General of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She has spoken out against human rights abuses in Bosnia by peacekeepers and others working for the United Nations. Rees became a lawyer in 1990. She worked for a major British law firm, becoming a partner in 1994. There, she specialized in discrimination law, being particularly involved in the area of employment, and also specialized in public and administrative law. Rees worked on behalf of the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission where she helped to establish rights for individuals under domestic law. Discrimination cases brought by Rees have been heard at both the European Court of Human Rights and European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. In 1998, Rees started working as Head of Office in Bosnia and Herzegovina and as gender expert for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. She helped to expose human rights abuses related to the sex trade in Bosnia by testifying in support of Kathryn Bolkovac, a United Nations International Police Force monitor who was hired to help end sexual abuse and forced prostitution in Bosnia. Bolkovac revealed use of prostitutes and participation in sex trafficking by members of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2009, Rees was demoted from her position, and then in March 2010 she was fired. A United Nations' administrative disputes tribunal ruled it as a wrongful dismissal. The office of the High Commissioner denied the charges, stating that Rees had at first been reassigned to a new position due to complaints by senior managers about her job performance, and that she then did not accept the new position she had been offered. However, dispute tribunal justice Judge Coral Shaw ruled that reassigning Rees to a new post was unlawful. Rees was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to human rights, particularly women's rights, and international peace and security. She was portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave in the 2010 feature film The Whistleblower."

In 2007, as an independent advocate, he filed a public interest litigation petition in the Supreme Court in the case of Sant Muktabai Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana. In November 2013, during the Supreme Court judge-intern sexual harassment scandal, he filed petition against the victim, a leading newspaper which followed up the story, the attorney general and an online blog accusing them of \"criminal conspiracy\" and asking for contempt proceedings against them. One of his arguments in the case was that the petitioner learned from ancient books that a lady rarely speaks truth for solely truth’s sake and hence her words should not be trusted. Sharma has also challenged the validity of laws appointing the National Judicial Appointments Commission. However taking cognisance of certain \"irresponsible and scandalous allegations levelled by him\" against India parliamentarians, Court issued show cause notice to him asking “why he should not be debarred from filing and/or canvassing any Public Interest Litigation\"."

  "text" : "Mikhail Sergeyevich Sheremetyev (Russian: Михаил Сергéевич Шереметьев; born March 28, 1985 in Saint Petersburg) is a Russian sailor, who specialized in two-person dinghy (470). He represented Russia, along with his brother Maksim Sheremetyev, in two editions of the Olympic Games (2008 and 2012), and has also been training for CSKA Moscow (Russian Army Sports Club) throughout most of his sporting career under personal coach Sergey Modestovich Egorov. As of September 2013, Sheremetyev is ranked no. 32 in the world for two-person dinghy class by the International Sailing Federation. Sheremetyev and his brother Maksim made their official debut at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where they finished twentieth in the men's 470 class with a net score of 157, edging out Belarusian duo Siarhei Dziasiukevich and Pavel Lahunou by a narrow, two-point gap from the final standings. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Sheremetyev competed for the second time as a skipper in the men's 470 class by finishing fifteenth and receiving a berth from the World Championships in Barcelona, Spain. Teaming again with his brother and crew member Maksim in the opening series, the Russian duo mounted two top 10 finishes on the fifth and seventh leg respectively to produce a remarkable grade of 130, but came up short for the medal race with a seventeenth-place finish in a fleet of twenty-seven boats."

  "text" : "Mook is the nom de plume of Michael Monack, a graffiti artist who was active in Pittsburgh in the early 2000s. The name means \"knucklehead or idiot.\" Mook began as a traditional graffiti artist targeting the South Side and Shadyside neighborhoods, but after his initial works were removed, he began placing his tags in hard to reach places, including tall bridges and highway overpasses. He drew the ire of the then-Pittsburgh Mayor Thomas J. Murphy, Jr., who had tried to provide an outlet for graffiti artists by allowing them to spray paint walls along the Eliza Furnace trail. He even etched \"Mook\" onto a Department of Public Works \"Graffiti Busters\" truck that was tasked with cleaning up graffiti. At one point, merchants from the South Side, tired of having their businesses targeted, caught him and roughed him up, resulting in the tagging of \"So you want to get tough?\" to appear on the nearby Birmingham Bridge. He became known around the city and the media, but more for the audacity of the placement of his tags than the artistry. According to Pittsburgh officials, \"He's going into areas no one's gone before.\" He even became known among law enforcement across Pennsylvania. After Mook began to gain some fame in the Pittsburgh area, it is possible that multiple copycats have used the name, meaning that not every \"Mook\" tag in the area necessarily was created by him. With Mook's fame as a daredevil graffiti artist growing, some residents objected to the public officials' efforts to capture him. He has public supporters who described him as \"determined and skilled and has a sense of humor,\" arguing that \"Although Mook has committed a crime, everyone loves him and he makes people happy.\" Others objected to the public praise of Mook, saying that his supporters should be responsible for cleaning up his graffiti. On November 1, 2001, after receiving anonymous tip letters, police arrested 18-year-old South Side resident Michael Monack. He was found with graffiti supplies. In October 2002, Monack avoided felony charges and pleaded guilty to criminal mischief and defiant trespass, and Common Pleas Judge Robert E. Colville sentenced him to community service and thousands of dollars in fines. On March 2003, police arrested Monack again for continuing to engage in graffiti. Monack had been spotted in the Armstrong Tunnel among a group of graffiti artists at 5 a.m.; from there he fled to the South Tenth Street Bridge, where he was arrested. His hearings were attended by neighborhood activists from areas targeted by his tagging where they expressed their extreme displeasure at his behavior. As of 2004, Mook had become a tattoo artist in Pittsburgh. When asked by the Pittsburgh Tribune Review about his opinion on the latest crop of the city's graffiti artists, he described them as \"garbage.\" Though, even years after ceasing his tagging, Mook's \"infamy precedes him in many circles of the city.\" However, his reputation as a graffiti artist in the city has been eclipsed by MFONE Mook \"made his reputation scaling bridge suspensions and highway underpasses to spray \"Mook\" in places where even angels fear to tread.\" Tony Norman, columnist for Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"

  "text" : "Leslie MacDonald Gill (6 October 1884 – 14 January 1947), commonly known as MacDonald Gill or Max Gill, was a noted early-twentieth century graphic designer, cartographer, artist and architect. Born in Brighton, he was the younger brother of Eric Gill, one of the leading figures of the Arts and Crafts movement. In 1914 his \"Wonderground Map\", commissioned by Frank Pick, and hung at every station, helped to save the London Underground by presenting an accurate map which also had a humorous side in cartoon style. Produced in poster form, it was also made available for sale to members of the public and proved to be very popular. Elder brother Eric, who at that time was engaged in a commission for Westminster Cathedral, was included at the bottom of the map. He was the designer of the standard upper case lettering used on headstones and war memorials by the Imperial War Graves Commission. But it is perhaps his illustrated maps for which he is most well known. These maps have featured in a series of exhibitions including Magnificent Maps exhibition in 2010 at the British Library, an exhibition MacDonald Gill, Out of the Shadows in 2011 at the University of Brighton and at the Mind the Map exhibition in 2012 at the London Transport Museum."

  "text" : "Matthias Schmid (born December 12, 1980 in Vienna) is an Austrian sailor, who specialized in two-person dinghy (470) class. He represented Austria, along with his partner Florian Reichstädter, in two editions of the Olympic Games (2008 and 2012), and has also been training for Yacht Club Breitenbrunn in Germany throughout most of his sporting career under his personal coaches Alfred Pelinka and Christian Binder. As of September 2013, Schmid is ranked second in the world for two-person dinghy class by the International Sailing Federation, following his successes at the North American Championships and Sailing World Cup Series in Miami, Florida, United States. Schmid made his official debut at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he paired up with skipper Florian Reichstädter in the men's 470 class. The Austrian duo finished twenty-fourth in a ten-round opening series with a net score of 164, trailing Switzerland's Tobias Etter and Felix Steiger by a narrow, two-point gap from the final standings. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Schmid competed for the second time as a crew member in the men's 470 class by finishing twenty-first and receiving a berth from the ISAF World Championships in Perth, Western Australia. Teaming again with Reichstadter in the opening series, the Austrian duo mounted an early lead on the first leg, but came up short for the medal podium with an accumulated net score of 107 points and a ninth-place finish in a fleet of twenty-seven boats."

  "text" : "Giovanna Margherita Dalmet, also called Delmaz and Dalmaz (1739 – 11 January 1817), was a Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Paolo Renier (r. 1779–1789). Margherita was before her marriage a tight rope dancer in Constantinople, were Paolo Renier met her and they married in 1751, after the death of his first spouse. According to other versions he met her at a Catholic orphanage there. Secretary of State Giuseppe Gradenigo described the role of the new doges marriage in his election: \" At noon on Friday his Serene Excellency Paolo Renier's election was declared. The newly made prince must have spent much money. He has purchased the balle for more than fifteen zecchini each, and of these there are about three hundred. He started with the idea that it would be an easy matter, but whilst engaged in it he heard himself called a traitor to his country, deceitful, and married to a plebeian woman of bad character, formerly a rope-dancer – words which seemed to resound on all sides, and undoubtedly excited the people against him ... He was obliged to make a virtue of necessity, and to draw out a large number of those 90,000 zecchini that he is supposed to have made at Constantinople, in order to stop people's mouths. And in the end the public was fully satisfied. During three days' feasting in the Palace, money, bread, and wine were profusely distributed, and produced loud hurrahs and acclamations.\" Because of her past, she was not accepted by the Venetian aristocracy, who referred to her as La Falsa Dogaressa: the candidacy of Andrea Tron to the office of Doge had been damaged by the scandals of his noble wife Caterina Tron, and Delmaz would have been even less accepted in the role of dogaressa, as she could not be inscribed in the Golden Book. Nevertheless, she was acknowledged as such. However she refrained nonetheless from playing that role in official ceremonies, and the representational duties of the dogaressa was performed by the niece of her spouse, Giustina Renier Michiel. In June 1786, she visited the waters of Eecoaro in Valdagno as dogaressa under the treatment of Doctor Girolamo Festari. As dogaressa, she let out the pavement of the della Paglia bridge, for artists' shops, and obtained 1,000 zecchini for letting the Priorato della Ga^ di Bio. Margherita was said to damage the reputation and popularity of the doge. Margherita is known for a story about her dislike of the sound of church bells: her consort allegedly paid the abbey near the doge palace not to ring the bells, and whenever he was late with the payment, the convent rang the bells. Margherita was involved in a case of counterfeit as the accused. On 3 October 1786, during his stay in Venice, Goethe witnessed the public trial against her in the Ducal Palace. The case was about a deed of trust, and the lawsuit was against the Doge, but in reality against the dogaressa, who was in fact present on the bench of the accused, dressed in the robes of the dogaressa. Goethe describes her as \"woman of a certain age, of a noble appearance; she had a handsome face, but a severe expression, and a certain air of melancholy!\""

He studied first at Lancing College in Sussex and then later at the Central School of Arts (now Central St. Martins – University of the Arts), as well as the Académie Colarossi in Paris. In 1927-1928, he moved to Toronto in hopes of avoiding The Great Depression. His abstract paintings were created exclusively with acrylics and acrylic polymers, and his work is heavily influenced by the Surrealist movement. In fact, Forster claimed that he never planned any of his compositions, but rather that they were created according to the demands of his subconscious. Canadian art critic Paul Duval deemed him \"Canada's pioneer surrealist.\" As a painter, Forster wanted to embody the transference of light and the patterns of nature into instinctive abstract forms. Following in the footsteps of John Constable, he took great inspiration from the ever-changing light and cloud formations of the sky."

  "text" : "Mahlon Betts (1795–1867) was a carpenter, railroad car builder, shipwright, businessman, banker, and legislator who helped found three of Wilmington, Delaware's major manufacturing enterprises: the Harlan and Hollingsworth Company, the Pusey and Jones Company, and the Betts Machine Company. Born in Attleboro in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, on March 16, 1795, Betts came to Wilmington in 1812. On November 8, 1818, he married Mary R. Seal at the Wilmington Friends Meeting. In 1828 (or 1829), he built a foundry at 8th and Orange Streets and there installed the state's first stationary steam engine. On March 1, 1836, Betts joined Samuel N. Pusey to launch Betts & Pusey, which built railroad cars at a plant at Water and West Streets. He eventually leased the foundry to his son Edward (1825–1917), who carried on the business. In 1837, Mahlon became a director of the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad. The railroad soon merged into the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, which thenceforth operated the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore. (This main line survives today as part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.) Betts became a director in the merged railroad, and his service as a railroad executive is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument in Philadelphia. He was also a director of the National Bank of Wilmington and Brandywine, the president of the Mechanics Bank, and the president of First National Bank of Wilmington. In the 1840s, he served in the Delaware legislature, first as a representative and then as a senator. Mahlon Betts died in Wilmington on March 4, 1867."

He served as Minister for Corrections and Minister for Police and Emergency Services in the Kirner government from 1990 to 1992. Sandon was born in Chelsea and educated at Chelsea State School and Mordialloc Chelsea High School. He worked in clerical and laboring jobs from 1963 to 1969 before studying a Bachelor of Arts at Simon Fraser University in Canada, graduating in 1972 and winning the Robert Standfield Prize in political science. He was a postgraduate student and part-time tutor in the sociology department at La Trobe University from 1973 to 1976, a lecturer in the department of liberal studies at Swinburne Institute of Technology from 1974 to 1975, and a federal industrial officer with the Municipal Officers Association from 1976 until his election to parliament in 1982. He joined the Labor Party in 1972, and served as president of its Aspendale branch, and was the Labor campaign director for Isaacs at the 1980 federal election. Sandon was elected to the Legislative Council at the 1982 state election. He served on the Public Bodies Review Committee (1982-1988), House Committee (1983-1985), Public Bodies Review Committee (1982-1988), and Legislative Council Estimates Committee (1986-1988). He resigned from the Legislative Council in 1988 to contest the Legislative Assembly seat of Carrum at the 1988 state election, and won the seat. He served as Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet under John Cain from 1989 to 1990, and Minister for Corrections and Minister for Police and Emergency Services from 1990 to 1992 under Joan Kirner. In the Legislative Assembly, he also served on the Social Development Committee (1988-1989) and the Crime Prevention Committee (1992-1994). Sandon was narrowly re-elected when the Kirner government lost the 1992 election, but lost his spot in the shadow ministry after not attending a meeting of his Labor Unity faction. He was promoted back into the shadow ministry as Shadow Minister for Education shortly after. Sandon was defeated by Liberal candidate David Lean at the 1996 election, one of the few Labor casualties in an election in which Labor won several seats from the Kennett Liberal government. He said after his loss that he could not explain the result except that \"voters had not reacted to such issues as privatisation and the casino\". Sandon later served a brief stint as an adviser to Bracks government transport minister Peter Batchelor, preparing a report on road safety and accident blackspots."

From 1849 to 1855 he was a member of the Société d'agriculture de Lyon. After his death, his biography was composed by Étienne Mulsant (\"Notice sur Marc-Antoine Timeroy\", F. Dumoulin 1859). In 1860 the genus Timeroyea (syn: Pisonia) was named after him by Jean Xavier Hyacinthe Montrouzier. Also, plants with the specific epithet of timeroyi are named in his honor, an example being Galium timeroyi. The standard author abbreviation Timeroy is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Marcus Charles Illions (1871–1949) was a master carver of wooden carousel horses and other figures who flourished in the Coney Island section of the New York City borough of Brooklyn in the early 20th Century. The New York Times referred to him as \"the Michelangelo of carousel carvers\". Illions was born in 1870 or 1871, in Lithuania becoming a builder of circus wagons before emigrating to England, where he carved carousel horses. An alternative account in an obituary states that he was actually born in England. He came to America in 1888 where he carved for Charles I. D. Looff and William F. Mangels in Coney Island before starting his own company, M. C. Illions and Sons Carousell Works, in 1909. His five children were all active in the business from very early ages, in roles that included carver and commercial artist. At one time in the early 1900s, ten carousels carved by Illions operated in Coney Island. Illions was an exponent of what has become known as the Coney Island style of carousel figure carving, which \"is characterized by flamboyant horses, bedecked with jewels and gold and silver leaf\". By 1909, Illions' company produced \"a new line of horses with explosive, flying manes and powerful, straining bodies, decked out with latticework harnesses and other virtuoso feats of carving\". A machine known as Feltman's Carousel is considered by one source to have been Illions' best work. Though no longer intact, 24 of its horses were incorporated into the Flushing Meadows Carousel in 1964 and are still in use today. The Great Depression of the 1930s decreased demand for amusement products and Illions experienced financial problems. He died broke in 1949. His legacy includes extant carousels across the United States which are listed here: During the restoration of the B&B Carousell for its 2013 reopening on the Coney Island Boardwalk, it was discovered that one of the horses is in fact by Marcus Illions. All of the other horses were executed in the early 1920s by another well-known Coney Island carver, Charles Carmel. The Illions horse was one of a set of four executed in 1909 to commemorate the centennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, and features colorful rhinestones and a relief of Lincoln's profile. This is the only one of the set that can be ridden by the public today, as the other three are all in private collections. The most recent prior owner of the B&B had used the Illions horse to replace one of the Carmel horses that an earlier owner had removed from the carousel."

She was born in the Northumberland Strait Peninsula of Malagash, Nova Scotia where her father worked in the salt mine after he returned from the Second World War. When the mine shut down in the mid-fifties, Murray’s father re-enlisted in the military. While he was a soldier at CFB Gagetown in the 1960s, she grew up in PMQ (Permanent Married Quarters) enclave of Oromocto, New Brunswick. Murray attended the University of New Brunswick to pursue her love of literature. After earning an Honours B.A. in English, a B.Ed., and an M.A. (Canadian Literature), she travelled to British Columbia. Drawn to the temperate climate and fruitful abundance of the Okanagan Valley, Murray settled in Kelowna in 1987 where she has been teaching English at Okanagan College and raising her two sons. Murray began writing her first book, For Your Tomorrow: The Way of an Unlikely Soldier, after her nephew was killed in Afghanistan in 2007. She felt compelled to write his story, to create meaning out of his life and the chaos of his death. Currently, Murray is writing a book of historical fiction set in late eighteenth century Scotland."

  "text" : "Marvin Koner (1921-1983) was an American photographer who became known for his photographs of Johnny Cash and Miles Davis which he published in Pageant and other magazines. For nearly four decades, American photojournalist Marvin Koner, traveled the world capturing the people, places and personalities that shaped the latter half of the 20th century. Born into a family of Russian intellectuals in New York City, Marvin Koner would come to see the world through the eye of his camera - observing and chronicling the ordinary and extraordinary. Stationed in the South Pacific during World War II, Koner served as a First Lieutenant in the Army Photo Intelligence Unit where his interest in photography began. At the end of the war he returned to New York determined to make a career in photography, and enabled by the G.I. Bill, studied with Alexy Brodovitch, the renowned art director of Harper's Bazaar Magazine. Spearheading the use of the 35mm. camera and available light, for the next 30 years, Koner's work appeared in leading magazines, including Life, Fortune, Look,Esquire and Collier's. During the course of his career Koner received numerous awards from professional journals and served a number of terms as Vice-President of The American Association of Magazine Photographers. Koner photographed many distinguished subjects, most notably Martin Luther King, Robert Frost, Margaret Mead, Robert Kennedy, Frank Lloyd Wright and Eleanor Roosevelt. Always eager to tell a story, Koner photographically retraced James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" main character, Leopold Bloom's journey through Dublin, covered the exchange of prisoners at the end of the Korean war for Collier'sMagazine, and in the early 1960's followed the migration by boat, of an Italian family to New York. When the interest in photojournalism diminished and virtually disappeared, Koner turned from magazines to corporate photography on an international scale. His color images of industry, architecture, nature and portraiture have been published worldwide. Marvin Koner died in 1983 at the age of 62. His photographs are in the permanent collections of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the International Center for Photography, where a one-man show of his work was held in 1993. He is survived by his wife, Silvia Koner, former articles editor of Redbook Magazine and his daughter, Pam Koner, founder and executive director of the non-profit, Family-to-Family, Inc. (www.family-to-family.org). A complete selection of his work can be found at: www.marvinkonerarchive.com"

She recorded Klavierstücke Op. 118 and Op. 119 by Johannes Brahms in 2013. She played works from her last CD at her debut concert in Berlin, at the Konzerthaus Berlin on 22 October 2013, along with Praeludium, Op. 32, by Graham Waterhouse and Mendelssohn's Variations sérieuses, Op. 54."

  "text" : "Mary Penington (1623–1682) was one of the early members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). She wrote an autobiography On Quakers, Medicine, and Property, that was discovered and published 40 years after her death. Mary Penington was the only daughter of Sir John Proude, an army officer from Kent. Mary became an orphan at the age of three years, and was taken into the care of Sir Edward Partridge, a bachelor, and lived with other guardians who Mary later said wanted for \"religious rigour\". Around the age of nine, Mary went to live with Partridge's widowed sister, a practicising surgeon, Lady Katherine Springett. Katherine had three other children, including a son, Sir William Springett, whom Mary married at the age of 18. Contrary to the conventions of the day, they married without a ring. It appears the marriage was happy. Mary bore a son John; then while heavily pregnant with a second child, Mary heard that her husband, fighting on behalf of the Roundheads, was seriously ill following the recapture of Arundel from Cavaliars. Sir William Springett had succumbed to a fever. Mary rushed to be with him, and managed to be with him briefly before he died on 3 February 1644. Their daughter was born within the week, and named Gulielma (after William) Maria Postuma. Mary did not baptise Gulielma, despite the heavy pressure that came from relatives and church ministers. Mary was joined in running the household and raising her family by her mother-in-law Katherine Springett. They shared a strong friendship, and both had offers of marriage, but declined. Katherine taught Mary about managing her estates and inheritance. Mary and Gulielma also learned more about medicine from Katherine. Mary continued to seek a true path for her religious beliefs though \"wearied in seeking and not finding.\" She took up architectural designing of buildings. Mary designed architectural structures and supervised their construction. In 1654, Mary met Isaac Penington. She was attracted to his religious viewpoints. They married the same year, and around the same time became Quakers. As a result, Penington's Chalfont Grange was seized, leaving them potentially bankrupt. Thanks to Mary's financial skills, the family stayed solvent, and Mary was able to purchase a house, enabling them to remain joined to the Chalfont Saint Peter Quaker meeting. Isaac was gaoled half a dozen times for offences including refusing to take an oath, and attending a Quaker meeting, which was forbidden. Mary had five children with Penington. Her daughter by her first marriage, Gulielma, married William Penn. Soon after Isaac's death in 1679, Mary went into decline. She died in 1680. Her Diary has been cited as an excellent example of Quaker spiritual autobiographies."

Subsequent instructors included Grandmaster William Lombardy who included much chess culture and endgame technique, and Grandmaster Joel Benjamin. In 2008, Arnold played at the World Open chess tournament, where he defeated Vadim Milov.Much of Marc Arnold's development past candidate master to International Master can be attributed to his training with Grandmaster John Fedorowicz. British Champion and Grandmaster Mark Hebden worked with Marc during the World Junior Chess Championship in 2010. Grandmaster Yuri Shulman took over training for the accomplishment of the Grandmaster title. Arnold is the first chess Grandmaster to graduate from Columbia Grammar and Prep School (CGPS) in New York, New York. He was discovered to be very apt at capturing by values and trading queens early. Sophia Rohde, wife of Grandmaster Michael Rohde, taught curriculum classes in Kindergarten and 1st Grade at Columbia Grammar and brought Arnold to the attention of NM John Mac Arthur during an after-school chess program in 1999. Arnold won the US National School Grade Championship (2nd Grade), Orlando, Florida in December 2000. Arnold graduated CGPS in 2011, becoming a founding member of the Columbia Grammar and Prep School Chess Hall of Fame. Arnold is currently attending Indiana University."

Among the goals Lysko had was to bring an expansion team to Ottawa, which hadn't seen a CFL franchise since the Ottawa Rough Riders folded in 1996. On October 21, 2001, the Ottawa Renegades was formed, but instability in the franchise led to its folding in 2006. However, on March 20, 2002, Lysko was fired as commissioner after he made comments towards the Toronto Argonauts regarding their hiring of Garth Drabinsky as a consultant; the deal with Drabinsky, who had been under investigation for alleged fraud, was regarded by Lysko as a \"deal with the devil.\" Argonauts owner Sherwood Schwarz called for Lysko's firing, and he was unanimously voted to be fired by the board of governors. Lysko had spent only 15 months as commissioner, and is the only commissioner in league history to be fired by the board. After his firing, Lysko became the director of athletics at the University of Western Ontario, which included the renovations of TD Waterhouse Stadium, Alumni Hall and Thames Hall. However, Lysko left the position on July 20, 2007, citing his intentions to move close to his wife Kathryn's parents as among the reasons for his departure."

  "text" : "Maxine Powell (May 30, 1915 – October 14, 2013) was an American etiquette instructor and talent agent. She taught grooming, poise, and social graces to many recording artists at Motown in the 1960s. Born Maxine Blair in Texarkana, Texas, she was raised by her aunt in Chicago, Illinois. She graduated from Hyde Park High School in 1933, attended Madam C.J. Walker's School of Beauty Culture, and worked as a manicurist to finance her acting studies; she also studied elocution and dance. In the early 1940s she worked as a model and as a personal maid, and she developed a one-woman show, An Evening with Maxine Powell, which she performed with a group at the Chicago Theatre. She moved to Detroit, Michigan, in 1945 and taught self-improvement and modeling classes before opening the Maxine Powell Finishing and Modeling School in 1951. She bought a large house in 1953, which became the largest banquet facility in Detroit for African Americans, and worked as a talent agent, bringing black productions and artists to Detroit theaters and placing black models in advertising campaigns. Around this time she hired a printing business to prepare programs for her annual Las Vegas–style fashion show. The business was operated by the family of Berry Gordy. She and Gordy became friends, and in the early 1960s he asked her opinion of the young artists that had signed with his record company, Motown. In 1964, she closed her school to be a consultant to Motown's talent. When Motown expanded into new offices in 1966, she was hired to work in the company's department of artist personal development, teaching artists such as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Marvin Gaye, the Jackson 5 and the Supremes, whose Mary Wilson stated Powell taught them more than stage presence, but \"tools for us as human beings\". In Powell's words, she turned them into performers \"fit for kings and queens.\" Powell left Motown in 1969 and taught personal development courses from 1971 until 1985 at Wayne County Community College. On May 31, 2013, Powell suffered a fall. Her health steadily declined until her death of natural causes on October 14, 2013, at the age of 98 at Providence Hospital in Southfield, Michigan."

  "text" : "Max Mangold (born May 8, 1922 in the village of Pratteln near Basel, Switzerland, died February 3, 2015) taught phonetics, phonology and linguistic theory at the University of the Saarland in Germany. He produced phonetic notation for numerous reference works and pronunciation dictionaries, among them the Duden dictionary of German pronunciation. His many contributions to German phonology are seminal and comprehensive. He also oversaw scientific theses, dissertations (nearly 100 of them, many the first and only records of endangered languages) and other publications, for example on dialects in the Saarland and the Rhineland-Palatinate. Mangold showed a strong interest in linguistic matters in his early years and learned many languages, including Esperanto, actively speaking nearly 40 languages in his prime. The foreign language that he spoke best was probably Italian. He studied in Basel, Geneva, Paris and London. His work afterward included service as an interpreter for the United Nations from 1953-1954 during the Korean War for French, German, English, Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Swedish and Chinese. After receiving his doctorate under Walther von Wartburg and habilitation in Basel in 1956, he was appointed a full professor of phonetics at the University of the Saarland in Germany in 1957 after lecturing at universities in Basel, Zurich and Bonn."

He was able to elucidate the function of the period gene, which is necessary for the fly to exhibit normal sleep cycles. Young's lab is also attributed with the discovery of the timeless and doubletime genes, which makes proteins that are also necessary for circadian rhythm."

He was appointed Professor of Anatomy in Stockholm in 1716, but soon left for a position at Collegium medicum, where he became president in 1724. He was elevated in 1726 to nobility. Bromelius wrote many papers in numismatics, medicine and science. Some of them are contained in the \"Acta Literaria et Scientiarum Sveciæ\", including \"Introduction to essential knowledge to recognize and order all sorts of rocks, metals and fossils, etc.\" (1730). According to Elias Fries he was the first Swede to describe plant fossils. In Lithographia Suecana (1727) Bromelius discusses fossil trilobites, corals and shells from Gotland, graptolites, and plant fossils. The mineral bromellite was named in his honour."

  "text" : "Marco Coretti (born in Rome) is an Italian fashion designer. After studying Arts he moved to Paris where he trained as apprentice and then worked as assistant to some haute couture ateliers. In 1997, he returned to Italy where he created his first couture accessories and shoes line, gaining immediate interest from both press and celebrities such as Sophia Loren and Madonna.In 1999 the launch of his own brand followed spotting the 'extreme white' collection in the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana fashion week: he was praised for the launch of the 'new-chic' style. Among the many national and international magazines to celebrate his creativity, in 2001 Milano Finanza fashion dedicated its cover to the young designer. On the same year, he is mentioned in fashion press worldwide after Béatrice Dalle destroys a black dress worth thousands of euros while closing the runway at the Rome's fashion week. In 2004 he became creative director at Sorelle Fontana, one of the oldest Italian fashion houses; on the following year he was chosen by the Municipality of Rome and AltaRoma as art director of The Ages of Fashion, a project meant for the recovery of Italian haute couture.His passion for haute couture and the arts in general has led him to collaborations with renowned artists such as Carla Accardi, Luigi Ontani, Paola Gandolfi and famous photographers as Gian Paolo Barbieri, Michel Comte, Alberta Tiburzi and many others. In 2010 he created the costumes for the Mvula Sungani's show for celebrating the 50th anniversary of the dancer Raffaele Paganini. Famous models such as Nadège, Debra Shaw, Maria Carla Boscono, Mădălina Diana Ghenea have run the catwalk with his dresses and topmodels such as Linda Evangelista and Carol Alt have modelled for his campaigns. In 2013, he became the first fashion designer ever to create a new packaging of a pasta (Maffei) tying two Italian excellences in the world: fashion and food."

  "text" : "Motoyuki Takabatake (高畠素之 Takabatake Motoyuki, 1886 – 1928) was a Japanese journalist and an activist who joined the small Japanese anarchist movement in his youth. During the Russian Revolution, however, he began to reconsider his support of socialism. While Japanese Marxists saw the state in Soviet-Russia as a temporary and necessary evil needed to construct socialism, Takabatake welcomed the revolution precisely because it would lead to a strong centralized state. This led to a break between him and other Japanese Marxists, with Takabatake becoming one of the first theoreticians of national socialism in Japan. He completed the first Japanese translation of Das Kapital in 1924 and was preparing for the establishment of a national socialist party when he died in 1928."

He returned to defend his Egmond Half title, but managed only fifth on that occasion. Two more bests came at the start of 2008 as he timed 59:55 minutes for fifth at the 20 van Alphen road race and 2:08:32 at the Paris Marathon, finishing sixth overall. He also failed to retain his title in Chuncheon, managing a lacklustre 2:13:07 hours. He was only marginally faster (2:12:55) at the JoongAng Seoul Marathon – his only race of 2011. Although he was sixth at the 2012 Amsterdam Marathon, he achieved a best of 2:07:11 hours. A run of 2:10:40 was only enough for tenth at the 2013 Seoul International Marathon, but his first victory over the distance followed at the lower profile Ljubljana Marathon in October."

From 1901 to 1910, he was president of the natural history museum of Carinthia, and for a period of time served as president of the Kärntner Gartenbauvereins (Carinthian Horticultural Society). Also, he taught classes at the Gartenbauschule (school of horticulture) in Klagenfurt.

  "text" : "Myer Feldman, known as Mike Feldman (June 22, 1914 – March 1, 2007) was an American political aide in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Hailing from Philadelphia, Feldman was a trained lawyer and alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania which he attended on a scholarship. He served in the Army Air Force during the Second World War prior to joining Kennedy's campaign trail in 1957. Under Kennedy he was tasked with compiling negative information on Richard Nixon during Kennedy's election campaign as well as helping with speech writing and television interviews. His files on Nixon became known collectively as the \"Nixopedia\". He also worked on agriculture issues and foreign relations on the subject of nuclear arms sales, often meeting secretly with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and Foreign Minister Golda Meir. He was known for the rhyming couplets used when he and Theodore C. Sorensen, whom he succeeded as White House Counsel, traded memos. In 1964 The New York Post called him “the White House’s anonymous man.” Upon Kennedy's assassination, Johnson retained Feldman for similar tasks against election rival Barry Goldwater. After retiring from government service in 1965, Feldman founded a law firm that dealt with legal issues in radio, and chaired committees on the Special Olympics. In this role he created the \"President's Council on Mental Retardation\" and was key to the events early organisation. He was also a literary critic and playwright. He died in Bethesda, Maryland in 2007."

He was one of the founders of the European Journal of Combinatorics, which began publishing in 1980. His initial research was in graph theory, and particularly in the theories of matching and connectivity. Beginning in 1975, he became one of the pioneers of the theory of oriented matroids, and since that time he was interested in connections between combinatorics and geometry. A workshop on combinatorial geometry, held in Marseilles in April 2013, was dedicated to his memory."

A Dominican friar, he was appointed the Bishop of the Diocese of Kilmore by the Holy See on 2 December 1728. His episcopal ordination took place in the Palace of the Vatican on 12 December 1728; the principal consecrator was Pope Benedict XIII. Bishop MacDonagh returned to Ireland in 1730, but was forced to flee the country in 1739. In a Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, held in Rome on 6 December 1740, he informed the cardinals that he had personally governed the see for nine years, but was incarcerated by Irish magistrates in July 1739. As a Roman Catholic prelate, he would have incurred the penalties of high treason had he not been rescued from the hands of his jailers. On making his escape to Dublin a reward of £200 was offered for his apprehension. His cross, rings, books and papers had been taken from him to serve as evidences of his episcopal rank. He remained in exile until his death in Lisbon, Portugal on 26 November 1746, aged 48, and was buried there in the church of Irish Dominicans."

She rode her mother's novice mare, Scorched Earth, to victory in the flat race \"Goya Stakes\" at Kempton Park on 6 May 1972. Neither horse nor jockey had raced previously, and this was the first race in which female jockeys were allowed to ride under Jockey Club Rules. She went on to ride in and win several races, becoming European Champion in 1974. She was appointed MBE in 1976, a year after retiring from race riding. She opened an equestrian yard and became an instructor, and later went on to train point-to-pointers and hunter chasers with her husband. In 2002 she died of cancer at the age of 53 having raised several thousand pounds for Sparks, a children's cancer charity."

Hervey was born in Glasgow, Scotland, when eighteen years of age he emigrated to Sydney, New South Wales, and ultimately was largely engaged in pastoral pursuits in the Port Phillip District, which in 1851 was constituted the separate colony of Victoria. He played two first-class cricket matches for Victoria in 1851 and 1852. Hervey was elected to the part-nominated Victorian Legislative Council on 3 June 1853 for the Murray district and sworn-in August 1853. When responsible government was achieved he was returned to the first wholly elective Legislative Council for the Eastern Province in November 1856. From March 1861 to November 1862 he was acting president of the latter body during the absence in England of Sir James Frederick Palmer. When the James McCulloch Ministry was formed in June 1863 Hervey accepted a portfolio as Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works and Commissioner of Public Works. Hervey resigned both his office and his seat in Parliament in July 1865, owing to having met with pecuniary reverses. Misfortune still continued to pursue him, and he died in Turnbull Plains, Benalla district, Victoria, under very sudden and distressing circumstances on 1 December 1874, when a coroner's jury returned a verdict that death had resulted from insufficient nourishment."

Takesaki studied at Tohoku University, earning a bachelor's degree in 1956, a master's degree in 1958 and a doctorate in 1965. Beginning in 1958 he was a research assistant at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and from 1965 to 1968 he was an associate professor at Tohoku University. From 1968 to 1969 he was a visiting associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1970, he became a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was also a visiting professor at Aix-Marseille University (1973–74) and Bielefeld University (1975–76). He is known for the Tomita–Takesaki theory, which is about modular automorphisms of von Neumann algebras. This theory was initially developed by Minoru Tomita until 1967, but his work was published only partially (in Japanese) and was quite difficult to understand, drawing little notice, before he presented it to Takesaki in 1970 in a book. In 1970, he was an invited speaker at the ICM in Nice; his talk was about one parameter automorphism groups and states of operator algebras. In 1990 he was awarded the Fujiwara Science Prize. He is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society."

  "text" : "Marinus Robyn van der Goes (alternative names: Marinus Robin van der Goes, Ignatius Cornelis Marinus, Ignatius Cornelis Marinus) (Goes or London?, 1599 - Antwerp, 1639) was a Flemish engraver. Historical data about van der Goes’ life are scarce. He was together with Hans Witdoeck a pupil of Lucas Vorsterman during the years 1630-31. He was admitted as a master of the Guild of St. Luke of Antwerp in 1632-1633. He had three pupils: Alexander Goubau, Antonius Coolberger and Gaspard Leemans. He worked as an engraver for the leading Flemish painters of his age. In Rubens' studio he belonged to the 'new generation' of engravers with the likes of Hans Witdoeck. There are 18 engravings made by van der Goes on the basis of Rubens’ designs. The techique of van der Goes was more free than that of Vorsterman and was thus extremely well suited to the Rubens’ style. The burin is applied with great finesse and fairly tightly and preserves across the plate a transparency and lightness that allows van der Goes to achieve the correct effect through relatively tempered black tones. He also made engravings for other prominent painters such as Jacob Jordaens, Adriaen Brouwer, Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh and Theodoor van Thulden. He signed all his engravings with Marinus. He died on 27 April 1639 in Antwerp and was buried in the local St. James' Church. In the burial register of the parish he was referred to as 'Marin van der Goes'."
