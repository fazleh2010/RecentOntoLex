His support for Henry VI lead to Nicholas being abducted by forces loyal to Henry’s brother Bolesław and he was held till 1327. \n*  Nicholas mediated in the conflict between his successor Bishop Nanker and John of Bohemia. \n*  Skilful negotiations by Nicholas, removed monetary claims of the papal legates, Peter of Auvergne and Galhard de Garceribus."

In 1753 he joined the painters' guild of Malá Strana. His works were influenced by concern for the welfare of his extended family. Therefore, he typically painted smaller formats and more marketable subjects. The basis of his works were small cabinet pictures, often genre works, but also landscapes and biblical themed works."

  "text" : "Noel Burgess is an Australian electronic dance music producer. Burgess formed Vision Four 5 whilst studying Music Technology at the Conservatorium of Music in Brisbane, Queensland with fellow students Gavin Sade, Harry Ho and later Ben Suthers to perform live electronic dance music at night clubs. The popularity and uniqueness of the band attracted the attention of Tim Gruchy, a Brisbane-based video artist who was part of the Rat Parties team at the time. Vision Four 5 was quickly signed to Volition Records / Sony Music alongside stable mates Boxcar, Itch-E and Scratch-E, Severed Heads, Southend, Single Gun Theory. Vision Four 5 was active from 1990-1997. During this time, Burgess also wrote, recorded and performed under the name of AapogeE with Ben Suthers and released through Candy Line Records (Melb, Aust) and Rabbit City Records (UK). Their most popular track was \"The Force\" (Come to the Darkside Mix). Burgess also collaborated with Boxcar's David Smith under the name of Gridlock and with Josh Abrahams as AapogeE vs The Pagan. Following a stint in the UK, Burgess returned to work mainly as a producer, co-writing/producing Groove Terminator's debut Album Road Kill (EMI Records), co-writing/producing with Groove Terminator as Chili Hi Fly, co-producing/mixing the unreleased Infusion album \"Everything Here is Good\" for Sony Music, which later was reworked to become Phrases and Numbers on Thunk Records and solo releases/performances as \"f.i.s.t\" through Pacifica Records, of which he was a partner. Music from \"f.i.s.t\" was also release on vinyl by Sydney's Nine09 label, who described the song \"AO (One Fist)\" as \"a powerful combination of minimal techno, and funk driven electronic energy\". Since 1999, Burgess has worked compiling/editing/mixing/mastering all the Ministry of Sound Australia compilations and \"One Love\"/Sony Music compilations. From 2000-2005 Noel was the Musical director for the Australian Dance Music Awards (DMA's) and Urban Music awards (UMA's). He later composed and produced the ABC children's series CJ the DJ for Kapow Pictures, a 52-episode musical cartoon about a 13-year-old girl DJ. Burgess currently lives in the Blue Mountains (New South Wales) with his family."

Before becoming a judge, Pillard was a tenured law professor at Georgetown University. She also served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Assistant to the Solicitor General. At the time of her confirmation to the federal bench, she was among the most accomplished Supreme Court advocates in the United States, having argued nine cases and briefed more than twenty-five before the Court. Pillard's nomination to the D.C. Circuit, along with the nominations of Robert L. Wilkins and Patricia Ann Millett, ultimately became central to the debate over the use of the filibuster in the United States Senate, leading to the controversial use of the nuclear option to bring it to the floor for a vote. She was narrowly confirmed by a vote of 51-44, with her detractors labeling her as one of the most liberal nominees to the federal bench in decades."

  "text" : "Nestore Leoni (L'Aquila, Abruzzo, February 14, 1862 – 1947) was an Italian painter and illuminator of manuscripts (miniatore). He was a resident of Florence. He first studied in L'Aquila, but later dedicated himself to the study of classic illumination of texts, including those in the Florentine Libraries, and set himself to imitating the antique. Among his first works was the cover of an Album, commemorating the arrival of the Emperor William II of Germany to Rome. This work was praised by the professor Niccolo Barabino of Florence. Leoni was utilized to make designs for porcelain and for documents given in memory of occasions, for example by the Società Filarmonica Fiorentina to Madame Hastreiter, after a charity concert. Cavaliere Civelli commissioned from him covers for his edition of La Vita Nuova by Dante, which he decorated on parchment, in a style from the 1500s, reproducted with chromolithography. He also completed in similar style the Canzone di Cino da Pistoia to Dante, on Death of Beatrice, offered to the queen of Italy in occasion of the centenary of Beatrice Portinari."

  "text" : "Natasha Falle (born 1973) is a Canadian professor at Humber College in Toronto, Ontario, Canada who was forcibly prostituted from the ages of 15 to 27 and now opposes prostitution in Canada. Falle grew up in a middle-class home and, when her parents divorced, her new single-parent home became unsafe, and Falle ran away from home. At the age of 15, Falle became involved in the sex industry in Calgary, Alberta. Falle's pimp kept her falsely imprisoned and trafficked her across the country. He married her and tortured her, breaking several of her bones and burning her body. In order to cope with the trauma of prostitution and violence, Falle became dependent on cocaine and almost died. Eventually, she got out of prostitution and, with her mother's support, went through drug rehabilitation, finished high school, and eventually received a diploma in Wife Assault and Child Advocacy from George Brown College. In 2001, Falle began counselling women in prostitution at Streetlight Support Services, and counselled more than 800 women in the subsequent decade, 97% of whom wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry. In order to make this statistic more widely known, Falle founded Sex Trade 101. She began offering training for police and she partners with the Toronto Police Service's sex crimes unit. Falle was one of the main proponents of Member of Parliament (MP) Joy Smith's private member's bill, Bill C-268, which was passed in June 2010 as An Act to amend the Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons under the age of eighteen years), and she helped the Canadian government formulate their appeal of the decision of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Bedford v. Canada to strike down various prostitution laws. Falle advocates adopting a law in Canada analogous to Sweden's Sex Purchase Act, which would decriminalize the selling of sex and criminalize the purchasing of sex."

  "text" : "Wiremu Teihoka \"Ned\" Parata OBE (c.1879 – 23 February 1949) was a New Zealand rugby union administrator. Of Ngāi Tahu descent, Parata was born at Puketeraki, near Karitane. He was the youngest son of Tame Parata and younger brother of Taare Parata. Educated at Te Aute College, Parata became a rugby union administrator after his playing days were ended by serious illness. He organised the first official New Zealand Māori rugby team in 1910 and managed the side on its tour of Australia. He underwrote the cost of touring with the profits from his motor car business. He subsequently managed the team on tours to Australia in 1913, 1922 and 1923. He also managed the team on their 1926–27 tour of New Zealand, Australia, Ceylon, France, England, Wales and Canada. In 1911, Parata became the first president of the Bay of Plenty Rugby Union, a position he held until 1925. He served on the New Zealand Rugby Management Committee between 1922 and 1926 in his capacity as president of the Māori Advisory Board. In 1943 he was the first Māori to be made a life member of the New Zealand Rugby Union. Parata stood for election to the New Zealand parliament as the United/Reform Coalition candidate in the  1932 Southern Maori by-election. He was unsuccessful, finishing a distant second behind the Ratana candidate Eruera Tirikatene. In the 1948 King's Birthday Honours, Parata was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to the Māori people. Parata died at Seacliff Hospital near Dunedin in 1949."

  "text" : "Neil McSweeney (born Irvine, Scotland) is a songwriter and musician based in Sheffield, England. His acoustic guitar playing style combines folk, blues and country influences but it is his voice, likened by The Guardian to a male Tracy Chapman, and his direct and personal lyrics  for which he is most recognised. McSweeney’s debut album, Remember To Smile was released in 2006 by Sheffield independent label, LM Music. Tracks from the album attracted national radio play from BBC Radio 2 and the digital station BBC Radio 6 Music. This led to Postcards being released as a single by Kids Records, the singles arm of Warner Music UK subsidiary 14th Floor Records. Further national radio exposure followed  including the track being playlisted by XFM. Around this time Neil also accompanied his friend Stoney both on record, on tour and in session for BBC Radio 2’s Dermot O’Leary at Maida Vale Studios. Extensive touring in the UK followed before second album, Shoreline emerged in 2009. This was self-released and attracted positive reviews in the national press  as well as the attention of fellow Sheffield musician, Richard Hawley. Following support sets at The Crucible in Sheffield and the Royal Festival Hall, McSweeney accompanied Hawley as main support on the European leg of his Truelove’s Gutter tour. During a hiatus from touring in 2011 and 2012, reportedly to spend more time with his young family, McSweeney developed friendships with musicians from the English folk and roots scene. This developed into collaborations which formed the basis for an EP (The Seventeen EP) and a third full-length album (Cargo) both released in 2013. The album features contributions from Lucy Farrell, Sam Sweeney, Brooks Williams, Matt Boulter, Vera Van Heeringen, Jock Tyldesley, Andy Seward and others. In Autumn 2013 Neil supported English folk group Bellowhead on their UK tour. He was accompanied by Vera van Heeringen and Sam Sweeney. Vera & Neil subsequently collaborated on an EP (released Oct 2015). Other projects include GluePot (with Lucy Farrell and M G Boulter), who released an EP (Lulu the Bear and other Stories) in 2015, and Holler with Fay Hield and Jon Boden."

  "text" : "Nicola Levoli (Rimini, 1728 – Rimini, February 21, 1801) was an Italian painter and an Augustinian monk. His name prior to becoming a monk (al secolo) was Remigio Enrico Policarpo. He was a pupil of Ubaldo Gandolfi, director of the Accademia Clementina in Bologna since 1761. Levoli is noted for painting still-life works and depictions of flowers. The Pinacoteca of Rimini has one of his works. He entered monastic life on January 29, 1747 in Bologna, in the convent of San Giacomo Maggiore. He however always leaned to painting, and by 1762 was a member of the Accademia Clementina di Bologna. He won a contest in 1765 for painting flowers. He collaborated with Gandolfi on some canvases, painting the flowers and objects. Levoli also painted some altarpieces and sacred works, now lost. By 1769, he had been associated with the convent of San Agostino in Rimini, where he lived till the suppression in 1797 after the French occupation. He moved to the Convent of Minori Osservanti till his death in 1801. Zauli Naldi (1961) attributed three still lifes in the Ongaro collection of Milan to Levoli, but the attribution was changed to a follower of Levoli's style, the nobleman from Rimini, Ludovico Soardi, (born 1764). In 1964, further still lifes were discovered, one of these is in the Pinacoteca civica of Faenza. Since then, over half a dozen attributions have been made. Some of them had been previously assigned to Arcangelo Resani. Later paintings resemble the style of Carlo Magini."

Nina Ward was instrumental in founding the Kalamazoo Institute of the Arts (KIA) where she was the first and only teacher for several years. She also exhibited her work at the Michigan Art Show (Detroit, 1932) and in 1945, after her death, Ward's paintings were shown in a joint exhibition with the work of her student, Helen Janaszak . In 1930 she published an article in The School-Arts Magazine, in which she described the program she founded at KIA. She specialized in portraits but also painted the occasional still life and scenes from New England where she often spent summers painting, often accompanied by one or two of her students. Nina Ward lived at 618 Potter Street in Kalamazoo, Michigan before her death on September 20, 1944, after a year-long sickness during which time she was nursed by her brother, Alexander Pitzer Ward. She was buried on September 25, 1944 at the Forrest Hills Cemetery in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Today her paintings are included in the permanent collections of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, The Woodmere Art Museum, and the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts. One of her still life paintings is included in the Olivet College exhibition, \"Beautiful Things: Still Life Paintings by American Women 1880-1940\" at Olivet College, January 16-February 14, 2014. A retrospective of her work is being mounted at KIA from May 16, 2015-August 23, 2015.

  "text" : "Niels Bukh (1880–1950) was a Danish gymnast and educator who founded the first athletic folk high school in Ollerup in Funen, Denmark. He achieved international fame as a gymnastics trainer for the Danish team at the Olympic Games in Stockholm in 1912. He was inspired by the rhythmic female gymnastics of the Finnish gymnastics educator Elli Björksténs (1870-1947) and the medical gymnastics of Kaare Theilmann. Within the tradition of Pehr Henrik Ling, Bukh developed his own primitive gymnastics, aimed at using forceful exercises in order to prevent stiffness and bad bodily habits. In 1931 his gymnastics team toured the world, visiting Japan where his system became highly influential. His system of exercise became highly popular in Germany, and in 1933 Bukh publicly expressed his allegiance to the National Socialist cause and its aim of improving the health of the Aryan race through gymnastics. This made Bukh unpopular in Denmark, especially after the German occupation of Denmark in 1940. Bukh support for Nazism caused a backlash in the form of a previous lover publicly revealing Bukh's homosexuality. Bukh had lived together with a male partner for several years, and his sexuality was well known in his family and among his friends and students. Biographers speculate that Bukh never became aware of the Nazi stance against homosexuality, even in spite of his frequent visits to Germany during the 1930s and -40s. In 1944 he bought the manor Løgismose, which he sold again in 1947."

  "text" : "Neil Docking is a British writer, composer and producer who has worked in press, radio, film, theatre and television. A self-taught pianist and musician, he began his career playing in bars and clubs in his native Wales before studying at the University of Westminster where he began writing articles for the students' union magazine ('The Smoke'). In 1997 The Guardian published some of his work and approached him to write a fictional column about student life (intended as a parody of Bridget Jones's Diary) and soon 'Neil Docking's Diary' – a semi-satirical portrait of university life – appeared in the newspaper. In spite of some complaints about the portrayal of students, Docking was nominated for Feature Writer of the Year at the Guardian/NUS Media Awards in 1997. Following graduation, Docking moved briefly into music journalism before penning a short film script, Without a Song or a Dance (which he later also scored) intended to be considered by Elton John's newly established Rocket Pictures. It was rejected but was eventually produced by BBC Wales (dir. Maxine Evans). The film opened the door for further script writing work first on the BBC Radio serial Station Road and then on the television series Nuts and Bolts for ITV1 Wales. He later worked as a writer, script doctor, storyliner and story editor on such long running British television shows such as Crossroads, Emmerdale (ITV) and Casualty (BBC). In 2012 he wrote the screenplay and music score for an independent feature film musical Summertime (retitled 'Rain'), directed by Maxine Evans. In 2001, Neil Docking was shortlisted for the Dennis Potter Screenwriting Award."

Later he held the position of ispán of Újvár County in 1203. As a loyal supporter of King Emeric, his person undoubtedly was not the same as the other Nicholas, who served as the first palatine for Andrew II of Hungary, Emeric's brother and rival in the throne fights. Consequently, Nicholas, the ban of Slavonia for Prince Andrew in 1200 was also a different baron. However, it is possible that a Nicholas, who functioned as ispán of Szatmár County in 1181, marked voivode Nicholas' early political career."

As a young adult he was in the Royal Navy and went to the Falkland Islands when the UK responded to the Argentinian invasion in 1982. People whose death mask he has created include Pat Castange, Lord Jago Elliot and George \"Taters\" Chatham, once the best-known thief in Britain; but perhaps his most controversial creation is the mask of John Joe \"Ash\" Amador, a 30-year-old American, who was executed in Huntsville, Texas for the 1994 murder of a San Antonio taxi driver. Reynolds also plays harmonica in Alabama 3, the London-based group that created The Sopranos' theme song."

  "text" : "Colonel Necabettin Ergenekon (born 1926, in Erzurum) is a Turkish Army officer who retired in 1982, having been commander of the Turkish Gendarmerie in Adıyaman Province after the 1980 Turkish coup d'état. Born Necabettin Baltacı, he changed his name \"some time in the '60s\" to avoid confusion with another person by the same name. At one time, Ergenekon was the commanding officer of Veli Küçük. Ergenekon was suspected by later-assassinated state prosecutor Cevat Yurdakul as being behind a string of mysterious deaths in the 70s, but no legal action was ever taken. With the development of public discussion about the Ergenekon organization in the 2000s, Ergenekon's name has sometimes been raised as a possible participant, possibly even responsible for its naming. Ergenekon rejects these allegations and says his name (chosen for the Ergenekon myth) has been besmirched by traitors. Key Ergenekon trials witness Tuncay Güney claims Ergenekon introduced him to Veli Küçük, a key defendant in the trials. Güney also alleged that Ergenekon had had discussions with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the 1980s. In December 2008 Yeni Şafak claimed that Ergenekon had led the 1995 Azeri coup d'état attempt, which had support from elements in Turkey."

  "text" : "Nana Forte (born 1981) is a Slovenian composer. She was born in Zagorje ob Savi, Slovenia. In 2005, Forte graduated in composition from the Music Academy in Ljubljana under Marko Mihevc. She continued her postgraduate studies at Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber in Dresden under Lothar Voigtländer from 2005 to 2007 and in Berlin at Universität der Künste under Walter Zimmermann (2007–09). Her works include compositions for solo instruments, chamber music, orchestral music and pieces for choir. Forte is one of the few young Slovenian composers who are composing much choral music. While studying she worked with many Slovenian choirs and conductors and was awarded a number of prizes for her choral compositions. Her compositions have been performed in concerts and festivals all over the Europe, including Young Euro Classic (DE), Weimarer Frühjahrstage (DE), Music Bienale Zagreb (CRO), Festival Bemus (SRB), Klara Festival (BE), Festival Emilia Romagna (I), Festival Semanas de Musica do Estoril (PT), Festival LES VOIXS DU PRIEURE (FR), Bienale of Contemporary Music Koper (SI), Ljubljana Festival (SI) and Festival Slowind (SI), and have been broadcast by various European classical music radio stations. Some of her pieces have been published and recorded. In 2007, she was chosen to represent the Republic of Slovenia in the project \"European Ensemble Academy\", organized by the German Music Council (Deutscher Musikrat) on the occasion of the German presidency of the European Union. Her piece Pritrkavanje, written for a chamber ensemble specially for this event, has been performed in Dortmund, Bremen, Ljubljana, Rome and Brussels. In August 2007, her orchestral composition Genesis was performed at the festival of Young Euro Classic in Berlin with the Music Academy Orchestra Ljubljana with conductor George Pehlivanian and soloists Jože Kotar (Cl.) and Borut Zagoranski (Acc.). In the same year she also presented her piece for choir Libera me at the Music Biennale Zagreb in Croatia. Her piece Libera me for two mixed choirs was the obligatory piece at the finals of the 5th International Competition for Young Choral Conductors Europa Cantat in Ljubljana in 2009 and was performed by many Slovenian and European choirs. In May 2010, her composition V lovljenju besed med izštevanjem tišine (Searching for Words while Counting out Silence) for flute and soprano was awarded first prize at the Second Biennale of Contemporary Music in Koper, Slovenia. Her recent notable project was MusmA 2011 (Music Masters on Air), a cooperation of ten festivals in partnership with their ten radio stations, where she represented Slovenia. For this occasion she was commissioned a new piece for piano solo. The composition A broken car was performed in six European music festivals in Belgium, Italy, Serbia, Portugal, Hungary and Slovenia."

He fought in the Russian Civil War and in World War II, where he attained the rank of lieutenant general, and was decorated Hero of the Soviet Union. He joined the Red Army in March 1920, and shortly thereafter he participated in the suppression of the Tambov Rebellion. He steadily progressed through the ranks during the interwar years, and in February 1939 he was given command of the 186th Infantry Division of the Urals military district. At the beginning of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Biryukov's division was attached to the 22nd Army and sent to the Western front. Biryukov was wounded in the Battle of Smolensk. After his recovery, he was given command of the 214th Rifle Division, with which he participated in the Battle of Stalingrad. In June 1943, Biryukov was given command of the 20th Guards Rifle Corps, part of the 4th Guards Army, a position he held until the end of the war. In 1945, Biryukov's Corps fought with distinction against the German counteroffensive at Lake Balaton, for which Biryukov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union in April 1945. Biryukov's memoirs were published in 1968 in 100,000 copies. His son, Anatoly Biryukov, became infamous as a serial killer."

He was the younger son of Nakai Shuan (1758 d.), one of the Kaitokudo's two founding leaders, and was influenced by his teacher and mentor Goi Ranju. His intellectualised way of being led to continued engagement with but physical separation from the Kaitokudo. Much is made of his demeanor reflecting his. Often stated as analogous to his floating calligraphic style Riken was vastly different in demeanour to his brother Nakai Chikuzan, although their underlying epistemologies, beliefs and degree of tenacious individualism were similar. They both furthered the work of Goi Ranju and consolidating previous thought around the Kaitokudo school, bringing a level of prestige to the academy. Like his brother Chikuzan, Riken wholeheartedly denounced Ogyū Sorai and contended that all people have potential, to the extent that \"even\" commoners could become scholars, while he also denounced religion and superstition. However, Riken’s particular strain of the dismissal of dreams, and the unverifiable led him to dabble in astronomy, most notably with Asada Goryu. Riken’s scholarship was far broader and is often perceived to transcend the specific question of reconciling the virtue of merchants with contemporary perceptions of merchants."

  "text" : "Nhuchhe Ratna Tuladhar (Devanagari: न्हुछे रत्न तुलाधर) (1888 - 25 December 1950) was a Nepalese democracy activist who was martyred in the freedom struggle against the Rana regime. He lived at Asan Baku Nani, a historical neighborhood in central Kathmandu. His wife's name was Hera Lani Tuladhar. Nhuchhe Ratna had been an anti-Rana activist for a long time, and was a dedicated participant in the revolution that erupted in 1950. In the winter of that year, the decade-old movement to end the rule of the hereditary Rana prime ministers spread to various towns across Nepal. Protests were held frequently. On 25 December 1950, a massive demonstration was brought out in Kathmandu. The police tried to break up the march by beating up the protesters with batons. Nhuchhe Ratna was in the procession and was severely thrashed by the police. He died the same night. His funeral was held the next day, with a throng of marchers joining the procession from his home at Asan to the cremation ground at Karnadeep on the banks of the Bishnumati River. After the funeral, the accompanying crowd stoned and set on fire an army lorry. Troops then fired tear gas shells to disperse the protesters. The Ranas were eventually overthrown in February 1951, and democracy was established in Nepal. The Rana oligarchy ruled Nepal from 1846 until 1951. During this time, the Shah king was reduced to a figurehead and the prime minister and other government positions were hereditary. Jang Bahadur Rana established the Rana dynasty in 1846 by masterminding the Kot massacre in which about 40 members of the nobility including the prime minister and a relative of the king were murdered. The massacre took place at the armory at Kathmandu Durbar Square. Jung Bahadur declared himself prime minister and assumed all powers after that. Tyranny, economic exploitation and religious persecution characterized the Rana period."

  "text" : "Nicholas Alipui is UNICEF's Director of Programmes. He chairs the Global Network for Sustained Elimination of Iodine Deficiency. In 2000, he was UNICEF's representative in Kenya and said that \"the ongoing abduction and abuse of children in Kenya is one of the most serious violations of human rights.\" By 2004, he had become UNICEF's representative in the Philippines and called attention to the lack of official recognition of child pornography as a problem in the country. In this capacity, he also spoke out against the military use of children in the country and denounced infant formula, calling on the country's mothers to breastfeed. In 2008, as Director of Programmes, he met with President of Madagascar Marc Ravalomanana in order to strengthen the ties between Madagascar and the United Nations. In 2010, Alipui said that UNICEF and its partners in the Roll Back Malaria Partnership hoped to put an end to malarial deaths by 2015. In 2011, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) permitted infant formula company Mead Johnson to claim that the addition of docosahexaenoic acid to their infant formula contributes to the development of the visual system in infants, but Alipui opposed the EFSA's decision, saying that \"there can be little doubt that the use of such health claims can mislead parents into thinking that the formulas are as good as, if not better than breast milk.\" He was interviewed in Not My Life, an independent documentary film about human trafficking."

  "text" : "Nayef Hawatmeh (Arabic: نايف حواتمة‎‎, Kunya: Abu an-Nuf) (born November 1938 in Salt, Jordan) is a Palestinian politician of Jordanian origin. His name can be transliterated from the Arabic in many ways; variants include Naif Hawatma, Nayif Hawatme, etc. Hawatmeh hails from a Jordanian tribe and is a Catholic Christian. He is the General Secretary of the Marxist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) since its formation in a 1969 split from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), of which he was also a founder. He was active as a left-wing leader in the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM), which preceded the PFLP. He presently resides in exile in Syria, from which the DFLP receives some support. The DFLP was responsible for the 1974 Ma'alot massacre in which 25 schoolchildren and teachers were killed. Hawatmeh opposed the 1993 Oslo Accords, calling them a \"sell-out\", but became more conciliatory in the late 1990s. In 1999 he agreed to meet with Yassir Arafat (who had signed the accords) and even shook hands with the Israeli President, Ezer Weizmann, at the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan, drawing strong criticism from his Palestinian and Arab peers. In 2004 he was briefly active in a joint Palestinian-Israeli non-governmental attempt to start a coalition of Palestinian groups supporting a two-state solution, and called for a cessation of hostilities in the al-Aqsa Intifada. In 2007 Israel indicated it would allow him to travel to the West Bank for the first time since 1967, in order to participate in a meeting of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)."

He was clerk to Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet when the latter was practising as an advocate in Edinburgh. He was also a friend of Thomas De Quincey. Having embraced the legal profession, he emigrated to New South Wales, and practised for many years as an attorney and solicitor in Sydney. He was a veritable Mæcenas to many needy and struggling literary men in Sydney. Not long before his death he was, on the motion of that great scholar, Dr. Charles Badham, appointed an examiner in the Faculty of Law and a member of the senate of the University of Sydney. He succeeded the late Dr. John Woolley, with whom he was on warm terms of friendship, as president of the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts, and held the position from 1867 to 1873. Stenhouse died on 18 February 1873 in Balmain, New South Wales."

Among the stories she told Mary Haas was one called \"The Woman Who was a Fox\". Sometimes she used the surname Taylor, which she had taken from her second husband. She married four times; she had one son Adam Levi from her first marriage, with her second husband Will Taylor she received land allotments from the Dawes Commission in 1907. She was soon widowed, then married a man named Waters, and by 1920 was again widowed and married Albert Raven about whom little is known. In the 1930s she appears to have been once again widowed. In 1930 she sold her land allotment. She was the biological cousin of the other last speaker of Natchez, Watt Sam, who in Natchez kinship terminology was her classificatory nephew. Among the Natchez, the language was generally passed down matrilineally, but at her death Nancy Raven had no surviving children, her only son Adam Levi having died from tuberculosis at age 20 in 1915."

  "text" : "Niklas Lindgren (born May 18, 1988 in Helsinki) is a Finnish sailor, who specialized in two-person dinghy (470) class. He represented Finland in two editions of the Olympic Games (2008 and 2012), and has also been training for the Helsinki Sailing Club (Helsingfors Segelklubb) throughout most of his sporting career. His father and personal coach Jouko Lindgren shared bronze medals with Georg Tallberg in the same program at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. As of September 2013, Lindgren is ranked no. 304 in the world for two-person dinghy class by the International Sailing Federation. Lindgren made his official debut at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he paired up with crew member Heikki Elomaa in the men's 470 class. The Finnish duo finished twenty-seventh in a ten-round opening series with a mediocre net score of 196, edging out the Turkish brothers Deniz and Ates Çinar by a narrow, two-point gap from the final standings. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Lindgren competed as a crew member in the men's 470 class by finishing twenty-second and receiving a berth from the ISAF World Championships in Perth, Western Australia. Teaming with his older brother and skipper Joonas Lindgren in the opening series, the Finnish duo accumulated a net score of 167 to claim a twenty-first spot in a fleet of twenty-seven boats."

Aronson was born to a Jewish family in what is now Latvia in 1872. He studied art at the Vilna Art School before moving to Paris, where he would live for 50 years. He maintained six galleries in Paris, but kept his prize pieces, including the bust of Rasputin, in his Montparnasse studio. After the German invasion of France in 1940, he was forced to flee the country. When he arrived in New York as a refugee in March, 1941 aboard the Serpa Pinto, he had little more than some photographs of the sculptures that he had left behind in France. He died two years later in his Upper West Side studio at the age of 71."

  "text" : "Norman B.'s career has spanned the worlds of fashion, food, advertising and music. After attending Twickenham School of Graphic Art in London in the late 1960s, he worked as a graphic artist for BBC News, creating black-and-white cards live in the studio. He later began working as Art Director for EMI Records, doing album covers for some of the top recording arts populating \"Swinging London.\" He then left EMI to begin his boutique design agency called Norman Batley Associates. In the late 1970s, Batley crossed the Atlantic Ocean, bought a Cadillac and began exploring America, emerging in Seattle in 1979 as \"Norman B.,\" host of his newly branded, \"Life Elsewhere,\" an alternative rock radio show on the non-profit station, KRAB. \"In the 1970s, KRAB played a critical role in fomenting the early punk rock scene in Seattle by being the first radio station in the Pacific Northwest to broadcast punk music on the air, mostly on its 'Life Elsewhere' program with DJ Norman Batley,\" writes historian Jeff Stevens in \"Counterculture Seattle Remembers.\" For several years, \"Life Elsewhere\" would then cross the country as a popular syndicated program, going out to college stations throughout the U.S. It later became a permanent feature on the now-legendary station, KCMU (KCMU became KEXP 90.3FM in April 2001). During this period, Norman B. held a weekly residency at the alternative Seattle dance venue, “Tugs Belltown”. Along the way, \"Life Elsewhere\" morphed into a weekly show for the ground-breaking pirate station Phoenix Radio out of London. Back in Seattle, Norman B. launched the popular reggae show \"Positive Vibrations\" for KCMU. With a preference for lover’s rock, early dance-hall and rare dub, this untraditional show could be heard blasting out of radios all over Seattle on Saturday mornings. \"'All things considered, 'Positive Vibrations' may be the best show on local radio,\" wrote Bart Becker of The Seattle Weekly. \"The host Norman Batley is a chatty, funny, informative Britisher.\" Norman B.’s first foray into commercial radio was in 1984 for top-rated album-oriented rock station KXRX, where he produced and hosted \"Seattle Blues,\" a Sunday night show that drew a large and devoted following. Bart Becker of The Seattle Weekly wrote that Norman B. was \"stirring up the Sunday night radio waves\" and \"breaking the sound barrier.\" The ratings for \"Seattle Blues\" were so strong that he was lured away to host a midday talk show on KGW in Portland, Oregon, with the KXRX management flying the host back and forth between the two cities. Prompted by the success of \"Seattle Blues,\" KXRX unveiled a new weekly new music show hosted by Norman B. called, \"The Xtra Hour.\" In August 1991, at the peak of Seattle's globally renowned \"grunge\" music wave, Norman B. was hired away from KXRX to become drive-time personality on the newly launched alternative radio station 107.7 KNDD The End. Within six weeks of The End's first broadcast, three albums by local artists — \"Ten\" by Pearl Jam, \"Nevermind\" by Nirvana and \"Badmotorfinger\" by Soundgarden — were released, reaching the top of the Billboard charts, and KNDD was riding the wave. Within a year the new station was \"defying history,\" as reported in the Seattle Times. \"This spring's Arbitron ratings show KNDD in the top three stations among listeners aged 18-34,\" writes Times reporter Ken Hunt. \"The station has become profitable and has become one of the most active sponsors of concerts and club nights around the area.\" The Seattle Weekly wrote that \"In the past six months 'The End' has become one of the hottest stations in the city. Night guy Marco Collins has an annoying habit of cracking up at his own jokes, and morning jock Bill Reid often fashions a more-obnoxious-than-thou attitude, but leonine Brit and gentleman rocker Norman B makes an amiable afternoon companion.\" \"I loved all of the DJs,\" recalls blogger Michael Sutton on the occasion of The End's 20th anniversary. \"Especially Marco Collins, Bill Reid (whom I remembered from KJET), British iconoclast Norman B. (a favorite of mine when he was upsetting KXRX’s bell-bottom crowd with an alternative weekly), and the late Bryan Jones. The eclectic mix of music – from the rave-fueled boogie of Big Audio Dynamite to the metallic roar of Soundgarden to the acoustic-folk melodrama of A Man Called E (later of the Eels) to the radiant glow of the Ocean Blue to the vintage jangle of the Beatles to the brooding intensity of Joy Division – was radio at its finest.\" By the first part of the 1990s, grunge had made Seattle the center of the universe for popular music, The End its chief purveyer in the market, and Norman B. that station's highest-profile on-air personality. In 1993 readers of The Seattle Weekly voted Norman B. \"Best Radio Voice,\" edging out Hall of Fame Seattle Mariners broadcaster Dave Niehaus. His \"smooth British voice adds class,\" wrote Elizabethe Brown of the Bellevue Journal American. Norman B. also became a must-stop interview for recording artists coming through the Pacific Northwest. His unique, easy-going style and gathering reputation as one of the region's top musicologists drew exclusive and often strikingly intimate interviews with stars like David Bowie, Tori Amos, Sheryl Crow and Johnny Lydon, aka Johnny Rotten. He was also given the opportunity on The End to launch the first commercial version of \"Life Elsewhere,\" entitled \"Around The World With Norman B.,\" showcasing music often overlooked or considered unsuitable for radio airplay. In 1997, Norman B. left The End and journeyed across the U.S. again, lured by the highly rated WSJT in Tampa, Florida to anchor that station's format makeover. \"The Norman B. Show,\" co-hosted by Maria Jannello, would premiere that year with a new music-intensive, personality-driven format, and soon gained a large following. But just two years into his three-year contract, and despite strong ratings, the downward trend of local radio across the country soon befell WSJT and the station was forced to cancel \"The Norman B. Show.\""

  "text" : "Nick Ortner is the CEO of The Tapping Solution and author of New York Times Best Selling The Tapping Solution: A Revolutionary System for Stress-Free Living (ISBN 1848509332). Ortner made a documentary called The Tapping Solution, which inspired five online Tapping World Summits. Ortner and his Tapping Solution team have raised over $250,000 for tapping-related charities such as ProjectLight: Rwanda, The Veterans Stress Project, and You Can Thrive!. Ortner and his wife, Brenna, live in Newtown, Connecticut. Psychologist Roger Callahan discovered tapping in the early 1980s, and Gary Craig’s EFT Handbook popularized the movement. It is a combination of ancient Chinese acupressure and claims to be derived from modern psychology, although there is no scientific proof of this claim. It is said to be useful in relieving such conditions as migraines, fibromyalgia, phobias, body aches and posttraumatic stress disorder. EFT involves tapping on meridians while repeating a phrase that relates to the issue the tapper wants resolved. The repeating phrase identifies the MPI, or most pressing issue. Ortner claims that while tapping on these meridians, “we send a calming signal to the amygdala (the fight-or-flight center) in the brain,” telling the brain that the threatening situation isn’t threatening. While the American Psychological Association (APA) does not advocate its use, it has begun granting continuing education credits for psychologists to study tapping. Ortner brought tapping methods to the survivors of the Sandy Hook tragedy, hoping to heal the community of Newtown, Connecticut after the school murders."

  "text" : "Niels Christian Kierkegaard (24 September 1806 - 14 August 1882) was a Danish draftsman and lithographer. Kierkegaard was born in Copenhagen and was a cousin of the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. He attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1821 through 1832. In 1827 he was a student of Johan Ludwig Lund and Heinrich Buntzen. He became a teacher at the Academy and private schools in the years 1833-1861. He exhibited some of his works at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1830-1832, 1834 and 1841. After that he focused on his teaching and less on his own works. Kierkegaard typically signed his works C.K. He died unmarried and was buried at Assistens Cemetery."
