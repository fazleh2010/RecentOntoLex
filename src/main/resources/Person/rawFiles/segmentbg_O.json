  "text" : "Operation Dhritrashtra is an investigation conducted by TV news channel Aaj Tak which exposed financial misappropriation by an NGO run by Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid and his wife Louise. The investigation conducted by Deepak Sharma, Editor, SIT, India Today Group, revealed that Zakir Hussain Memorial Trust forged signatures and stamps of senior officials of several districts in Uttar Pradesh depriving physically challenged people of their due. In the in-depth investigation, Aaj Tak gathered documentary evidence of forgery and false reporting from at least 10 districts in the state. The Zakir Hussain Memorial Trust is registered at Khurshid's residence at 4, Gulmohar Avenue, Jamia Nagar, New Delhi and Louise Khurshid is its chief functionary officer. The trust is registered as an NGO and has been operating in many states and receiving substantial grants from several important ministries of the government of India. Documents in possession of Aaj Tak reveal that a statewide inquiry into these malpractices in a project piloted by the trust was ordered by the UP government on 12 January 2012 following a letter from the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.The ruling party Congress strongly defended Khurshid, but Social activist turned politician Arvind Kejriwal of Aam Aadmi Party began what he called \"indefinite agitation\" until legal action had been taken against the Khurshids.Currently, Uttar Pradesh Economic offence wing is investigating the matter."

Herrigel was born in Walvis Bay and grew up in Swakopmund. He studied economics at University of Heidelberg, and in 1971 obtained a doctoral degree from University of Basel, his thesis was about the demographic and economic development of South-West Africa since 1921. A member of SWAPO since before Independence of Namibia, Herrigel worked as lawyer, businessman, and farmer, before he was appointed Namibia's first Minister of Finance on 21 March 1990. Prominent businessman and then-Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Harold Pupkewitz commented \"Dr Herrigel [is a] man of decision-making abilities and sound judgement\". Herrigel resigned in 1992, reportedly due to differences with president Sam Nujoma over fiscal policy and the procurement of a presidential aircraft. Afterwards Herrigel was on the board of the Bank of Namibia (1998-2008), and on the board of directors of TransNamib (2001-2002). Herrigel and his wife Karin raised two GDR kids as foster children, children that were removed from their parents and brought up in the German Democratic Republic."

  "text" : "Olaf Pedersen (1920–1997) was a \"leading authority on astronomy in classical antiquity and the Latin middle ages\" Olaf Pedersen was born April 8, 1920 in Egtved, Jutland, Denmark. At the University of Copenhagen he studied in Niels Bohr’s institute, graduating in 1943 when the country was occupied by German forces. He began his teaching career in Randers, Jutland, teaching physics. He entered scholarship studying the philosophy and history of ideas. After the war he studied with Etienne Gilson in Paris. Returning to Denmark, he obtained a doctorate for work on Nicole Oresme in 1956, when he became a lecturer at Aarhus University. In 1965 a department for history of science was formed at Aarhus. \"The staff of the department, including Pedersen, taught science as well as history of science, and though this diluted their research it kept them in contact with science and maintained their bona fides among science colleagues.\" In 1967 Pedersen became a professor in this department. He published two books in 1974: A Survey of the Almagest and Early Physics and Astronomy. The latter publication \"supplied the needs of a generation of students in the infant discipline of the history of science.\" Pedersen was active in other organizations: the journal Centaurus, the Steno Museum, the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science, and the International Academy of the History of Science. In 1997 Pedersen published The First Universities which received several scholarly reviews. Ruth Karras wrote, \"this book begins, not as a history of universities, but as a history of learning.\" Her opinion was that a \"more balanced view for both medievalists and non-specialists\" was provided by volume one of A History of the University in Europe (1992), edited by Hilde Ridder-Symoens. A more favorable review was given by DR Jones: [Pedersen] \"develops a complex explanation of the nature of the university, if not a theory of causation. His first universities are shaped by interweaving requirements of subject matter, teaching methods, legal and organizational means, and requirements of society and state.\" A balanced review was given by HEJ Cowdrey: \"Perhaps the most valuable chapters of the book are those which concern the classical inheritance of medieval higher education and the transition from ancient science to monistic learning.\" On the other hand, Cowdrey notes a \"disconcerting number of factual errors\", \"too much attention is given to relatively unimportant topics\", and \"very little account indeed has been taken of scholarly work published since the early 1970s.\"Marcia L. Colish described the book as \"a superficial and shaky sketch of what universities actually taught. He emphasizes the organization, not the content of education.\" Colish finds Pedersen prone to \"repeat and compound factual errors more recently given the descent burial they deserve.\" She suggests other, more reliable, authorities. On the other hand, Ian P. Wei gave the book an enthusiastic review, calling it a \"clear and lively work of synthesis.\" He wrote that the \"main thrust of the book is to present medieval universities as institutions which can only be understood in relation to broader political and social developments. Particular emphasis is laid on the significance of the struggles between popes and emperors, and on Roman law. The book’s greatest strength is its extraordinary breadth of vision.\" After an operation on his heart, Olaf Pedersen died December 3, 1997."

He have served in the German Navy as an army physician, but decommissioned in 1918 due to his ill health. The advice of a physician colleague, the fasting doctor Gustav Riedlin, he began a fasting. After the 19th day on fasting his condition started to improve rapidly. His crippled fingers could straighten again. He then turned with full interest and enthusiasm to the fasting as a therapy. In 1920 he founded his small fasting clinic in Witzenhausen in Germany. The therapy achieved a huge success, so that later in 1935 he founded in Bad Pyrmont his first real sanatorium. He developed the fasting method and described it in his book, \"The Therapeutic Fasting Cure\", published in the same year. In 1953 he founded a new clinic at Überlingen, together with his daughter Maria and son-in-law Helmut Wilhelmi."

  "text" : "Odette Valery (spelled Valéry in French publications), née Helene Vasilardi, (1883–?) was an Italian dancer of Greek parentage. She made her début at La Scala in 1898 at the age of fifteen. She moved to Paris where she danced with the Ballet Excelsior at the Folies Bergère. She came to regard dancing en pointe as \"old-fashioned\" and made her name doing reconstructions of ancient Greek dances in bare feet. Later she portrayed Cleopatra and did an Egyptian dance with a live asp. She was well-educated and spoke French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian as well as some English and she played the piano well. In 1908, she caused a sensation in New York when she danced in the last act of Samson and Delilah at the Manhattan Opera House where she had been engaged by Oscar Hammerstein I. Her dance included the participation of one of three snakes (with fangs removed) which were cared for by their own groom, Robert, whom she had engaged in addition to other servants who travelled with her. In 1910 she was earning $1000 a week when dancing in the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. She owned several automobiles and amassed a fortune in jewellery. She spent lavishly and by 1912, she was destitute. Her money ran out when she had to have an operation and as a result she could not work for an extended period. Although her weekly salary was what a workman earned in a year at the time, she hadn't saved a penny. She was found ill and starving in a cheap boarding house in Notting Hill, London where she was being cared for by her seven-year-old son Gaeton. She had been surviving thus for a year by pawning her jewellery. She was found by a friend who was performing at Hammerstein's London Opera House. The friend took her in and was planning to send her back to her home in France to recover. She returned to Paris and although she was reputed to have had twenty-eight love affairs in one year at the height of her fame, she had few real friends and continued to live in poverty. It was a California heiress, Mrs. Jackson Gouraud, who came to her aid on reading about her plight and gave a fund-raising ball in her honour at Martin's, New York. The hostess wore a live python around her neck for the event."

She was one of the founders of FEMEN in April 2008, along with Anna Hutsol and Alexandra Shevchenko. Shachko had been born in Khmelnytskyi but had moved to Kiev. FEMEN initially protested about issues affecting women students, but rapidly moved on to demonstrating against the sexual exploitation of Ukrainian women. and against sex tourism in 2008. Initially Femen gained attention by demonstrating while dressed in underwear: however, in August 2009 Shachko bared her breasts at a protest in Kiev. Since then FEMEN activists have regularly protested ‘topless’, and broadened their agenda to women's rights and civil rights in Ukraine and around the world. Shachko co-operated with French writer Galia Ackerman who produced a history of 'FEMEN' which was published by Calmann-Lévy in 2013.Since 2013, Oksana Shachko lives in Paris, France, as political refugee. She now concentrates on her art work, and had her first solo exhibition on May 2016 in Galerie Mansart."

Charbonneau started his working life as a sewer cleaner. in Marans, Charente-Maritime. Widowed twice, by Ozanne Lussaud, and Roy in Marans (m. 13 April 1646), he then married Marie-Marguerite Garnier c. 1656. It is recorded that at that time his wife Marie-Marguerite was niece to Marguerite Bourgeoys. He was one of the first settlers of the Île Jésus (today, Laval). He is the ancestor of 35,000 living North Americans, and ancestor of the entire population of Labelle. There are only two surviving records for the family name of Charbonneau: one for Olivier and his wife, landing in 1659, and another for an unrelated man, Jean and his wife, around 1675. Nothing in the record suggests that the two were closely related. It has been estimated that 97% of the Charbonneau families in North America are descended from Olivier Charbonneau and his wife. Descendants of Jean are fewer in number and in New France have tended to cluster in the Vaudreuil and Soulanges area of Quebec near the Ottawa river."

The local hospital administered basic first aid, but nothing else and the injured returned home to die, unable to afford the cost of treatment. That incident shook Omkar and he became determined to not let something like this happen again. Since last six years wearing a saffron kurta (shirt) that says \"Mobile medicine bank for poor patients\", Omkar starts every day at 6 am from his rented home in the Mangalapuri slums and goes door to door in different areas of Delhi asking for unused medicines, which he then distributes to charitable hospitals, NGOs and clinics. Crippled at the age of 12 in a car accident, Omkar walks five or six kilometres per day. He cannot afford the metro rail fare, so travels by buses with the help of his senior citizen pass. In remote areas where buses do not ply, he simply walks. At the end of every collection, Omkar carefully catalogues everything in his binder: the name of the drug, the manufacturer, where he collected it and the expiry date. Omkar makes no profit from these. Omkar lives with his wife and 44-year-old mentally challenged son."

  "text" : "Sir Owen Buckingham (c.1649 – 20 March 1713) was an English merchant, alderman, MP and Lord Mayor of London. He was born the son of George Buckingham, an innkeeper of Stanwell, Middlesex. By 1680 he was a liveryman in the Butchers’ Company of the City of London and by 1692 a liveryman of the Salter's Company. He became involved in local city politics and was a common councilman for London in 1689–90 and 1691–96 and an alderman from 1696 to his death. He was appointed Sheriff of London for 1695–96, knighted the same year and elected Lord Mayor of London for 1704–05. As a result of a promise to manufacture sailcloth in the town he was elected MP for Reading in 1698, and again in 1701, 1702 and 1705, giving up the seat in 1708 in favour of his son, also Owen Buckingham. By virtue of his own enterprise and a succession of favourable marriages he became quite wealthy and by 1706 had purchased the Fettiplace family estates near Reading. He died in 1713. He had married 6 times but was survived by only the one son and heir Owen and two daughters from his first marriage."

The feuding between the Guelf Colleoni and the Ghibelline Suardi in the nearby commune of Bergamo caused them to relocate to the more distant village of Cornello, where Omodeo grew up. Around 1290, after Milan had conquered Bergamo, Omodeo organized 32 of his relatives into the Company of Couriers (Italian: Compagnia dei Corrieri) and linked Milan with Venice and Rome. The recipient of royal and papal patronage, his company was so comparatively efficient that post riders became known as bergamaschi throughout Italy."

  "text" : "Odlanier Rafael Mena Salinas (2 April 1926 – 28 September 2013) was a Chilean general during the military dictatorship of Chile. He was director of the Central Nacional de Informaciones (CNI), a Chilean intelligence agency, between 1977 and 1980. He was convicted for three murders related to the Caravan of Death and was sentenced to six years imprisonment in 2009. From June 2011 onwards he was allowed to stay weekends at his own home. In September 2013 Chilean President, Sebastián Piñera, announced to closure of the Cordillera prison where Mena had been housed. The luxurious conditions at the jail had been criticized, amongst others by former Chilean presidents. According to his lawyer, Mena was worried about moving to a new jail due to a lack of medical attention possibilities. Mena shot himself at his home on 28 September 2013, at the age of 87. His lawyer blamed the suicide on the upcoming relocation of prisoners detained at Cordillera. Before late 1975 Mena had been head of the Army Intelligence Unit (SIM), when he fell out with Manuel Contreras. In 1975 he retired from the Army. Mena was subsequently made ambassador to Panama and eventually Uruguay. During his time in Uruguay he was recalled to Chile to become head of the CNI. From 1983 to 1985 Mena was ambassador to Paraguay."
