  "text" : "Peter Tully (1947-1992), was a jeweller, designer and artistic director, notable for his influence on jewellery design in Australia through the utilisation of found and non-precious materials, as well as his artistic direction of the Sydney Mardi Gras (1982-1986). Tully was born Peter Graig (a spelling mistake in the birth register) Tutungi in Carlton, Melbourne on 17 December 1947. At the age of five Tully's family moved to the beach resort of Lorne in Victoria. Of Arabic/Egyptian origin, his grandparents had migrated to Australia between the wars and anglicised their name to the more acceptable Tully. At the age of 16 Tully moved to Melbourne, first working as a clerk, but later moving into display, making props for Public Benefit Shoes, and later with a German display company. In 1969 Tully, accompanied by the fashion designer Linda Jackson and her partner, the photographer Fran Moore, went to live in Lae in Papua New Guinea. After a year living in Lae the three set out on the hippy trail to Europe, spending much of 1970 and 1971 traveling through South East Asia, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Bali, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. In 1971 Tully arrived in Paris, where he taught English, and undertook trips to the Netherlands and Spain. It was in Paris that Tully became particularly impressed by the collections of African and Oceanic art. In 1972 Tully met up with Linda and Fran in London, before he made his way back to Australia, via Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and India. During this return trip he was particularly impressed by the use of leather and non-precious materials in jewellery in Sudan, and the sale by weight, rather than workmanship, of jewellery in Ethiopia. Meeting up again with Linda and Fran in Thailand, he returned to Melbourne in 1973. In 1973 Tully met the artist and activist David McDiarmid, becoming lovers for the following two years, and remaining friends and collaborators till Tully’s death in 1992. Tully and McDiarmid moved to Sydney in 1975, joining their Melbourne friend and creative collaborators Linda Jackson, who had moved there with her partner Fran Moore in 1973. This period also saw McDiarmid, Tully and Jackson collaborating with Melbourne fashion designer and retailer Clarence Chai and Sydney-based fashion designer and retailer Jenny Kee. After their move to Sydney with Tully and McDiarmid were soon involved with Kee’s fashion store Flamingo Park in Strand Arcade, hand-painting fabrics for Jackson’s dresses. His experience of traditional tribal cultures through many years of travel in New Guinea, Africa and India - along with the vibrant and creative urban sub-cultural 'tribes' he saw New York - stimulated the development of his 'urban tribalwear'. In 1977 Tully held his second one-man exhibition, exhibiting his Australiana-themed jewellery at Paraphethana Gallery ‘Plastic fashion’ by Pat von Wolfe, in The Age, 25 April 1977, Page 10. Tully was undoubtedly the most influential designer involved with the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, through his role as artistic director from 1982-1986 and through the establishment and management of the Workshop. It was in these roles that Tully greatly contributed to the transformation of the Mardi Gras from a political march to cultural event. He once said of the legendary Paradise Garage disco in New York: 'It was about 85% black and very exciting. They played the best music I'd never heard and the people dressed. Even though they didn't dress expensively, they had lots of style. They could wear a paper bag and look like a million dollars. And they really impressed me. So that was the impetus to get into costume.' Peter Tully died in Paris in August 1992 from an AIDS-related illness, he was 45."

He subsequently moved to Walvis Bay where he participated in the circles critical of the apartheid regime. Nanyemba left Namibia in 1962 to participate in the anti-apartheid movement. He served as a Swapo representative in East Africa, and was posted in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. He was subsequently elected Secretary of Defence. He was killed on 1 April 1983 in a car accident in Lubango in the Angola's Huila Province, when his car collided with a petrol tanker in Lubango, Angola. His remains were repatriated from Angola 31 years after his death along with those of other liberation stalwarts such as; Walde Homateni Kaluenja, Isak Shikongo, Natalia Ndahambelela Shikangala Mavulu and Augustus Nghaamwa. A primary school was built and named after him in Angola in 2005, also a rehabilitation of the cemetery and a monument outside Lubango at the cost of N$ 8,5 million."

  "text" : "Major Percy Horace Gordon Powell-Cotton, FZS, FRGS, FRAI, JP (20 September 1866 – 26 June 1940) was an explorer, hunter and early conservationist, most noted for the creation of the Powell-Cotton Museum in the grounds of his home, Quex Park in Birchington-on-Sea, Kent, England. Powell-Cotton is noted for bringing an extraordinary number of animal specimens back from his travels across Africa, potentially creating the largest collection of game ever shot by one man. Despite this, Powell-Cotton was an early conservationist, helping categorise a wide number of species across the globe. His two daughters, Antoinette Powell-Cotton and Diana Powell-Cotton shared his passion for conservation, pursuing archaeology and anthropology respectively. Powell-Cotton made a large number of films (Powell-Cotton filmography) including ethnographic, documentary and wildlife films (Powell-Cotton Ethnographic Films)."

  "text" : "Harry Peter Smollett, OBE (1912–1980), born Hans Peter Smolka and sometimes continuing to use that name as a nom de plume even after he changed it by deed poll, was a journalist for the Daily Express and later a Central Europe correspondent for The Times. During the Second World War, Smollett became head of the Russian section at Britain's Ministry of Information and was responsible for organising pro-Soviet propaganda. He was later identified as a Soviet agent. Born in Vienna, he came to Britain in 1933 as an NKVD agent codenamed \"ABO\". Although he changed his name to Smollett on becoming a naturalized British subject in 1938, he returned to using the surname Smolka when he returned to Vienna after the war. According to the Mitrokhin Archive, Smollett had been recruited by Kim Philby. George Orwell included him on the list of those who \"in my opinion are crypto-communists, fellow-travellers or inclined that way and should not be trusted as propagandists\" that he gave to the Information Research Department in 1949 as \"almost certainly agent of some kind\" and \"a very slimy person\" (see Orwell's list). Timothy Garton Ash stated that Smollett \"was 'almost certainly' the civil servant on whose advice the London publisher Jonathan Cape rejected Orwell's Animal Farm as an unhealthily anti-Soviet text\". Graham Greene's biographer, Michael Shelden, refers to the inside joke that appears in the film The Third Man (1949), filmed in Vienna. Greene wrote the screenplay and used the name Smolka for a bar because Smolka/Smollett had given uncredited advice on the filming."

In 1930, Raman referred to the immense contributions made by Dr. P Krishnamurthy in the Nobel lecture: I should also like to draw attention to the work of Krishnamurti, who has traced a remarkable dependence of the intensity of the spectral lines observed in scattering on the nature of the chemical bond, and followed the transition from the homopolar to the heteropolar type of chemical combination. Krishnamurti’s observation that the paramagnetism of crystals apparently influences the observed intensity of the displaced lines is one of the most remarkableever made in this new field of research.\" Krishnamurthy and Raman started a company called Travancore Chemical & Manufacturing in 1943, with Raman as the Chairman and Krishnamurthy as the Managing Director. They established 4 factories across South India and the company was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. For over 5 decades, the company was a leader in the manufacture of copper sulphate, sodium chlorate and other chemicals."

Crassus's brother (probably his younger brother) was Gaius Licinius Crassus (consul 168 BC), and his nephew was Gaius Licinius Crassus, tribune of the plebs in about 145 BC. However, his relationship to the consuls Licinius Varus and the Pontifex Maximus Publius Licinius Crassus are not known. Licinius adopted as his son and his heir, his sister Licinia's second son Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus. This son was born a Mucius Scaevola, son of another consul Publius Mucius Scaevola, who attained the consulship in 175 BC, and who was brother of another consul (174 BC) and son of a praetor who had died in the Second Punic War. It was the adoptive son who also became a Pontifex Maximus and who was a political ally of the Gracchi."

Moreover, as a leading university administrator, he served in various roles of university administration including posts as dean and acting-vice chancellor of UCLA, and later serving as university president of San Francisco State College in the mid-1960s, until his retirement."

  "text" : "Peder Morset (4 April 1887 – 19 May 1943) was a Norwegian teacher and resistance member. He was born in Selbu in Sør-Trøndelag, Norway. He was the son of Ole Henriksen Morset (1864-1935) and Ingborg Berntine Petersdatter (1864-1947).He received teacher training and began as a teacher in his village. In 1913, Morset married Marit Stugudal (1893–1948). The couple had seven sons. During the German occupation of Norway, Morset came into contact with a group organized by Henry Thingstad in Trondheim. Chairing the local chapter of the Norwegian Teachers' Union (Norges Lærerlag), he was also the local representative of the teachers' civil resistance. Several of his sons were also deeply involved in the resistance. Morset and his family helped refugees to flee to Sweden. However his resistance group was infiltrated by agents of Henry Rinnan and Morset was arrested, sentenced to death and executed at Kristiansten Fortress in Trondheim in 1943. After the liberation, Morset was buried on 29 May 1945 along with the ashes of his son Niklas. The six surviving sons carried the coffin. The fate of Morset and his family was treated by journalist Per Hansson in his 1963 book – og tok de enn vårt liv ."

Benoit served as a Republican State Senator from Maine's 19th District, representing part of Sagadahoc County, including the population centers of Bath and Topsham from 2006 to 2008. In 2006, she challenged incumbent State Senator Arthur Mayo III. Mayo had been a registered Republican, but switched parties shortly after his reelection in 2004. After a spirited campaign, Benoit beat Mayo. She was the only Republican to beat an incumbent Senate Democrat in 2006. As a State Senator, Benoit help lead the charge for changing Maine's adoption law to allow adoptees to see their original birth certificate. In most states, original birth certificates are sealed. After this law went into effect Benoit, herself an adoptee, viewed her original birth certificate and discovered two of her colleagues in the legislature – State Senator Bruce Bryant and State Representative Mark Bryant – were her nephews. In 2008, Goodall defeated Benoit for re-election by 162 votes. She outperformed U.S. John McCain's presidential campaign in her district, with Senator McCain losing District 19 by 3,492 votes to U.S. Senator Barack Obama. In 2013, Goodall resigned after his appointment to a federal post and Benoit announced she would seek the Republican nomination for the special election. She was defeated by Democrat Eloise Vitelli in the August election. In 2011, Benoit wrote a children's book, Baxter in the Blaine House, about the Jack Russell Terrier mix of Maine Gov. Paul LePage."

  "text" : "Patrick Bet-David is an American entrepreneur and financial adviser. In the late 1980s he fled Iran with his mother during the Iran–Iraq War; they lived for two years in a refugee camp in Germany before immigrating to the US in 1990, when Bet-David was 12 years old. After high school he enlisted in the US army and served with the 101st Airborne Division. After leaving the army he got a job at Morgan Stanley. After a dinner event with George Will in 2009, he launched a website called Saving America and later a radio show broadcast in Los Angeles, to encourage people to be entrepreneurial and to educate people about fiscal responsibility. Later that year he opened a financial services agency offering term and permanent insurance, debt settlements, and 401(k) rollovers into indexed annuities called PHP Agency, which stood for \"People Helping People\". In 2013 he gave interviews advising people to avoid debt, and based on the housing market at that time, not to buy houses but instead rent, and to use any wealth they had acquired to start a business. In 2015 he gave an interview advising people graduating from high school to avoid the debt of going to college unless they had a clear professional goal of being a doctor or lawyer or want to play professional sports, and advised them instead to travel or intern for a year. Bet-David has published two books, The 25 Laws for Doing the Impossible (2011) and The Next Perfect Storm (2012). The former is a self-help book about realizing your goals, and the latter tries to teach people how to profit from bubbles like the real estate market in the 2000s and the stock market of the late 1990s."

He bestowed an important collection of drawings to his native town of Épinal. Oulmont received his medical degree in 1873 and was appointed  Jean-Martin Charcot's house officer in 1877. In 1878 he defended his thesis on athetosis, closely followed by papers which included the first description of double athetosis. Although athetosis was known as \"Hammond's disease,\" after William Alexander Hamilton ( 1828-1900), Oulmont presented a much earlier description written in 1853 by his mentor, Charcot, who classified the disorder as a form of chorea. Oulmont's name is associated with a number of disorders including diabetic neuropathy, Mercury toxicity in tics, and facial hemiplegia. He died November 3, 1917 in Paris."

One of his life's ambitions was to make the mandolin popular, and he made continental music tours for that purpose. His last performance was in London in 1895. Armanini's success in England was mixed; the journals of the time stated that his cadenzas and improvisations were little short of marvellous. However, it also called him a \"maestro of the very highest order\"—\"an artist without an equal as an executant, he had no rival, and probably will have no successor, his scale passages, part playing, pizzicato, double stopping with left hand, and marvellous rapidity proclaimed him the Paganini of the mandolin.\" In 1895 he retired from public life and lived at Bordeaux. He was stricken by an illness that same year and never recovered."

  "text" : "Philip J. Bone (1873 in Luton – 17 June 1964 in Luton) was an English mandolinist and guitar player in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While his day-to-day work was as a teacher and music dealer, he is remembered today as the author of the book The Guitar and Mandolin: Biographies of Celebrated Players and Composers for These Instruments, published by Schott and Augener, London, 1914. He was also a Medallist, Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, London. Other honours given him include being a medallist at the International Music Contests in Bologne, medallist in the International Music Contest in France (1st Prize Honours), and medalist of the I.U.M. in London. He conducted of the Luton Mandolin orchestra. His book The Guitar and Mandolin is comprehensive look at the composers and players of these two instruments up to 1914. He advertised his book on his company letterhead in 1915, saying it was \"the only compendium of invaluable information concerning these instruments\", and \"lives of 300 of the most celebrated players and composers. Facts hitherto unpublished.\" In writing the book, Bone did not include people living at the time, as he felt that it was the job of future historians to decide who would be notable. The book contains biographies for composers and musicians throughout western Europe. Many of those in his book who were prominent have been forgotten today, and the book has information not readily available elsewhere. Later in 1953, Bone wrote to Vahdah Olcott-Bickford, who had assisted him with his book. He told her he had continued the research since his book was printed and was trying to get another edition published with his new information. He was having difficulty finding a publisher willing to take a risk on a new edition."

His father died on the voyage out, and his mother settled in Ipswich, Queensland, where he was apprenticed to a carpenter. Subsequently he was employed in the Ipswich railway workshops until, at the age of twenty-one, he formed the idea of becoming a barrister. Relinquishing his trade, he devoted himself to study. He was admitted to the Queensland Bar in September 1874 and practised with success. In February 1878 he was appointed Crown Prosecutor for the Central District of Queensland and, on the death of Justice Charles Mein in 1890, a Puisne Judge. Real retired as a judge in 1922, aged 76, and practised as a consulting barrister, without great success. Real died in 1928 and was buried in Toowong Cemetery."

  "text" : "Paon de Roet sometimes Payne Roet of Guienne (c.1310-1380), and also referred to as Sir Gilles de Roet, was a herald and knight from Hainaut who was involved in the early stages of the Hundred Years War. He became attached to the court of King Edward III of England through the king's marriage to Philippa of Hainaut. He is most notable for the fact that he became the ancestor of the monarchs of England because his daughter Katherine married John of Gaunt. Her children, given the surname \"Beaufort\", became the forebears of the Tudor dynasty through Margaret Beaufort. Another of his daughters also made a notable marriage, to the poet Geoffrey Chaucer."

It is possible that during his lifetime he was known as Gottfried Gaertner, and that \"Philipp\" was added after his death. That may have been because it was the custom of the time to add the name of his father after death, or because \"Dr. Phil. Gottfired Gaertner\" on his death notice was interpreted as Dr. Philipp instead of \"Doctor of Philosophy\"."

Johnson, Shorty Haughton, Claude Dunson, Snooky Young, Freddie Webster, Gerald Wilson, and Jake Porter. After a brief spell with Roy Eldridge's band, he joined Red Saunders' band in New York in September 1946. The band later took up residency at Chicago's Club DeLisa, and Kilbert would remain with the Saunders band until January 1952, when he left to form his own band. In December 1946, he was in a line-up led by Coleman Hawkins, recording for Prestige, with Fats Navarro, Milt Jackson, JJ Johnson, Hank Jones, Curley Russell and Max Roach. In 1947, he led an orchestra backing Clarence Samuels recording for Aristocrat. In 1954, he was a member of the Horace Henderson big band and in 1955 and 1956, he participated in a series of \"battles of the saxes\" with Tom Archia at the C&C Lounge. In 1960, having recorded the previous year for bandleader Quincy Jones, featuring as soloist on some of the tracks, he toured Europe with Jones' big band (with fellow altoist Phil Woods)."

Over the last three decades, his music has moved from post-punk and classically bent post-minimal styles, through Balinese-inspired gamelan and microtonality, to ambient, electronic soundscapes involving many layers of acoustic and electronically amplified instruments. Throughout its evolution, his music has consistently contained a \"...a driving and rather harsh energy redolent of rock, as well as a clean sense of melodicism...intricate cross-rhythms rarely let up...\" Known as a producer and co-producer of live musical events, he has presented many concerts of his own and other composers, including a 2013 Guinness World Record-breaking performance of 175 electronic keyboards in NYC. He is the creator of International Strange Music Day (August 24) and the pioneer of the electric guitar procession Tilted Axes."

  "text" : "Petru II Muşat (d. 1391) was Voivode (prince) of Moldavia from 1375 to 1391, the son of an unknown son of Bogdan I, the first ruler from the dynastic House of Bogdan. During his reign, he maintained good relationships with his neighbours, especially Poland. On 27 September 1387 at Lwów, he paid homage to the Polish king Władysław II Jagiełło, making Moldavia a Polish fief (which it remained until 1497). In 1388, he received Pokuttya as a pawn for 3,000 silver rubles he lent to the Polish king. Petru also acted as an intermediary in the negotiations between the Wallachia voivode Mircea cel Bătrân and the Polish king that resulted in the treaties signed by the two parts in 1389 and 1390. The first Russian-Moldavian diplomatic contacts also date from his reign. He was married twice. From his first wife he had son Roman. In 1388 he married to Olga, daughter of Janusz I, Prince of Masovia. From his second wife he had son Ivaşcu. Petru I founded the Neamţ citadel and Neamţ Monastery, and built the Holy Trinity Church in Siret. He also fixed the see of Moldova at Suceava and maintained Bishop Iosif at Cetatea Albă, contrary to the wishes expressed by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, resulting in his excommunication. During his reign, a number of important coins were minted; the ones attributed to him, known so far, are: groschen and far more rare half-groschen made of silver. Their design became the standard for coins minted by later Moldavian rulers. Obverse: Aurochs head, frontal view, a star between the horns, a rose on the right, a crescent on the left. In some cases, the rose is at left and the crescent at right. Sometimes, the aurochs holds a fleur de lys in its mouth. The legend is in Latin: SIMPETRI WOIWOD. Reverse: Coat of arms, a shield with three or four bars in the right half, and in the left half a variable number of fleurs de lys (seven to one). The legend is SIMOLDAVIENSIS."

He began his career heavily influenced by Juan de Juni, Gaspar Becerra and Esteban Jordan, who had worked in Medina de Rio Seco, so his work is considered a stylistic continuation of them. He moved to Cuellar in 1580, where he opened a workshop and married Ana Velazquez, with whom he had two children. In Cuéllar, Pedro formed a very close professional relationship with the Maldonado Family (Julian and Gabriel), local painters who worked in much of the province of Segovia and the closest areas of Valladolid. He returned to Medina de Rio Seco where he died in 1595. His brothers and nephews continued the sculpting business. The sculptures thereafter were painted and decorated by the Maldonado family."

One of the most popular festivals of ancient Greece were the Olympic Games, participation in which was the great dream of Pythagoras. In 588 BC, although he was still a boy, decided to give the oath of sixteen months' training to take part in the games. During the 48th Olympiad, Pythagoras of Samos was excluded from the boys' boxing contest and was mocked for being effeminate, but he went on to the men's contest and successfully defeated all his opponents. So, his dream came true."

  "text" : "Panagiota \"Peny\" Karagkouni (Greek: Παναγιώτα Καραγκούνη; born July 1, 1993) is a Greek beach volleyball player. Her debut appearance in beach volleyball tournaments was in 2013, when she replaced Maria Tsiartsiani as Vicky Arvaniti's partner. In her first season in beach volleyball, and despite being the new member of the team, she managed (with Vicky Arvaniti) to finish 5th in the finals of the European Championship held in Klagenfurt, Austria hosted by CEV. Her greatest achievement to date has been the silver medal she gained with Vassiliki Arvaniti at the XVII Mediterranean Games held at Mersin, Turkey. In addition, on 28 July 2013 she won the Greek Championship held in Athens and she – along with Arvaniti – was the player who would represent the Greek National Team in all international competitions for the following year. She reached her first important FIVB milestone on 14 December 2013, by obtaining the 9th position at the FIVB Beach Volleyball Durban Open for the first time in her career, this being the greatest achievement for the team since she partnered up with Vicky Arvaniti. In April 2014, Maria Tsiartsiani returned to action after a successful surgery on the right shoulder and only a few months after she had given birth to her first child, and she teamed up with her ex-teammate Arvaniti. Consequently, Peny took part at the Continental Cup Round 1 hosted by CEV as being the second Greek team partnering Evangelia Christou this time and managed to obtain the first place, which gave the Greek national teams the opportunity to compete at the second stage of the tournament that would lead to the Olympic Games of Rio 2016. Soon after this, she teamed up with Pigi-Anna Metheniti (with whom she played until late 2015) and a few weeks later they managed to finish 2nd in the Greek Championship behind Arvaniti/Tsiartsiani. During the second season of the Greek duo, they took part in the first European Games held in Baku where they managed to finish 17th in their international debut. Moreover, during the same year, they finished 2nd in the Greek Championship, losing 2-1 to Arvaniti/Tsiartsiani at a \"repeat\" final as of 2014. Also, they took part in two tournaments for the Balkan Championship in Burhaniye and Thessaloniki finishing third and second respectively. Finally, she competed in the CEV Continental Cup Rounds 3 and 4 where she got the second place, getting a ticket for the finals of the competition which will be held in Stavanger, Norway in June 2016."

After the death of his father at 21 September 1559, the boyars try to take the throne of the family. Between 25 September and 24 October 1559, three battles took place between the boyars and the remaining family of Mircea the Shepherd. The first battle, from the village Românești, was won by the boyars, only to lose the second battle, of Șerpătești. The decisive battle took place at Boiani where, Peter, helped by the ottomans, won. On 24 October 1559, he was confirmed by the Ottoman Empire as the new ruler of Wallachia. Peter the Younger established the Plumbuita Monastery in 1560 and continued his father's work on restoring the Curtea Veche church and the Snagov Monastery. Trying to get hold of the riches of the family, the Ottoman Empire, through a representative, managed to send the prince in exile along with his mother, Lady Chiajna in 1568. Peter the Younger arrived in Constantinople on 31 May and was taken to the Seven Towers fortress, where he was stripped of his riches. On 19 August 1568, Peter the Younger died of poisoning at only 21 years old."

  "text" : "Beryl Patricia Hall, née Woodhouse (1917–2010) (cited in ornithological literature as B.P. Hall and in self-published works as Pat Hall), was a British ornithologist, associated with the Natural History Museum. She is best known for her work on African birds. Pat grew up in Epson, Surrey, born in an upper-middle-class family. Her ambition was to study mathematics at Cambridge but she failed to pursue it due to opposition from her parents. Forced to spend several years at home, she took to watching birds and then decided to sign up for the Women's Legion in 1939. Her work involved teaching ambulance driving and precautions during Air Raids. She got engaged to John Hall, a lieutenant in the army who was posted in the Middle East. She was initially posted to South Africa and she transferred to Egypt in March 1941 allowing her to marry John. After the war she returned to the UK and in 1947, following a failed marriage, she took up a position as a scientific associate at the bird room of the Natural History Museum. She then joined an expedition to southern and south-western Africa in 1949 along with James Macdonald and Colonel F. O. Cave. Working for half a year, they collected 1300 specimens of nearly 200 species of bird. She went on several self-funded expeditions in 1953 to northern Bechuanaland and another to Angola in 1957. She led the Harold Hall expedition to Australia based on her experience in arid zones in 1965. She worked on a number of African bird groups including the francolins. Her major work was An Atlas of Speciation in African Passerine Birds (1970) in collaboration with R.E. Moreau. She also wrote two books based on her war years in Africa What a Way to Win a War (1978) and A Hawk from a Handsaw (1993). Along with Derek Goodwin, she also wrote a series of nonsense poems Bird Room Ballads. Pat was a member of the Committee of the British Ornithologists’ Club from 1955 to 1964 and an Assistant Editor of the Ibis from 1971 to 1973. She received the Gill Memorial Medal and the Stamford Raffles Award in 1971 as well as a BOU medal in 1973. She was invited to preside over the 4th Pan African Ornithological Congress in 1976. A species named by Russian-born ornithologist Alexandre Prigogine (1913-1991) after her as Eurillas hallae (\"Hall's greenbul\" ) is now considered to be a melanistic specimen of Eurillas virens."

  "text" : "Erekle (Georgian: ერეკლე; 1568 – 1589) was a Georgian prince (batonishvili) of the royal house of Kakheti, son of King Alexander II of Kakheti by his wife Tinatin Amilakhvari. According to the 18th-century Georgian historian Prince Vakhushti, Erekle, soon after Alexader's accession to the throne of Kakheti, took offence at his brother Davit and clandestinely repaired for the Ottoman court in Constantinople. The Safavid Iranian shah Tahmasp I saw this as a renege on the Kakhetians' pledge of loyalty. Advancing with his army into Karabakh, the shah summoned Alexander to his camp. Through the machinations of Prince Cholokashvili, the Kakhetians managed to divert the shah's attention to the political intrigues in the principality of Samtskhe, which was invaded and ravaged by the Iranians in 1574. In 1578, when Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha's Ottoman army marched into Georgia, Alexander II of Kakheti accepted the sultan's suzerainty and helped Lala Pasha to conquer Shirvan. Alexander's son Erekle was briefly appointed by the Ottomans a governor of sanjak of Shaki in Shirvan, which had hitherto been ruled by Alexander's alienated brother Isa-Khan on the shah of Iran's behalf. Erekle reappears in the historical records as a signatory, together with his father Alexander II and brothers, Davit and Giorgi, to the oath of allegiance to Feodor I of Russia on 28 September 1587, a culmination of the mission of the Russian envoy Rodion Birkin, which, however, did not bring about any tangible changes in the regional political climate."

  "text" : "Perry Fellwock (born 1947) is a former National Security Agency (NSA) analyst and whistleblower who revealed the existence of the NSA and its worldwide covert surveillance network in an interview, using the pseudonym Winslow Peck, with Ramparts in 1971. At the time that Fellwock blew the whistle on ECHELON, the NSA was a nearly unknown organization and among the most secretive of the US intelligence agencies. Fellwock revealed that it had a significantly larger budget than the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Fellwock was motivated by Daniel Ellsberg's release of the Pentagon Papers. Today, Fellwock has been acknowledged as the first NSA whistleblower. ECHELON is the name popularly given to the signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection and analysis network operated on behalf of the five signatory states (so called \"Five Eyes\" FVEY) to the UKUSA Security Agreement. According to information in a European Parliament document \"On the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system)\", ECHELON was ostensibly created to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies during the Cold War in the early 1960s. Because of the Fellwock revelations, the U.S. Senate United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (\"Church Committee\" as it was chaired by Frank Church) introduced successful legislation in 1973 to stop the NSA from spying on American citizens. Speaking about ECHELON, Frank Church said: \"...[T]hat capability at any time could be turned around on the American people and no American would have any privacy left, such [is] the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter. There would be no place to hide. If this government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back, because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capability of this technology... I don't want to see this country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision, so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.\" The Church Committee hearings and other congressional hearings into abuses by the Nixon Administration by a committee chaired by Sam Ervin helped lead to the passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\") Pub.L. 95–511, 92 Stat. 1783, 50 U.S.C. ch. 36 in 1978. FISA prescribes procedures for the physical and electronic surveillance and collection of \"foreign intelligence information\" between \"foreign powers\" and \"agents of foreign powers\" (which may include American citizens and permanent residents suspected of espionage or terrorism) in 1978. After the September 11 attacks, the law was amended, enabling President George W. Bush to expand the warrantless surveillance of American citizens."

Occasionally he can be seen on TV with solo performances and readings. He took additional lessons by Arthur Hewlett and specialised on Sinus Tone Control, a sound technique by Ernest George White, which puts special emphasis for singers on using the resonances in the head. In this method he gives lessons for speakers and singers as a professional voice teacher. He performed with the male trio Canterbury Clerkes for 25 years.In 2000 he founded the mixed voice quintet Quodlibet, with which he made three albums. Besides that he plays the organ at different churches and conducts and coaches choirs. Peter Giles is also known for his publications on the subject of countertenor."

Later he became a military chaplain with the troops of the Spanish Royal Governor, Ramón Rodil. During the siege of the fortress Real Felipe in the city of Callao after the Battle of Ayacucho there was a conspiracy made against Rodil by some of the Royal soldiers. The plot was discovered and Rodil sentenced the conspirators to death. They were allowed to confess to Father Marieluz before being shot. After the execution of the plotters Rodil doubted whether he had convicted all members of the plot and, thinking that the executed ones would have revealed everything in confession to Father Marieluz, he tried to force the confessor to disclose to him what he had heard under the holy seal by threatening him to be shot likewise, if he would not obey. But Father Marieluz remained steadfast and thus died a martyr in the evening of 23 September 1825."

He studied at the University of Lille, receiving his degree in natural sciences in 1903 and his doctorate of sciences in 1909. In 1910 he became a lecturer in paleontology and director of the Lille \"coal museum\". In 1927 he attained the chair of paleobotany, a distinction created especially for Bertrand. From 1938 to 1944 (year of death), he served as chair of \"Anatomie comparée des végétaux actuels et fossiles\" at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris. His work largely dealt with the comparative anatomy of fossil plants, comparative morphological investigations of living and fossil plants, and studies involving Carboniferous biostratigraphy. He made significant contributions in his research on the structure of early ferns and fernlike plants. He is credited with defining the taxa Etapteris and Metaclepsydropsis. The standard author abbreviation P.Bertrand is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Pavel V. Maksakovsky (1900 – 2 November 1928) was a Russian economist and Bolshevik. Maksakovsky was born in 1900 in Ilevo, in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. His father and brothers were metalworkers, but in 1912 their factory closed down. After four years working on the land, they moved to Ekaterinoslav, Ukraine. After the Rada declared independence in 1917, Maksakovsky joined the underground resistance. He joined the Bolshevik Party in 1918, voluneering with the Red Army when it reached Ekaterinoslav in 1919. He was captured by Anton Denikin's White Army and sentenced to death, but managed to escape. From 1920 to 1924, Maksakovsky worked as an instructor at a Bolshevik party school in Sverdlovsk, Ukraine and briefly at the Plekhanov Institute before he was invited to join the Institute of Red Professors in 1925. During this period, he suffered recurring bouts of illness, which ultimately led to his death at the age of 28 in 1928. His only known work, apart from an article published in the journal Bolshevik in 1928, is The Capitalist Cycle: An Essay on the Marxist Theory of the Cycle, which was published posthumously in 1929 in 3.100 copies by the Communist Academy. An English translation and introduction by Richard B. Day at the University of Toronto Mississauga was published in Historical Materialism Volume 10, Issue 3 in 2002. The translation was later republished in hardcover by Brill Academic Publishers in 2004 and in paperback in 2009 by Haymarket Books. A Swedish translation of the essay was published in the journal Fronesis in 2014."

Casas' last book was \"La Cocina de Mama: The Great Home Cooking of Spain\" in 2005. Casas was born Penelope Fexas to Greek immigrant parents, Antonia and Achilles Fexas, on May 25, 1943, in Whitestone, Queens, New York City. Her only brother, Tom Fexas, was a yacht designer. She met her husband, Luis Casas, while studying abroad in Spain as a Vassar College student during the 1960s. She has also studied at the University of Madrid.

Best known for his term as artistic director of Theatre Passe Muraille in Toronto, Ontario from 1970 to 1982, Thompson was known for pioneering techniques of collective creation, in which actors, playwrights and directors would collaborate on the creation of a play through field research and acting improvisations. Plays on which Thompson was credited as a primary or collaborating writer during this era included Doukhobors (1970), The Farm Show (1972), 1837: The Farmers' Revolt (1973, with Rick Salutin), I Love You, Baby Blue (1975), Far As the Eye Can See (1977, with Rudy Wiebe) and Maggie and Pierre (1980, with Linda Griffiths). Thompson later served as director general of the National Theatre School in Montreal, Quebec from 1987 to 1994. He continues to direct theatre productions for Theatre Passe Muraille, Centaur Theatre, Alberta Theatre Projects, the Blyth Festival, Native Earth Performing Arts and De-ba-jeh-mu-jig Theatre Group."

  "text" : "Mary Priscilla \"Prissy\" Hickerson (born August 24, 1951), is a Republican member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from District 1, which includes Texarkana and Miller County in southwestern Arkansas. She has held this seat since January 2011, when she ran without opposition. Prior to 2009, Hickerson served for ten years under appointment from Governor Mike Huckabee as a member of the Arkansas Highway Commission. She is one of only two women to have chaired the panel. As commissioner, Hickerson worked for funding of Loop 245 and the construction of Arkansas Highway 549, which will become part of Interstate 49 from Texarkana south to near the Louisiana border. For her contributions, Loop 245 is named the \"Hickerson Highway\". Hickerson worked to obtain construction of a highway rest area outside Texarkana for the benefit of eastbound travelers. When a fellow highway commissioner tried to divert $47 million away from Texarkana projects, Hickerson fought back successfully for their inclusion. Hickerson was an Arkansas delegate to the 2004 and 2008 Republican national conventions. Hickerson won her House seat in the general election held on November 2, 2010; she succeeded the term-limited Democrat, Steve Harrelson, who ran successfully for the Arkansas State Senate for a single two-year term before he was unseated in 2012 by the Republican Jimmy Hickey, Jr., of Texarkana. Hickerson was reelected without opposition in 2012. Hickerson serves on three House committees: (1) State Agencies and Governmental Affairs, (2) Public Transportation, and (3) Advanced Communications and Information Technology. She is a member too of the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee. Hickerson is opposed to abortion, having voted to ban the practice after twenty weeks of gestation or whenever fetal heartbeat is determined. She voted to declare the death of a fetus in certain situations a felony. She voted to require photo identification for voting. Those measures required the override of the vetoes of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe. Hickerson voted for the implementation of dress codes for public achools. Hickerson graduated from Watkins Business Institute (location unknown) and attended the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, Tennessee. She and her husband, Randall Ray Hickerson (born 1950), a dentist, have one son, Christopher Randall Hickerson."

  "text" : "Paul Yandell (September 6, 1935 - November 21, 2011, age 76) was an American guitar player from Mayfield, Kentucky. Yandell played fingerstyle, a style he learned to play from his neighbors, influenced by Chet Atkins and Merle Travis. In 1955 he was hired by The Louvin Brothers and performed and recorded with them. From 1959 to 1961 he served in the US Army and on his return was a touring musician with Kitty Wells, Johnnie Wright, George Hamilton IV, and Jerry Reed. From 1975 until the late 1990s, Yandell worked with Chet Atkins doing shows, recordings, and TV appearances, and produced an instructional video called Fingerstyle Legacy. After Atkins died in 2001, Yandell recorded seven CDs and was a consultant for guitars for Gretsch, most notably the limited edition stereo version of the Gretsch 6120, a model used by Atkins in the 1950s. He died in Hendersonville, Tennessee, of cancer, at age 76. In 2011, Atkins' daughter Merle Atkins Russell bestowed the light-hearted Certified Guitar Player (CGP) degree on Yandell. She then declared no more CGPs would be allowed by the Atkins estate."

  "text" : "Pisana Conaro (died 10 March 1769), was a Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Alvise Giovanni Mocenigo (r. 1763–1779). Pisana Conaro was the daughter of Federico Conaro and married 5 October 1739. Upon his election as doge, the spouse demanded to reintroduce the ceremony of the Solemn Entry of the dogaressa, as well as the other ceremonies surrounding her, rituals which had been abolished during the 17th century. The 22 April 1763, dogaressa Pisana therefore celebrated her entry followed by all the traditional rituals, such as to receive the representatives from the city guilds, with the exception of the coronation. These ceremonies attracted much attention and were seen as a sign that the former grandness of Venice should return. Pisana was described as a simple and retiring person, more interested in her household than in her role as dogaressa, who abhorred pomp and became popular for her involvement in charity. In 1766, she presided at the marriage of her son to Francesca Grimani. She was deeply affected by the early death of her daughter-in-law, and lost interest in public life. She spent much of her time at the country villa in Cordiguano, where she was popular as a good employer. In the work \"On the Character, Customs, and Female Mind\", the French academician Thomas described her: \"Let us mention a Venetian matron who was really wise, pious, and gifted with dignity as well as excellent qualities. She was not old when she died. People will at once perceive that I am alluding to Pisana Cornaro Mocenigo, whose nobleness of character, piety, and learning were unrivalled, and besides amusing herself with astronomical observations and natural history, took a singular pleasure in the study of anatomy, in which she made such great progress that she excited the admiration of the illustrious Frotomedico Santorini, and also of the immortal Giambattista Morgagni, prince of the anatomists of our time. We have scattered these few flowers on the tomb of the late renowned Dogaressa, although her happy spirit is sufficiently requited by the tribute of tears and constant regret offered to her memory by her loving husband, H. Serene H. Alvise Mocenigo.\" After her death, her spouse remarried Polissena Contarini Da Mula in 1771, though she does not seem to have played to part of dogaressa in a ceremonial sense as much as did Pisana Conaro, though she did become the center of the literary circle her consort gathered on his private villa."

  "text" : "John Peter ‘Pitt’ Hornung was an entrepreneur who founded a number of sugar cane plantations in Portuguese East Africa (later Mozambique), known as the Sena Sugar Estates, in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries; he was also a breeder of race horses, establishing the West Grinstead Stud in the 1920s. Pitt Hornung was born in 1861 in Cleveland Hills, Middlesbrough, England; his parents were immigrants from Transylvania who set up a flourishing trade and shipping business in the area. After being educated at the Collegiate School in Edinburgh, Scotland, he was sent away by his parents to work on a ranch in Uruguay. Upon his return to England, Pitt was again sent overseas to work, this time in Lisbon, Portugal. In 1883, Pitt met and married Laura de Paiva Raposo, whose father leased a number of concessions, or prazos, along the Zambezi delta in Portuguese East Africa. After the death of both his father and father-in-law, Pitt turned his own attentions to the concessions and, in 1889, he decided to attempt to establish sugar cane plantations at the concessions in Mopeia. Despite a number of setbacks, the first sugar was cut at Mopeia in 1893, producing a modest 600 tons. Nonetheless, the venture was successful enough to enable Pitt to raise sufficient funds to establish a second plantation and factory at nearby Caia, in 1906; the resulting company was known as the Sena Sugar Factory. By buying out other, less successful sugar cane concessions which had sprung up in the region and transforming them into successful entities – including a concession at Marromeu - Pitt’s business went from strength to strength, and he established a sugar cane empire. The various concerns were grouped into one company – the Sena Sugar Estates – in 1920, and a further factory was established at Luabo in 1922. As a result of his activities in Portuguese East Africa, Pitt became a wealthy man. Seeking a gentile lifestyle back in England, Pitt moved his family from Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, near London, to West Grinstead Park, West Sussex, which he purchased in 1913 from Sir Merrick Burrell. Having acquired a passion for both the breeding and racing of horses, Pitt eventually established his own stud, registering the West Grinstead Stud in 1924. Pitt enjoyed some considerable success as a breeder, and the West Grinstead Stud produced 129 winners over 26 years; however, his purchase of Papyrus, the 1923 Derby winner, was deemed commercially unsuccessful, since he failed to sire sufficient winners. Pitt Hornung died in February 1940. West Grinstead Park was sold off and the stud went on to become part of the National Stud in 1949, although one of Pitt’s sons, Colonel Charles Hornung, went on to establish his own stud in Cowfold, West Sussex, in 1950 (this was eventually liquidated in 1984). The Sena Sugar Estates remained a family concern until 1986, when the estates were sacked by Mozambique’s Renamo rebels during the country’s civil war. In 2009, the Hornung family presented the surviving archives of Hornung & Co Ltd, which managed Sena Sugar Estates and the West Grinstead Stud, amongst other concerns, to West Sussex Record Office (reference Accession 15353, ‘Hornung Papers’); a collection of records relating to the West Grinstead Stud had previously been deposited at West Sussex Record Office (reference Add Mss 41,180-41,211)."

He represented Bermuda in four editions of the Olympic Games (1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004), and has earned the second highest placement in the nation's Olympic history with an astonishing fourth-place finish. Bromby also captured a bronze medal, along with Michael Marcel, at the 1997 Star World Championships in Marblehead, Massachusetts, United States with a net total of 33 points. Bromby made his official debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where he placed nineteenth in the Star class, along with his partner and crew member Paul Fisher, with a net score of 119 points. At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Bromby posted a remarkable grade of 81 to pull off a thirteenth-place effort on the entire series while teaming up with his new partner Lee White in the same program. Following his mediocre performances in two straight Games, Bromby and his crew member White narrowly missed the podium in the Star class at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The Bermudian duo accumulated a net score of 45.3 points at the end of the opening series, finishing six points off bronze medalists and Brazilians Torben Grael and Marcelo Ferreira. Twelve years after competing in his first Olympics, Bromby qualified for his fourth Bermudian team, as a 39-year-old, in the Star class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. After achieving a fourth-place finish from Sydney, Bromby was appointed as the Bermudian flag bearer by the National Olympic Committee in the opening ceremony. Teaming again with White in the opening series, the Bermudian duo delivered an effortless eighth-place effort, including a powerful lead on the ninth leg, in a fleet of seventeen boats with a net total of 82 points."

Victorian Bar: Mandie signed the Victorian Bar Roll on 27th March 1969 and practised full time as a barrister from 1969 until his appointment as a judge in 1994.

Mandie retired from the Supreme Court of Victoria on 31 August 2012. The Chief Justice delivered the following address on 29 August 2012: CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: \"Before the Court rises this morning, I would wish to note that this is in very many respects an auspicious but sad occasion. It is the last time that His Honour Justice Mandie will sit as a member of the Supreme Court of Victoria and in particular as a Judge of the Victorian Court of Appeal. I am delighted to acknowledge the presence this morning at the bar table of the Chairman of the Victorian Bar, Ms Melanie Sloss SC and also the President of the Law Institute of Victoria Mr Michael Holcroft. They are very gracious to have attended this morning to acknowledge the departure of His Honour from the Bench. Typically, His Honour has been unforthcoming in providing opportunities to all of us to acknowledge his contribution to this Court and to the law in this state. His Honour preferred not to have a farewell and so there has not been a public opportunity for the Bar and the Profession to acknowledge His Honour's achievements and all he has done for the State. It falls to me, therefore, to make some remarks if I may. His Honour was appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court on 10 May 1994. Subsequently, after an illustrious career on the Bench, His Honour's standing in the judiciary was recognised and he was appointed on 11 August 2009 as a Judge of Appeal of the Supreme Court. It has been my privilege to sit with His Honour on many occasions in leading matters. I will return to His Honour's career in the Trial Division in a moment. But it is appropriate to go back a little in time to acknowledge the distinction of His Honour both academically and his career as a younger lawyer. His Honour graduated with honours in Bachelor of Laws, indeed first class honours, in 1965 from the University of Melbourne. His Honour was the Supreme Court prize winner in his year and also the EJB Nunn Scholarship winner in the 1965 Law Honours examination. He played a very active role at all stages of his university life in university debating and moots as would be anticipated. After leaving university His Honour went to complete his articles of clerkship with Russell Kennedy and Cook, his principal was Mr R.W. Lloyd. His Honour was admitted to practice on 2 May 1966. Subsequently, His Honour never stood still, subsequently, he went to the United States and studied for his Master of Laws Degree at Yale University which he achieved in 1967. He returned to Australia and between 1967 to 1969 he worked as a solicitor with Russell, Kennedy, Cook. Again, His Honour never stood still. He played an active part in academic life and was engaged as a lecturer at the University of Melbourne lecturing in areas such as civil procedure. But the call of the Bar was strong and indeed most appropriately on 27 March 1969 His Honour signed the Roll of the Victorian Bar with his pupil master Mr Peter Brusey. His Honour engaged in full time practice, rising to be one of the leaders of the Victorian Commercial Bar during the period 1969 to 1994. He had two readers, John A. Gibson and also Jennifer Davies, now Justice Davies a Judge of the Supreme Court. His Honour took silk and became Queen's Counsel for Victoria in 1983. During his time at the Bar, His Honour was indeed a very active member and contributor to the Bar. He belonged to all number of councils and committees. The Young Barristers’ Committee, the Bar Ethics Committee, the Joint Bar and Law Institute Committee on Commonwealth Constitution Reform, the Leo Cussen Property Law Advisory Committee and the Attorney-General's Working Party on the Legal Profession Act and so it goes. There were indeed extensive involvements by His Honour in a wide range of areas. His Honour has always played, too, a very strong role in relation to the Jewish community. He was President of the National Union of Australasian Jewish Students in 1965, he was a member of the Board of Management at Temple Beth Israel, Liberal Congregation, Kew 1971-2 and at St Kilda in 1973. At the Victorian Supreme Court His Honour played a very significant part in the commercial litigation work of the Court. I had the privilege of serving with His Honour on the Commercial List, the precursor of the now Commercial Court for a period of two years. In those days it was indeed a very busy time. His Honour and I ran both the Corporations List and the Commercial List, it being a time when the Federal Jurisdiction did not have jurisdiction with respect to corporations. We were both very busy judges and I believe that His Honour played an important role in turning around the recognition and standing of this Court with respect to both corporation and commercial litigation. As the Commercial List judge His Honour took on very difficult and burdensome cases. Perhaps the high watermark in one sense was His Honour's conduct of the trial and eventual judgment in the long case brought by the Australian Security and Investments Commission against Waterwheel Holdings. It was a very significant case with respect to directors' duties and responsibilities. Subsequently the matter was considered on appeal and the substantive judgment of His Honour was found to be impeccable. It was indicative of the work of His Honour in the corporations and commercial area. However, later in his career, as I have already indicated, His Honour was called to the appellate bench. There His Honour has sat in all jurisdictions, and if I might say, His Honour seems to have relished sitting in criminal matters. It has been a delight and a privilege to sit with him, and the President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Maxwell, would want me to acknowledge His Honour's contribution to the Court in the last few years. His Honour is married to Marilyn Mandie, well known to many, she is a lawyer, and they have two daughters, Deborah and Sarah. It has been a delight to have his Honour’s family involved in the court. One of the high moments of His Honour's personal life has been the occasion when his wife Marilyn moved the admission of their daughter Deborah to be a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Deborah has gone on to a flourishing career at the Victorian Bar. It is indeed, as I said at the outset, a sad occasion. It has been a wonderful career that His Honour has had, both in the profession and at the Bar and then later on the Bench. We all congratulate His Honour for his achievement and we thank him for his contribution to the law and, in particular, to the administration of justice in this State.\" In July 2013 Mandie was appointed a Reserve Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria for a term of five years."

He studied architecture, figure, ornate and modeling in clay at the Academy of St. Luke in Rome, and his teacher in modeling was Pietro Tenerani. He initially apprenticed with Bartolomeo Rinaldi: but soon set up his own studio. He was prolific. He engraved portraits or scenes, in profile and perspective, large and small, on medallions, pins, rings, bracelets bearing engraved stones from him. His onyx (soft) cameos were engraved steel tip, while his cameos on shells and semi-precious hard stones (pietre dure), were engraved with a diamond-dust lathe. For a noble Polish noblewoman, he engraved a series of medallions representing the Kings of Poland. This collection in shell cameos, was begun in 1860, and completed in 1870. He completed a medallion depicting the Lacoon of the Vatican Palace. he has also made copies of sculpture of Thorvaldsen, Gibson, Canova, and Fedi. He engraved Fedi's Rape of Polyxena, displayed under the Loggia dei Lanzi, in a cameo, which was stolen at the Centennial Exposition of Philadelphia. He made a tryptich of sardonyx cameos to celebrate the family of the Queen Margherita of Savoy: the first depicts the monument raised in Turin for the Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Genoa (Queen's father), the other an equestrian statue of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, father of the then present king; and the third medal was the portrait of the then Prince of Naples, later King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. Siotto was awarded at the Expositions of Rome, Naples, Vienna, Philadelphia, and Melbourne. At Melbourne he exhibited in a glass exhibition case, the process of cameo engraving from the natural shell to completed carving."

With his guidance, his community developed a successful model of ecosystem management generating community funds and building community resilience. Before being recognised internationally as a hero, he spent 11 years working with his community to protect their ancestral lands from development associated with deforestation and advocating for indigenous peoples human rights. The United Nations said Preecha: \"...is a community leader with a vision for forest management. He is a source of inspiration for his community in revitalizing sustainable forest management systems. He has dedicated his life to demonstrating his belief that protecting nature is protecting a way of life\".

From 1784, he became a full-time composer. He worked at the Opéra as choirmaster from 1800 to 1802 and again from 1804 to 1805, before retiring to live in Chantilly. Candeille wrote four symphonies, as well as ballets, divertissements and sacred music (including a mass and a Magnificat). None of his operas achieved much success, with the exception of his revision of Jean-Philippe Rameau's Castor et Pollux. Candeille's version was premiered at the Paris Opéra on 14 June 1791. By 1 January 1793, it had had 50 performances. It continued to be one of the most popular operatic works in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period and was last staged in 1817. Candeille retained much of Rameau's original music, including \"almost all the dances.\" Candeille was the father of the composer, singer and actor Amélie-Julie Candeille."

He was the son of a poor boatman. At a young age, his talent for woodcarving was recognised. Wealthy patrons enabled him to study at the Kunstnijverheidsschool Quellinus in Amsterdam (an art school) and later at the Académie des Beaux Arts in Paris. In 1885 Pander won the Dutch Prix de Rome for sculpture, but a serious illness disabled him. He moved to Rome in 1893, where he set up a studio. He frequently travelled to the Netherlands where he became famous for his design of the portrait of Queen Wilhelmina for a Dutch coin in 1898. Pander was friends with the Dutch writer Louis Couperus, who lived in Nice and Rome between 1900 and 1915. He eventually died in Rome from the effects of tuberculosis. \n*       \n*       \n*       \n*       \n*"

Prabhuraj has worked closely with Ram Gopal Verma as an Executive Producer and synergized his film making style and vision. He has learned the technical aspects of filmmaking in all genres, he knows well how to express his creativity in a way that touches a person's emotional core, excites the viewer and makes the audience laugh. He has also studied the craft of acting for the last 10 years. This pursuit has made him a better actor, but more importantly, his studies have enabled him to better communicate as a director with his actors to get their best performances. For Prabhuraj the moment has come to prove his definition of good cinema and the proverbial director being not only one who has technical knowledge, but one who has a lot of life experience, which he will carry into film narrative style and picturisation."

She was a daughter of King George X of Kartli and Tamar-Mariam Lipartiani-Dadiani. Princess Elene was affianced to Tsar Feodor II of Russia. In \"Istoria Gosudarstva Rossiyskogo\" by Nikolay Karamzin she is described by Russian prince Mikhail Tatishev as: King George X of Kartli gave the oath, but the princess stayed in Georgia until the next Russian visit, by which time Feodor II was no longer alive. The later fate of the princess is unknown."

  "text" : "Peter Campbell Craigie (August 18, 1938 – September 26, 1985) was a British biblical scholar. Craigie was born in Lancaster and grew up in Edinburgh. He studied successively at the Edinburgh Academy, the Prairie Bible Institute in Alberta, New College at the University of Edinburgh, St. John's College at the University of Durham, the University of Aberdeen, and McMaster University. He then taught at Carleton University, McMaster University, and the University of Calgary. He died as the result of a car crash in 1985. Craigie wrote commentaries on Deuteronomy, Ezekiel, the Twelve Prophets, and Psalms 1 – 50. He referred to his approach as \"theological-historical\" or \"theological-scientific\". Lyle Eslinger notes that Cragie's approach was \"a melding of conservative theological interests and assumptions with the scientific methods of biblical criticism.\" Tremper Longman describes him as being \"among the best of recent evangelical interpreters\" as well as \"an astute theologian and philologist\". In 1988, a Festschrift was published in his honour. Ascribe to the Lord: Biblical and Other Studies in Memory of Peter C. Craigie included contributions from R. K. Harrison, Kenneth Kitchen, Alan Millard, and Robert Polzin. The Canadian Society of Biblical Studies sponsors the biannual Craigie Lecture in his memory."

  "text" : "Pierre Chevalier (born in Orbec, France on 23 March 1915) is a French film director and screenwriter. His films included mainstream, erotic and pornographic films. Horror film buffs know him for his 1971 opus Orloff and the Invisible Man (aka The Invisible Dead). He also assisted well-known directors in films, notably with Henri Verneuil, René Clément, Jesus Franco and others. Chevalier served as art director on Jesus Franco's Man Hunter (1980), and filmed some additional footage that was added to the adult film Cecilia (the retitled 1983 re-release version of Jesus Franco's Sexual Aberrations of a Married Woman). Jesus Franco co-directed Convoy of Women with Chevalier (uncredited) in 1974. The film was re-released in 1978 as East of Berlin."

Bishop Peter Mason sat on the board of Grenville Christian College and investigated the allegations of abuse in 2001. He admitted in an email in 2001 that he was “most anxious about the situation” and that he was “trying to grasp the enormity of the troubles that had ensued over the years.” He recommended that the staff get counseling. He also traveled across the border to the Community of Jesus in Massachusetts, which had close relations with the Anglican Diocese of Ontario, to investigate. In 2007,Bishop Mason told the Globe and Mail, a national newspaper in Canada, that he did not think the complaints brought to him by Grenville staff about The Rev. Charles Farnsworth, Grenville headmaster, were “substantive enough for him to take disciplinary action”. He said that he had heard allegations from former staff members of cult behavior at Grenville, but had not been aware that it involved students."

  "text" : "Paul-Louis Landsberg (3 December 1901 – 2 April 1944) was a twentieth century Existentialist philosopher who is known for his arguments in support of euthanasia as an acceptable method of suicide. His arguments are used today by Christian proponents of euthanasia. His best known works are The Experience of Death and The Moral Problem of Suicide. Landsberg lectured at the Universities of Bonn, Madrid and Paris, among others. He was a pupil of Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl and Max Scheler, continuing their work in Phenomenology to tackle several vital subjects, including personal identity, death and suicide. He was a close friend of the Christian Existentialist Emmanuel Mounier and a key contributor to the philosophical journal Esprit (1913-2013). Landsberg was hounded by the Gestapo for most of his life, both because of his Jewish family background and due to his expression of Anti-Nazi sentiments. He was captured by the Gestapo and deported to Oranienburg Concentration Camp towards the end of the war and died there of physical and mental exhaustion in April 1944."

A graduate of Brasenose College, Oxford, he was appointed the Dean of Waterford on 9 March 1547. Four years later, Walsh was nominated the Bishop of Waterford and Lismore by Edward VI of England on 9 June 1551 and was consecrated by royal mandate on 23 October 1551. He retained the deanery of Waterford until he resigned it on 15 June 1566. After the accession of Queen Mary I, Walsh was recognized bishop by the Holy See in 1555/1556. But following the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, Walsh supported the crown's reformation legislation in the 1560 Irish Parliament. In a letter of 12 October 1561, the papal legate Fr David Wolfe SJ described all the bishops in Munster as 'adherents of the Queen'. Bishop Walsh was appointed to an ecclesiastical commission for enforcing the royal supremacy in June 1564. Described as a 'crypto-catholic' in 1577, Walsh had custody of the papal Bishop of Cork and Cloyne, Edmund Tanner, who described him as 'the heretical bishop of Waterford'; and persuaded him to make a 'strictly private' rejection of the Protestant faith. Bishop Walsh died in 1578, and was described as a 'confirmed heretic' by the Franciscan Thomas Strange."
