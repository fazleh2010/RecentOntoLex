  "text" : "Rita Miljo (1931 Klaipėda, Lithuania - 27 July 2012 Phalaborwa district), was a renowned conservationist and animal rights pioneer noted for founding and managing the \"Centre for Animal Rehabilitation and Education\" (CARE) near Phalaborwa in South Africa. She died in a fire which swept through her home and the centre located on a 50-acre reserve on the banks of the Olifants River. She was 81 at the time of her death. The first baboon she ever saved, in 1980, also died in the blaze, with two other baboons. Born Rita Neumann, she joined the League of German Girls (the girls' wing of the Hitler Youth) at age 8. She enjoyed the sports competition, and being able to escape an “overprotective mother”. As for Nazism, she said that “only today, in hindsight, do I understand the total madness we were subjected to”. Her plans to qualify as a veterinarian were thwarted by the postwar West German policy of favouring war veterans for admission to universities. After working in a Hamburg zoo, she followed a mining engineer, Lothar Simon to South Africa in 1953 and became his wife. While married to Simon she became a proficient pilot and he later died, with her 17-year-old daughter, in a 1972 light aircraft crash. Ten years later, she bought the small Lowveld farm that would become her baboon centre. A short-lived second marriage which ended in divorce, was to Piet Miljo, a South African. At first the centre rescued a variety of small animals, such as bushbabies, civets, warthogs, duikers, porcupines, assorted reptiles and birds. Soon large numbers of orphaned, injured and abused chacma baboons were being brought to the centre. Despite being listed in the CITES Appendix II, they enjoy almost no protection under South African law. Shrinking and degrading their habitat has brought them into conflict with farmers. Prior to Miljo's sanctuary, no facilities existed in South Africa for rehabilitating these orphans. Consequently, in 1989 she started the centre to nurse orphaned and injured baboons back to health, at the same time pioneering methods of reintroducing troops of convalesced baboons back into their natural habitat. The first such group of 10 baboons was released back into the wild in 1994, confounding many skeptical professional primatologists. In all more than a dozen troops, totalling some 250 baboons, were released in the last 20 years of her life. Her standard response to police and prosecutors who harassed her and regarded baboons as vermin, was \"Who are you to tell God that he should not have created baboons?\" Sponsorship from IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare), and other financial backing, resulted in a steady stream of volunteer workers, scientists and students, and the rehabilitation facility became known around the world. Nelson Mandela's presence at one of the successful releases of rehabilitated troops in 2002, eased her persecution by authorities. Her ideals followed those of Jane Goodall’s with chimpanzees in Tanzania, Dian Fossey’s with gorillas in Rwanda and Biruté Galdikas’s with orangutans in Indonesian Borneo. However, Rita Miljo had not started her work with formal scientific training, and she was motivated to help animals for humanitarian reasons. In 1980 she removed a battered young baboon from a national park in Angola. She rescued many baboon orphans, finding one clinging to the dead body of its mother in a garbage dump. A number of rescued baboons were being held captive for their faeces which could be used in tribal medicines. Others were the subject of medical experiments."

Perrier is further credited in history for having introduced synthetic fabrics to French haute couture, a major novelty at the time. In addition, his family’s private artistic salon, dubbed R-26, was a bohemian gathering place for many creative luminaries of the 1930s to 1960s, including singer Josephine Baker, architect Le Corbusier and musician Django Reinhardt. He was the husband of lyricist Madeleine (Brault) Perrier and the father of journalist Marie-Jacques Perrier."

Her thesis is on the anthropology of the body.Her artistic work is on the concept of the body in terms of public processions, installed in urban spacesand followed by the gaze of passers-by.Gesture is at the center of these paintings that come to life through her body. Her aim is to show howa state of trance, alienation and madness, can manifest on the body, especially in the precarioushuman conditions that exist on the margins of society (related to employment, wide social networks,and family). Women, Saints, Daughters, Icons of everyday life, the protagonists of Romina DeNovellis's work originate from her studies in anthropology and ethnomusicology. These womenbecome a social message and, at the same time, politics."

She is considered one of America's yoga pioneers and was one of the first yoga teachers in the USA. Her mother, a student of Yogananda took her to her first yoga class at age 15. As an adult, Vernon was one of the early students of BKS Iyengar in North America and hosted him on his first visit to California in 1973. Vernon founded the American Yoga College, where she still teaches today. She also founded the organization Unity in Yoga International, which eventually evolved into the Yoga Alliance and which sponsored seven national and three international conferences under Vernon's direction, including the Soviet-American Yoga Conference in Moscow in October 1990. The founders of The International Association of Yoga Therapists, Richard Miller and Larry Payne, acknowledged Vernon's contribution to the creation of the association though the connections she fostered at the Unity in Yoga conferences. Vernon established the Center for Soviet-American Dialogue in 1984 to help connect the citizens of the United States with those of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.  She served as a citizen diplomat, bringing groups of ordinary people to dialogue across borders, and even appeared on a Soviet morning show. She later simplified the name of her organization to the Center for International Dialogue and expanded its reach into the Middle East, visiting Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza with American citizens."

  "text" : "Rudolf Christian Friedrich Lechler (Chinese: 黎力基) (26 July 1824 – 29 March 1908), was a German Protestant Christian missionary to China, and is one of early leaders of the Basel Mission evangelizing to the Hakka people. Lechler spent 52 years in China. The Basel Hakka Mission that he administered was responsible for establishing over 51 mission stations, 56 schools with over two thousand members.Lechler is known today for administering to the early Hakka Christian church and, together with his mission coworkers, facilitated in the resettling of Hakka Christian communities fleeing from persecution to Southeast Asian countries of which new congregations such as the Basel Christian Church of Malaysia and the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore were subsequently formed. Lechler appreciated China's cultural heritage and was able to preach in several varieties of Chinese, including Mandarin, Hokkien, and Hakka, the last of which he knew well enough to help prepare a Romanized Hakka edition of the Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke. Today the Hakka Christian community is estimated to have 150,000 members worldwide."

Thoeren had already ceased acting and begun writing screenplays for films and became a top writer in the United States working with leading directors including Joseph Losey and William Dieterle. Thoeren returned to Germany after the Second World War and continued his career as a screenwriter. His story idea for the 1935 French film Fanfares of Love and its 1951 German remake Fanfares of Love was used as the basis for Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot released in 1959, two years after his death.

After several years at the Socony Vacuum Oil Company he joined General Electric in 1943. \"Mr. Krieble remained with General Electric, rising from research chemist to general manager of the chemical development department, until he left in 1956 to work full time at Loctite.\" The Heritage Foundation runs a \"Robert H. Krieble Lecture\" series in his honor, and since 1998 provides a \"Robert H. Krieble Fellow in Coalition Relations\" based on an endowment by Krieble's family.

In 2014 he was one of a number of British critics accused of sexism in respect of their reviews of the mezzo-soprano Tara Erraught, who was singing the title role in a new production of Der Rosenkavalier. Morrison, who described Erraught's portrayal of Octavian as \"unsightly and unappealing,” apologized by saying, “Several musicians I count as close friends tell me that what I wrote would have upset greatly the promising young singer who took the role of Octavian. I regret that.”"

  "text" : "Robert Hurwitz has been president of Nonesuch Records since 1984. He previously ran the American operations of ECM Records, after beginning his career at Columbia Records. Hurwitz grew up in Los Angeles, where he was trained as a pianist, then went on to study at the University of California, Berkeley. Founded as a classical label in 1964, Nonesuch expanded into the world music field in 1967 with its Explorer series. Since Hurwitz became head of the company, it has further expanded its mission to include artists from a wide range of musical genres, including jazz, musical theater, folk, bluegrass, and rock. Among the artists he has signed or worked with are composers including John Adams, Timo Andres, Louis Andriessen, Henryk Górecki, Philip Glass, Ástor Piazzolla, Steve Reich, Stephen Sondheim, and John Zorn as well as performers and songwriters including Björk, Jeremy Denk, Bill Frisell, Richard Goode, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, Kronos Quartet, Gidon Kremer, k.d. lang, Audra McDonald, Brad Mehldau, Pat Metheny, Punch Brothers, Randy Newman, Joshua Redman, Fernando Otero, Chris Thile, Dawn Upshaw, and Caetano Veloso. During this time, the label’s artist roster has grown to also include Laurie Anderson, The Black Keys, Buena Vista Social Club, Carolina Chocolate Drops, Ry Cooder, Emmylou Harris, and Wilco, among many others. Hurwitz has produced recordings by Caetano Veloso, Stephen Sondheim, Astor Piazzolla, and Teresa Stratas, and was the producer of the 1993 film George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker. Nonesuch releases have won 42 Grammy Awards during his tenure. Robert Hurwitz has taught a course at The New School in New York City since 2006. In a July 1998 article on Hurwitz and Nonesuch Records, the Boston Globe’s Ed Siegel wrote: “Under Robert Hurwitz, Nonesuch Records has been an oasis of artistic excitement. When one picks up a Nonesuch CD, there is a sense of occasion, the feeling that the artists in question have been assembled not as an exercise in star power, but as an exercise in artistic exploration.” An October 2004 New York Times Magazine profile written by Russell Shorto states: “In a business now largely run by accountants and M.B.A.’s, Hurwitz is, in the words of Stephen Sondheim, ‘one of the few left who practice the making of records as a craft.’”"

  "text" : "Capt. Richard Stephens (1585 - 1636) in Wiltshire, England arrived as an unmarried man of means with two to four servants, at Jamestown Settlement in 1623 aboard The George. Stevens was an experience military man and quickly began to establish himself in the colony by acquiring land, and was soon named Burgess in the colony. After building a blockhouse and receiving patent on the same, the Captain was issued the first English land grant in the colony as incentive for other landowners to follow his example and build gardens within their property holdings. Captain Stephens amassed nearly 2000 acres by his death in 1636. Stephens married Elizabeth Piercy, b. 1600, daughter of Abraham Piercy - Cape Merchant of Jamestown. They had four sons; John, William, Richard L. and Samuel Stephens. Stephens fought the first duel in the English colonies after an argument with George Harrison, the latter being struck just below the knee. Harrison died two weeks later, though not from the wound, but some other malady of the time. Such an encounter in North America was not to be repeated for some 100 years. As Burgess, Stephens (and local citizenry as well) often found themselves at odds with the then Governor of Jamestown: Governor Harvey. The governor was prone to angry outbursts, and was documented to have attacked Stephens with a cane or cudgel, knocking out a number of his teeth. The governor, was eventually deposed and sent back to England, where he faced charges for numerous mistreatments of members of the colony. Upon the Captain's death, Elizabeth Piercy Stephens is said to have married Governor Harvey. Two of Stevens sons, Samuel and Richard L.s made names for themselves in the new world as well. Samuel Stephens rose to prominence and become the 2nd Governor of the North Carolina settlement in the region known as the Albermarle, and Richard L. (Lawrence) Stephens for a time dropped his last name, (a protective measure) as commander of the garrison at Bacon's Castle in the mid 1670s - during Bacon's Rebellion."

Perhaps his best-known property in Philadelphia was the Forum Theatre, an adult theatre. In early June, 2013, a building controlled by Basciano at 2136 Market Street in Philadelphia collapsed during demolition, killing six and injuring 13. By the mid-1990s, the adult entertainment industry was undergoing rapid change. Efforts by the city to sanitize Times Square compounded the widespread adoption of VCRs. Operating through STB Investment Group and other firms, Basciano sold his properties as neighborhoods became gentrified."

  "text" : "Ralph R. Perlman (May 16, 1917 – May 24, 2013) was the state budget director in his adopted U.S. state of Louisiana, having served under four governors of both parties from 1967 until 1988. Thereafter, Perlman continued to hold other public service positions. Perlman was born in New York City, the only son of a Jewish couple of European descent, Harry and Bessie Perlman. He received his undergraduate degree from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and a master's in business from Columbia University in New York City. During World War II, Perlman served with distinction in the European Theater as an artillery officer with the United States Army 63rd Infantry Division. While stationed at Camp Van Dorn in Mississippi, he met and subsequently married the former Carol Herzberg, who was also Jewish. The Perlmans established residence in Baton Rouge, where he was first engaged in business. Carol Perlman died of cancer in 1981; in 1984, Perlman remarried. In 1964, Governor John McKeithen appointed Perlman as the executive assistant to the commissioner of administration, W. W. McDougall. In 1966, he briefly joined the staff of then-State Representative J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., a Shreveport lawyer, who subsequently became a state senator in 1968 and a U.S. senator in 1972. In 1967, Governor McKeithen named Perlman as state budget director. In that capacity he developed the Office of State Group Benefits, which handles the medical claims of state employees and retirees. He also oversaw the state's $5 million investment in the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition held in New Orleans. In 1988, Perlman became the special assistant for finance under Governors Buddy Roemer, Edwin Edwards, and Murphy J. Foster, Jr. In 1997, Foster appointed Perlman secretary of the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, a position that he held for five years. In 2002, then University of Louisiana System President Sally Clausen hired him as a special assistant. According to Clausen, whom Perlman considered his \"goddaughter\", Perlman \"treated every budget as though it was coming out of his own pocket. ... If I was running the state, I’d want Ralph Perlman watching my dollars. ... In the first year [as executive assistant], he saved me a million dollars from minor stuff. He was a magician in common sense.\" Son Gerald Lee \"Jerry\" Perlman (born c. 1947) of Shreveport, Louisiana, described his father as \"very detail-oriented, and he always had all the facts at his fingertips. He had a very retentive memory.” Perlman died in a Baton Rouge hospice at the age of ninety-six after a brief illness. In addition to his son, he was survived by his second wife of twenty-nine years, Billie Williams Perlman (born c. 1927), his daughter-in-law, Francine Perlman, two grandchildren, and a stepdaughter. In 2011, Perlman was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield."

She won the following year in a championship record time of 4:47.9, retained the national mile title in 1967 and won the newly introduced 1500 metres in 1968, 1970 and 1971. She won the national cross country championships in 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1974. In 1974 she also won a bronze medal in the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. In 1969 she achieved a British record time of 4:15.9 in the 1500 m and she set a new record of 4:15.4 in 1970 and then 4:14.3 and 4:12.65 in 1971. In December 1968 she was the first British woman to break 10 minutes in the 3000 metres with a time of 9:59.6. She won the gold medal in the 1500 m  at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. In a fiercely contested race, New Zealand's Sylvia Potts tripped and fell just one metre from the finish line, with Ridley carefully avoiding the falling athlete on her outside, to take the title."

  "text" : "Richard Methley, also known as Richard Firth or Richard Furth (c.1451–1527/8), was a monk of the Carthusian house of Mount Grace Priory in Yorkshire in the second half of the fifteenth century. He is remembered for his writings - some original, and some translations. Little is known about his life. He seems to have been born near Leeds (surnames were generally taken from the village of birth, so it is likely he was born in the village of Methley, seven miles south-west of Leeds on the road to Pontefract in Yorkshire), but proof is lacking and his dialect casts doubt on this identification. He entered Mount Grace aged about 25, seemingly spending the rest of his life at that same house, since his writings give no indication that he was ever resident in another house of the Order. He wrote primarily for his fellow Carthusians, and so his writings are in Latin except for a short Middle English Letter. Methley's own surviving writings date mainly from the 1480s. They have all been printed in modern editions. Methley produced a Latin glossed translation of The Cloud of Unknowing in 1491 for his fellow Carthusian Thurstan Watson. He also then began a Latin glossed translation of the Middle English version of The Mirror of Simple Souls, though he was unaware that the work had been written by the executed heretic Marguerite Porete. Edmund Colledge and James Walsh prepared an edition of these texts in the 1960s, but it was never published. He died, almost certainly at Mount Grace, at some point in the year before 3 May 1528, when his name was entered among the deaths recorded at the Carthusian general chapter."

Neppach was comparatively unusual among set designers during the era in having university training. In 1932 he switched to concentrate on film production. In May 1933, his first Jewish wife Nelly, a successful tennis player, took her life because of the discrimination and prosecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. He married Grete Walter, daughter of the composer Bruno Walter, in autumn of 1933. With his Jewish wife, life grew increasingly difficult for him under the Nazis. He began to work as an architect again and the couple emigrated to Switzerland. In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, he shot himself and his wife."

  "text" : "Ry Rocklen is a contemporary artist based in Los Angeles, working primarily in sculpture. Rocklen's work has been shown nationally and internationally, and has been included in several major survey exhibitions, including \"Made in LA\" at the Hammer Museum and the 2008 Whitney Biennial. Rocklen was born in 1978 and attended UCLA. He is represented by Thomas Solomon Gallery in Los Angeles, Untitled in New York and Praz-Delavallade in Paris. Rocklen's solo exhibitions, which have frequently been reviewed in art publications, often make use of found objects which have been adorned or otherwise modified. Said Sarah Lehrer-Graiwer of his 2009 exhibition at Parker Jones, \"But as much as Rocklen’s elaborate sculptural alterations to found objects revitalize the weary and return refuse from the brink of oblivion, they also scrutinize the contingencies of matter’s decomposition and express a sense of wonder at the accidental textures and forms to be discovered in states of decay.\" Katie Anania wrote, \"Rocklen seems to be conceding that his perception of objects is idiosyncratic and partial, so he works to dismantle our experience of them as well.\" Brian Sholis noted in Artforum, \"Rocklen's role as an object healer stems from his interest in diverse notions of health and spirituality, two interrelated themes that underpin other works in the show.\" From the Made in LA catalogue: \"Ry Rocklen (b. 1978 Los Angeles) works with vintage objects that are chimerically transformed by the artist into farcical performative objects. In his hands, abandoned debris or kitsch is quixotically plasticized into a brand of postminimalist sculpture with a seductive touch of bling. Mundane objects are amplified and aestheticized when chromed or covered with mosaic tiles, producing a sculptural language that is theatrical, absurd, and graceful—a kind of wry ornamental formalism. A modular tiled floor made from paintings bought at thrift stores and flea markets becomes a stage for sculptures, including a tree composed of copper pipes, concrete, and VHS tape and a golden hay bale. In the production of a concretized uncanny, Rocklen attempts to achieve a fantasy of material alchemy that strips objects of their purpose and familiarity while revitalizing their use, circulation, and value.\" Trinie Dalton, writing in the 2008 Biennial Catalogue, remarked, \"Ry Rocklen’s sculptures paradoxically reflect at once a respect for the Duchampian sculptural tradition and an anarchic rebellion against art historical constraints. Collecting cast-off objects from the streets, dumps, or thrift stores, he doctors and assembles them into readymade sculptures charged with an eccentric delicacy that gives them a second, more “poetic” life. Rocklen strategically capitalizes on the viewer’s mental and emotional associations, as Robert Rauschenberg did for his Combines, by selecting objects as much for their cultural connotations as their form. At times employing a wry sense of humor to balance his stringent editing techniques, Rocklen treats manufactured items, like toys, food packaging, furniture remnants, and construction materials, with a spontaneity he traces back to his youth and the development of the creative process through pretend play. This sense of play is reenacted in Rocklen’s process-based studio practice, as he sifts through and rearranges society’s leftovers.\""

He graduated from the University of Cincinnati School of Architecture and Harvard University's Graduate School of Design before establishing residency in New Jersey. He was one of the original founders of Beyer Blinder Belle Architects & Planners LLP (BBB)\"Beyer Blinder Belle\", an international architecture firm based in New York City and Washington, DC.  The firm's name is derived from the three founding partners: John H. Beyer, Richard Blinder, and John Belle. The three architects met in 1961 while working in the New York office of Victor Gruen. The trio developed a specialty in historic preservation. At the time of his death in September 2006, Richard Blinder was working on the Shanghai Cultural Plaza, a theater project in the Luwan District. The project was commissioned to Beyer Blinder Belle through an international design competition in 2003 for the redevelopment of a full-block site in central Shanghai's largest historic preservation area, the former French Concession. This development was one of the signature projects undertaken by the Chinese government for the 2010 World Expo. Beyer Blinder Belle has won three Presidential Design Awards, the Medal of Honor from the American Institute of Architects New York Chapter, and the national AIA Firm Award, as well as other awards."

  "text" : "Roberto Olivo (January 13, 1914 – June 22, 2005) was an international baseball umpire. He was born in Caracas, Venezuela. Olivo is regarded as one of the best umpires in Venezuelan baseball history. In a career that spanned 29 years, his fame spread among his colleagues in the Caribbean, Mexico and the United States, both for his proper personality and extensive knowledge of the game and its rules, earning the respect of players, managers, fans and baseball writers. A member of two Halls of Fame, he also umpired in two Baseball World Cups and several Caribbean Series. Olivo was inclined towards outdoor activities and sports since he was 16. At school level he participated in basketball, track and field, swimming and volleyball. After graduating, he briefly attempted to play semipro baseball, but turned to umpiring when he was asked to fill in for an umpire that did not show up to a game. In those days, only two umpires covered typical regular games, and a player with a reputation for honesty might be pressed into service if one umpire became incapacitated. Olivo was asked to fill in one game and took to it well, being encouraged by a teammate to attend a professional umpire training school. He successfully made it through the school and worked his way to the Venezuelan Baseball First Division for the 1940 campaign. He then became a founding member of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League, when the circuit joined organized baseball in 1946. Olivo was knicknamed Tarzan for his impressive physique (He was about 6' 2\", 220 pounds). It was an alias that he adopted and proudly used while umpiring in the Venezuelan league until 1968. In the interim, he also worked in the 1944 and 1945 Baseball World Cup tournaments and 11 Caribbean Series. Usually, he ran umpiring clinics and guided young umpires. In addition, Olivo was the home plate umpire in four VPBL memorable games: On January 20, 1946, when Alejandro Carrasquel of the Navegantes del Magallanes won a 17-inning, complete game pitching duel against Roy Welmaker and the Sabios de Vargas by a score of 3–2. On December 15, 1955, when Lenny Yochim of the Leones del Caracas hurled the first no-hitter game in the league's history, defeating Ramón Monzant and the Navegantes del Magallanes, 3–0. Furthermore, he also called balls and strikes in decisive games that gave the championship title both Magallanes (1949–1950) as the Leones (1952–1953). In 1988 Olivo gained induction into the Venezuela Sports Hall of Fame. In 2003, he was enshrined in the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum as part of their first class. Olivo died at the age of 91 in Caracas, due to natural causes, and was buried at the Cementerio del Este in Caracas."

Fisher, (February 18, 1879 Plymouth, Devon, England – July 20, 1969 Carlotta, California, United States) served in the California legislature and during the Spanish–American War he served in the United States Army. Fisher was born in Plymouth, Devon on February 18, 1879 and emigrated to America in 1885 with his parents, Charles Ponsford Fisher (1850–1922) and Harriet Oyns Fisher (1849–1922). The family settled in the mountains outside of San Diego, California. In 1898 Fisher enlisted in the Army during the Spanish–American War and served 13 months in the Philippines with the Third Artillery. After the war, he returned to the Philippines and ran a ligterage company for 12 years. He met his future wife, Bess Hayne Dawson (1883–1974) in Manila; they came back to the United States to be married in August 1912. The young couple took over management of his family's newly purchased ranch near Carlotta in Humboldt County, California. Fisher was the first president of the Humboldt County Farm Bureau and an early member of the Fortuna Rotary Club. Mrs. Fisher was also active in the community and in the Humboldt County and California State Federation of Women's Clubs. Fisher ran for state Assembly in Humboldt County the first time in 1926, won the seat and retained it for the next two elections in 1928 and 1930, serving until 1932. He was a member of the Republican party. In 1962, the couple celebrated fifty years of marriage and lived in Carlotta for the rest of their lives. In 1969, the California Assembly named Bridge 04-089 which had been built the previous year over Yager Creek in Carlotta, after Fisher. When he died, he was the last Spanish–American War veteran in Humboldt County. The Fishers are buried in Ocean View Cemetery Alcove C, Niche 1."

American comedian and actor Bob Hope credits O'Donnell as the person who gave him his \"big break into show business\" in Hope’s autobiography Have Tux, Will Travel. O'Donnell was also instrumental in beginning the acting career of Audie Murphy. While working as a theater usher at the age of twelve in his hometown of Chicago, O’Donnell survived the infamous Iroquois Theatre fire, the deadliest theater fire and the deadliest single-building fire in United States history; it killed 605 people."

  "text" : "Rufus Hathaway (1770–1822) was an American physician and folk art painter. He lived in southern Massachusetts, where he painted numerous portraits between 1790 and 1795. He later studied medicine and established himself as a doctor at Duxbury. Hathway was born in Freetown, Massachusetts, and was the eldest of six children born to Asa Hathaway and Mary Phillips; his father and grandfather were ship carpenters. The family moved several times, settling in Bristol, Rhode Island in the mid-1780s. The source of Hathaway's artistic training is unknown, though it is believed he may have worked as a decorative artist or apprentice ship-carver; as a painter he appears to have been self-taught. He is known to have been active in the vicinity of Taunton, Massachusetts in 1790. Hathaway arrived in Duxbury in 1791, and began painting portraits of members of locally prominent families. In 1795 he married Judith Winsor, the daughter of a locally important merchant. He took up medicine at this time, possibly at the behest of his new wife's family, studying with Dr. Isaac Winslow of Marshfield. He seems to have abandoned painting, as very few works by his hand are known after the time of his marriage, although paintings dating to as late as 1808 are known. Hathaway had twelve children by Judith; at one time the only physician in Duxbury, he was highly respected in the field, and was elected Honorary Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society shortly before his death. One of his granddaughters was the abolitionist and suffragist Judith Winsor Smith, and surgeon Frederick Winsor was a great-nephew. Thirty-three portraits by Hathaway are known to exist, dating almost exclusively to the years between 1790 and 1795; all are of relatives and friends. He also painted landscapes, portrait miniatures, and overmantels. One genre painting, the Welch Curate of about 1800, is known; it was adapted from an English mezzotint. Furthermore, he is known to have created at least one wood carving, a figure of an eagle used to crown a temporary arch constructed to inaugurate a new bridge over the Bluefish River, and he carved the frames to some of his paintings. Hathaway was remembered as a physician on his epitaph, which he may have composed himself. A bill of sale for six portraits of the Weston family exists, dating to 1793; it indicates that the paintings cost six pounds, and that Hathaway charged a further three shillings for the frame on the portrait of Ezra Weston. In 2006, a pair of portraits, of Josiah Dean III and his wife, Sarah, were sold at Sotheby's, fetching $380,000 for the pair."

His father was a lay preacher in the congregation that later built the British Methodist Episcopal Church, Salem Chapel in Ste Catherines. Richard later became a lay minister in the congregation and was ordained as a Deacon of the British Methodist Episcopal Church in 1892.

  "text" : "Rufus Riddlesbarger (born c. 1897) was an American entrepreneur who marketed a line of contraceptive diaphragms in the 1930s. Under the Lanteen Laboratories brand, Riddlesbarger operated a chain of clinics in Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan, which were promoted through radio advertising. Riddlesbarger is believed to have been an Army Air Corps pilot during World War I. He later worked for the U.S. Post Office, flying air mail starting in 1920, but was grounded in 1921 for failing to promptly report a forced landing, resulting in delay to the mail. Riddlesbarger invented a diaphragm that was successfully marketed through his firm, Lanteen Laboratories, using storefront clinics called \"Medical Bureaus of Birth Control Information\" and a variety of media, including radio, direct mailings to doctors, and in packages of sanitary napkins. One of Riddlesbarger's clinic operators, Adele Gordon, was, with her husband John, unsuccessfully prosecuted in 1935 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for selling birth control devices. Lanteen Laboratories had been organized in 1928, with 90% of its stock owned by Riddlesbarger. Lanteen sold a comprehensive line of products, including contraceptive jellies, douches, tampons and suppositories. The proceeds from Riddlesbarger's venture went to purchase a ranch in southern Arizona which he named Lanteen Ranch, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Kinjockity Ranch. Riddlesbarger commissioned Phoenix architect Edward C. Morgan to design the Pueblo Revival house and guest house, and the interior was decorated by designer and sculptor  Raymond Phillips Sanderson. Riddlesbarger, through the Lanteen Arabian Foundation, bred Arabian horses at the ranch, most notably owning Antez, a famous sire originally owned by Will Keith Kellogg. Antez sired Palominos while with Riddlesbarger. Bamboo Harvester, who played Mister Ed in the eponymous television show, was a grandson of Antez. Although he intended to live at the ranch full-time, Riddlesbarger sold the ranch in 1946 and moved to Tucson. He had lost a substantial judgment in tax court over Lanteen's purchase of the ranch lands and subsequent payment of the ranch to him as a dividend. He was unsuccessfully prosecuted in 1948 for statutory rape for an alleged affair with a house servant, and left the United States shortly thereafter. A final divorce decree was granted in favor of his former wife Fay Riddlesbarger in 1948, following proceedings that began in 1931, and allegations of coercion, but further proceedings continued into 1952, reaching the Illinois Supreme Court. Rufus had two daughters with Fay. Legal proceedings in the 1950s indicate that Rufus settled in east Africa in what was then Tanganyika."

  "text" : "Riccardo Quartararo (Sciacca, Sicily, 1443 - Palermo, 1506) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period, active in Sicily and Naples. He painted the images on wood of Saints Peter and Paul now at Palermo museum. The museum had once attributed them to followers of Antonello Crescenzio. His first works in Palermo are a processional banner or Gonfalone (1485) for the Confraternity of Santa Elena in Corleone in 1485 During 1491-1501, he was active in Naples, working with Costanzo Moysis of Venice as a documented in the 1492 will by Quartararo and his wife Antonella Siscorsa. He also painted a Santa Cecilia for the Cathedral of Palermo. Attributed to Quartararo are two painted wood tablets depicting two saints, one of the Saint Margaret, at the Museo Nazionale of the ancient Salvatore Monastery of Palermo. The original condition was poor and they were heavily retouched in later centuries. Also attributed to Quartararo are two wood canvases in private hands of a St John the Baptists and St James Major."

  "text" : "Robert Rhodes McGoodwin (July 6, 1886 - February 25, 1967) was an American architect and educator, best known for his suburban houses in the Chestnut Hill and Mount Airy sections of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was born in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and educated in Philadelphia, graduating from Central High School in 1902. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Architecture in 1907, and received an M.A. from Penn in 1908. He won the 1908 Cresson Traveling Scholarship in architecture, which he used to travel in Europe and study in Paris. Following his return to Philadelphia, he worked briefly for architect Horace Trumbauer, and began teaching at Penn in 1910. That same year he formed a partnership with his former Penn classmate Samuel D. Hawley, that lasted until 1912. He taught at Penn until 1924, and served as a trustee of its School of Fine Arts, 1925-1959. Dr. George Woodward commissioned about 180 houses in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia between 1910 and 1930. McGoodwin designed buildings for Woodward at \"Cotswold Court,\" adjacent to Pastorius Park, including attached houses grouped to look like manor houses. He planned \"French Village\" (1924–29) for Woodward – a luxury housing development on the opposite side of the Cresheim Creek, in Mount Airy – and designed eight of its French-Norman-style buildings, including the gatehouses flanking Emlen Street and the gatehouse at McCallum Street. Additional houses were designed by architects Edmund B. Gilchrist and Willing, Sims & Talbutt. McGoodwin created a massive Tudor fantasy in the Samuel B. Rotan mansion, \"Lane's End,\" in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. Now better known as the Wharton Sinkler Estate, it was modeled after Sutton Place in Guildford, Surrey. McGoodwin assembled architectural fragments and whole rooms from numerous English buildings: the massive oak front doors were salvaged from Muchelny Abbey and date to 739; the stone-slab floors in the hall were salvaged from Warwick Priory and date to 1124. A village of Tudor buildings – some old, some just built to look old – hid the 20th-century services and housed the staff. Mrs. Wharton Sinkler bequeathed the estate to the University of Pennsylvania in 1971, which operated it as a conference center and wedding venue until 1999. It was sold in 2000 for $2 million. Following $4 million in renovations, it was resold in 2005 for $5.5 million. He drew up plans to cloak architect Frank Furness's exuberant, red-sandstone University of Pennsylvania Library (1888–91) in sedate, Collegiate Gothic brick and stone. The first step in this scheme was the Horace Howard Furness Shakespearean Library addition, which McGoodwin designed in 1931. The scheme never went any further, and his inconguous addition to the library is now the Arthur Ross Gallery. He enlarged Penn's student union building, Houston Hall, with a two-story dining hall addition at its east end (now the Hall of Flags) and a student lounge at its west end. He made alterations to the University of Pennsylvania Hospital following a 1937 fire. McGoodwin was active in the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, serving as its president in 1943."

  "text" : "Raymond Phillips Sanderson (1908-1987) was an American artist and sculptor. Sanderson was born in Bowling Green, Missouri and educated at the Art Institute of Chicago under Raoul Josset. He moved to Bisbee, Arizona for his health in 1932, where he worked as an illustrator and sign painter. His first major commission was the Miner's Monument at the Cochise County Courthouse in Bisbee, popularly known as the Copper Man, as well as some reliefs in the interior of the courthouse. He moved to Phoenix in 1937 to teach at the Phoenix Art Center under sponsorship by the Works Progress Administration. In 1939 he was commissioned by industrialist Rufus Riddlesbarger to outfit and decorate his new house at Riddlesbarger's Lanteen Ranch near Sierra Vista. Sanderson received several significant commissions starting in 1940. Working for the United States Maritime Commission, Sanderson sculpted a series of wood relief panels for three ships, the President Jackson, President Monroe, and the President Hayes. He worked as an illustrator and model maker for the Goodyear Aircraft Corporation from 1942 to 1946. In 1946-47 he designed furniture, and from 1947 to 1954 he taught at Arizona State College. Other jobs included work as an illustrator for Motorola in 1957-58 and he was a model maker for the Arizona Highway Department in 1962-1965. Through the entire period he worked on commissioned projects and his own artwork. He received notice in 1973 with a retrospective exhibition at Arizona State University. Sanderson's work is described as non-representational, modern, and derived from the landscape and culture of the American Southwest. Sanderson's 1951 Students Who Gave Their Lives is located on the University of Arizona campus to the south of the Student Union Memorial Center. He moved to Chico, California in 1973, working in printmaking and painting after giving up sculpture over health concerns, having contracted coccidioidomycosis in 1958."

  "text" : "Rudolf Maison (July 29, 1854 – February 12, 1904) German sculptor born in Regensburg, Germany where he began his studies. He continued studying in Munich. His work can be found all over Germany and is in the Romantic tradition. Maison \"often exaggerated to the most impossible degree the baroque frenzy of composition, disregard for the laws of equilibrium, and pictorial proclivities, but he broke sharply with is contemporaries habit of depending, for their forms, on the baroque of the past, and studied his own forms directly from actuality.\" His style contained a \"much more pronounced naturalism\" than was to be found in the works of his German contemporaries and he thus, particularly in his smaller works was able to address themes that had \"heretofore been deemed suitable only for painting\" and \"ruthlessly violated the tradition of pomposity and aloofness\" current in German sculpture. Much of his monumental work, including a Kaiser Frederick I in front of the Bode Museum and an Otto I and two mounted figures placed on the attic level on the Reichstag building have not survived the ravages that Berlin endured. Maison died in Munich as was buried in the Westfriedhof cemetery there."

He was in many other famous movies from as early as Hitchcock's Saboteur in 1942 to as late as Mississippi Burning in 1988. Saunders was lauded by other famous stuntmen, such as Brayton Yerkes and Gary Morgan. Fay Alexander called him, \"without a doubt the best all-around acrobat I've ever known.\" Saunders was the model for Salvador Dalí's painting Christ of Saint John of the Cross. The painting shows Jesus from the viewpoint of God the Father (from above); Saunders was suspended from the ceiling to allow Dalí to visualize the human body under the stress of crucifixion. Saunders was famous for performing at Muscle Beach and for giving free lessons to children. \"This has to be the only place in the world where someone can just walk up and receive free gymnastic instruction from pros\", Saunders told a reporter in 1986. Saunders was not a weightlifter, though. Instead he 'preferred to lift girls'."

  "text" : "Robert Preston, 1st Baron Gormanston (died 1396) was an Anglo-Irish nobleman, statesman and judge. He held several senior judicial offices including, for a brief period, that of Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He was the founder of the leading Anglo-Irish family of Preston whose titles included Viscount Gormanston and Viscount Tara. He was the son of Roger de Preston (died 1346) and his wife and cousin Maud or Matilda de Preston. His father and uncles were the sons of Adam de Preston, a wealthy merchant in Preston, Lancashire; they came to Ireland before 1320. Roger held several judicial offices including justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). Robert is first heard of in 1346 when he inherited property at Preston. He followed his father into the legal profession, becoming Irish King's Serjeant about 1348 and Attorney General for Ireland in 1355. As Law Officer his duties were onerous : in 1357 he was ordered to accompany the Lord Justice of Ireland through Leinster and Munster, and to plead and defend pleas on behalf of the Crown. This assize lasted for almost 6 months, which must have seriously interfered with his private practice, although he received a salary of £29, which was then a very large sum, and his expenses. He became Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas in 1358, and held that office for 20 years. In 1359-61 the English Crown was faced with a serious rebellion in Leinster led by the O'Byrne clan and the MacMurrough-Kavanaghs. King Edward III appointed his second son Lionel of Antwerp as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to put down the rebellion, in which he was largely successful. Preston served as his lieutenant in the campaign and received a knighthood. He was created Baron Gormanston between 1365 and 1370. He had already been summoned to the Irish Parliament as Baron Kells, in right of his first wife, Margaret de Bermingham. In 1367 he sat on a commission to inquire into what profits were due to the English Crown from the Exchequer of Ireland, and later the same year he sat on another commission to inquire into whether the manor of Rathkeale was held from the Crown. Despite his close family ties (through his first wife) with the Bermingham family of Carbury, he suffered considerable losses during the Berminghams' private war in Counties Meath and Kildare in 1367-8 and was forced to garrison Carbury Castle. It is unclear if he played any part in the failed parley at Carbury in 1368 where the de Berminghams, in breach of the truce which had been agreed, imprisoned the Crown's representatives. In his later years he continued to hold high office: he was briefly Lord Chancellor in 1388, deputy Justiciar of Ireland in 1389, and he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland in 1391. He is believed to have possessed a collection of legal and political works, including the controversial treatise Modus Tenendi Parliamentum, which stressed the crucial part played in Government by Parliament, and according to its critics could be read as justifying the deposition of the King. The collection passed to his son the second Baron, who made a keen study of it. This became a cause of controversy in the political crisis of 1418-9, when Robert's son was accused of treason, largely because of his possession of the Modus . His main residence, acquired through marriage, was Carbury, County Kildare; he purchased Gormanston, County Meath from the St. Amand family in 1363. He married firstly Margaret de Bermingham, daughter and eventual heiress of Sir Walter de Bermingham, titular baron of Kells-in-Ossory, through whom he obtained Carbury Castle (which is now a ruin); he married secondly Joanna Hugely. On his death in 1396 he was succeeded by his son Christopher Preston, 2nd Baron Gormanston, who also adopted the title Baron Kells in right of his mother."

  "text" : "Dr. Richard Stephen Muller (born May 5, 1933) is an American professor at the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department of the University of California at Berkeley. He made contribution to the founding and growth of the field of MicroElectromechanical Systems (MEMS). His seminal contribution of polysilicon sacrificially-released beams in 1982 led to a class of micromanufacturing process called surface micromachining. This process preceded the creation of low cost, mass-produced commercial micro accelerometers, which are used in automotive collision sensors for airbag deployment. Together with Richard White, he created BSAC (Berkeley Sensors and Actuators Center), an organization that produced many academic generations of researchers and intellectual properties in the MEMS field, a field that in 2013, accounted for multi-billion dollar revenue worldwide. He is a member of the US National Academy of Engineering."

During his leadership, the Schule des Musikvereins für Steiermark was transformed in 1920 into a Conservatory. In 1939 the Conservatory was divided into two parts, now called the Kunst Universität Graz  and the Johann-Joseph-Fux Konservatorium Graz. His works would be termed late Romantic and show the influence of Max Reger.During his lifetime his works failed to gain wide popularity. As a teacher Mojsisiovics had an influence on Otto Siegl, Hans Holenia, Max Schönherr, Alois Pachernegg  Waldemar Bloch, Alfons Vodosek and Grete von Zieritz [8]"

  "text" : "Robert Shetterly (born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is an American artist. Shetterly is best known for his portrait series, \"Americans Who Tell the Truth,\" a project begun in response to U.S. government actions following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Towers in New York City. Shetterly undertook the project as a way to deal with his own grief and anger by painting Americans who inspired him. He initially intended to paint only 50 portraits, but by 2013 more than 180 portraits were included in the series. Portions of the series tour widely across the United States, being shown in schools, museums, libraries, galleries and other public spaces. A book titled \"Americans Who Tell the Truth,\" written and illustrated by Shetterly, was published by Dutton Juvenile Press in 2005 and reviewed favorably by Kirkus. It won the International Reading Association's Intermediate—Nonfiction award for 2006, and the nonprofit Children's Book Council listed it among the \"2006 Notable Social Studies Trade Books for Young People,\" saying it is \"sure to inspire debate and further research.\". The book also met with criticism. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz reviewed it for FrontPage Magazine in 2005, calling it a “revolting” and “seductive picture book” whose “propaganda” was “a form of literary child abuse.”  Shetterly responded to Dershowitz's attack in the same publication. Shetterly lives with his partner, Gail Page, in Brooksville, Maine."

His primary research contributions were in computer systems design, and associative memories and processors. As a mathmetician, Seeber began his career as section head, actuarial, at the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., from 1932-42. From 1942-45, he did civilian research on submarine, anti-submarine, air, and anti-air operations for the U.S. Navy. He also performed mathematical computing for the Navy. The balance of Seeber's professional life was as a computer architect and inventor at International Business Machines Corp. from 1945-68. Seeber's first project at IBM was the SSEC. He was an advocate of modifiable instruction sets. For this machine was developed the stored-program concept, the basis of modern computing machines. As a senior staff member of the Department of Pure Science for IBM, he was responsible for supervision of the computation and educational activities at the Watson Laboratory. Seeber was also the inventor of the \"Wordwriter\" an IBM Selectric typewriter with a memory capable of storing 42 eighteen-character words and phrases, selected by the operator. Stored words were selected by pressing a foot pedal at the same time as striking the letter to which the word is keyed. The machine featured optional automatic capitalization and hyphenation."

He served two terms in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1900 to 1908. and a single term in the Louisiana State Senate from 1908 to 1912, representing Bienville and neighboring Claiborne parishes. Wimberly served on the Education committees of both houses during his 12-year tenure. Wimberly was the youngest of eleven children of the former Francis Nix and John L. Wimberly, a planter and a native of Georgia who migrated westward to Louisiana in 1840. Rush Wimberly graduated from Arcadia High School, an entity of the Bienville Parish School Board. Having privately thereafter studied the law, he was admitted to the bar in 1894. After his legislative years, Wimberly moved to Shreveport in Caddo Parish in northwestern Louisiana, where he formed the law firm, Wimberly, Reeves and Dorman. He returned to Arcadia and for ten years was the parish attorney for Bienville Parish and for a number of years the parish public school superintendent. Wimberly was an alternate delegate to the 1936 Democratic National Convention, which met in Philadelphia to renominate the Roosevelt-Garner ticket. In 1897, Wimberly married the former Annie May Poland (1877-1960), and the couple had three children. The oldest, Lorris M. Wimberly, served in the state House, including several stints as Speaker. Lorris Wimberly was a political ally of his fellow Democrat, Governor Earl Kemp Long. The other Wimberly children were J. Rush Wimberly, Jr. (1906-1982), an attorney, and Edrie W. Albrecht (1902-1983), the wife of Henry Gustave Albrecht (1899-1945) of Arcadia. Wimberly and most of his family are interred at the Arcadia Cemetery."

  "text" : "Robert A. “Bob” Roth (born March 19, 1947) is an American publisher and art collector who lives in Chicago. He was the founder and publisher of the Chicago Reader, one of the most influential and successful newspapers of its type. He was also one of the founders and the first president of Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art, located in Chicago. Intuit is the only nonprofit organization in the U.S. dedicated solely to presenting “outsider” art by self-taught artists. Roth grew up in Arlington Heights, IL, a suburb of Chicago, and attended Carleton College in Northfield, MN, graduating magna cum laude in 1969. In the fall of that year he began graduate studies in political philosophy at the University of Chicago, but before earning a degree he left school to devote his energies to the Reader, which he started with a group of Carleton friends in 1971. The Reader was one of the first and ultimately one of the most successful in a genre of urban newspapers that came to be known as the alternative weekly. Roth modeled it after New York’s Village Voice and papers he had seen in Boston, but with one important difference: the Reader was unapologetically free, distributed at bookstores, bars, and shops. At the time, free circulation was disreputable. Roth, who was president of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies from 1983 to 1987, proselytized for the free model, and as the Reader prospered papers in other cities began to adopt it. By 1996, when the Village Voice converted to free circulation, the entire industry had followed the Reader’s lead. Roth was publisher of the Reader from 1971 to 1994, editor and publisher from 1975 to 1990, and president of the company until it was sold in 2007. In addition he was president of the company that published Washington City Paper, which was owned by the same group and also sold in 2007. Since then Roth has been president of Quarterfold, Inc., which holds former Reader assets not transferred in the sale, including an interest in Index Newspapers, the company that publishes The Stranger of Seattle and the Portland Mercury in Oregon. Roth began collecting art in the mid-1980s. By 2005 his collection comprised more than 1,000 pieces, most by untrained artists such as Henry Darger, Steve Ashby, and Sam Doyle. In 2008 he was named to Arts & Antiques magazine’s list of 250 “Top Collectors.” He served as president of Intuit (see above) from 1991 to 1996 and remains on the board of directors. The museum’s Robert A. Roth Study Center is named in his honor. He is also a director and the principal owner of Raw Vision, the international journal of outsider art, based in London."

Hudson dropped out of the Liverpool School of Art to join the Women's Royal Naval Service during World War II. Following training in the WRNS she was sent to Bletchley Park, home of the British government's the Government Code and Cypher School. Hudson worked in Hut 8 under cryptanalyst Alan Turing. She never discussed her work at Bletchley Park following the war. After the war Hudson trained as a florist under Constance Spry, and arranged flowers at Claridge's and the Savoy hotels. The Savoy gave her and her husband a suite overlooking the River Thames as a wedding present. Hudson worked as a florist for Somerset Maugham and his wife, the interior designer Syrie Maugham, and was an amateur pianist and watercolorist. Hudson was most notable for her architectural models, being particularly attracted to Georgian architecture. Bath's Building of Bath Collection and Bath's Pump Room contain models made by Hudson. A scale model of Dulwich Picture Gallery made by Hudson stands in the galleries foyer. Hudson made a model of Highgrove, the country house of Charles, Prince of Wales as a present for the Prince and Princess of Wales's wedding in 1981. Hudson was later commissioned by Charles to alter the model when he added a porch to the house. Hudson made models of other private houses, and was reluctant to accept payment for her models. She met her husband, Richard Hudson in 1945. Hudson was serving in the Royal Marines, they married in 1949. She was survived by her husband and their three sons and two daughters, they lived on a farm near Bath. She died in 2013, shortly before her 87th birthday."

Capey is perhaps best known for his work with the British cosmetics firm Yardley of London, where he served as Art Director from 1928 to 1959. During his tenure, Capey was responsible for the distinctive visual styling of Yardley's packaging with their flower and honeybee motifs. However, his wife, Katharine Bertram, whom he married in 1936 and divorced in 1947, worked as his assistant at Yardley, and claimed to have designed the famous Yardley honeybee herself . Capey also controlled other areas of the company's brand image, including its store fittings and fixtures. Capey was also active as an independent painter and sculptor. From 1929 to 1940, he exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Salon. In 1937 he was given the distinction ‘Royal Designer for Industry’ (RDI) by the Society."

In 2010, he was the defence lawyer for Neev Tapiero, a member of Cannabis As Living Medicine (CALM). The case had been initiated by a police raid on CALM's headquarters, which Marzel called \"a totally inappropriate response to an organization that is seeking legitimization to help sick people.\" In a Facebook post, Marzel promised to seek court \"condemnation\" on the police raid and voiced his opposition to the \"dysfunctional medical marijuana program\" run by Health Canada. In Bedford v. Canada, Marzel sought to have Canada's anti-prostitution laws declared unconstitutional, saying that \"there are consenting adults who want to go into\" prostitution. Natasha Falle, a former prostitute, was angered by this statement, responding that 97% of prostitutes are not engaging in prostitution by choice, and that \"the voices of the overwhelming majority of women who want to get out of prostitution are being drowned out by a vocal few.\" In 2013, Marzel served as the defence lawyer for Maxim Popovitch, a medical cannabis seller and grower."

  "text" : "Ruby Florence Hammond PSM (1936 - 16 April 1993) was an Australian indigenous rights campaigner and the first indigenous South Australian to seek election to Federal Parliament. Hammond was born in 1936 in Blackford, an independent indigenous community in South Australia, and was a member of the Tanganekald group of the Ngarridindjeri people of the Coorong.At the age of 32 she became a member of the Council of Aboriginal Women and was active throughout the 1970s and 1980s in the pursuit of equal rights for Aboriginal people including professional roles at the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement, the Department of Personnel and Industrial Relations and the National Australian Women's Consultative Council. She acted as a consultant to the 1977 Australian Law Reform Commission into Aboriginal Customary Laws which considered whether it was desirable to apply Aboriginal customary law to Aboriginals. The Commission's report outlined Aboriginal customary laws were not generally recognised by general Australian law, yet were a significant influence on Aboriginal people. The report recommended that Aboriginal people should have the final say in the recognition of customary law. Hammond was appointed by the Whitlam Government to the Australian National Advisory Committee on International Women's year (1975).In 1980, Hammond advocated for a treaty which recognised Aboriginal sovereignty. Speaking as representative for the Aboriginal Land Rights Support Group, Hammond argued \"we are the national minority; it is a treaty between two nations. The government must agree and recognise that we were here first\".In 1988, she ran in a by-election for the seat of Port Adelaide, becoming the first indigenous South Australian to do so. In 1990, Hammond was appointed Head of the Aboriginal Issues Unit for the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Hammond served as Aboriginal Coordinator for the South Australian Department of Arts and Cultural Heritage from 1991 to 1993. In 1991, she joined with singer Archie Roach to publicly demand an inquiry into the Stolen Generations. In January 1993 Hammond was awarded the Australian Public Service Medal by Her Excellency the Governor of South Australia, Dame Roma Mitchell. She received a posthumous award for equal opportunity achievement in 1993."

  "text" : "Rodney Bell (born February 6, 1971) is a male dancer born in Te Kuiti, North Island, New Zealand. He is internationally famous for physically integrated dance, which is a contemporary modern dance style that combines people with and without physical disabilities. He is of Maori descent, from the Ngāti Maniapoto tribe. He acquired a disability as a result of a motorcycle accident as a young adult that left him paralyzed from below the chest and he depends upon a wheelchair for mobility. His artistic expression demonstrates elements of traditional Maori culture, yet at the same time he's continually seeking new ways to enhance his creative process. He has been dancing professionally since 1994. He began as a founding member of Touch Compass Dance Trust, which is an internationally renowned physically integrated dance company based in Auckland, New Zealand. In 2007, he relocated to California, U.S., to join AXIS Dance Company, based in Oakland, where he remained principal dancer until 2012. He has been nominated for numerous awards. He won an Isadora Duncan Dance Award in 2008 for an ensemble performance with Sonsherée Giles titled \"To Color Me Different,\" performed under AXIS Dance Company, choreographed by Alex Ketley (artistic director of The Foundry). In 2011, he appeared with Sonsherée Giles on So You Think You Can Dance where he performed the duet \"To Color Me Different.\" He has increasingly worked across all forms of media, including film, commercials, modeling, and fashion catwalks. He teaches dance to disabled and non-disabled dancers through workshops and dance intensives. In 2008, he was in the documentary The Art of Movement which was directed by David Levitt Waxman. In 2009, he modeled for Vale (a mining company in Brazil); and in 2010, he did a commercial for Liberty Mutual, San Francisco, California. In March 2013, he was nominated for an Isadora Duncan Dance Award for an ensemble performance with Sonsherée Giles titled \"Full of Words\", performed under AXIS Dance Company, choreographed by Marc Brew."

Born in Stanley, North Dakota, he attended North Dakota State University from 2005 to 2009 and competed in the javelin at a relatively low level. He gradually improved from a personal record of 67.89 m (222 ft 8 3⁄4 in) in 2008 to 69.78 m (228 ft 11 in) in 2009. He cleared seventy metres for the first time in 2012: that year he had a best of 72.60 m (238 ft 2 1⁄4 in) and competed in the qualifying round of the 2012 United States Olympic Trials. In 2013 he placed third at the Mt. SAC Relays before winning at the Drake Relays with a throw of 74.22 m (243 ft 6 in). At the 2013 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships Dolezal had a startling breakthrough. All four of his valid throws at the competition bettered his previous record: he improved from 74.87 m to 76.10 m to 76.93 m and had his best in the fourth round with a throw of 83.50 m (273 ft 11 1⁄4 in). This moved him up to eighth on the all-time American lists and brought him the national title, finishing ahead of reigning NCAA champion Sam Humphreys."

She came to the attention of the Society for Psychical Research and performed séance experiments for them from 1898 onward. Thompson was originally a physical medium, however as physical mediumship was exposed as fraudulent the psychical researcher Frederic W. H. Myers persuaded Thompson to take up trance mediumship. Some psychical researchers were not impressed with her mediumship as it was discovered that her trances were not genuine. Richard Hodgson had six sittings with Thompson and came to the conclusion she was a fraud. Hodgson claimed that Thompson had access to documents and information about her séance sitters. The medium Leonora Piper was described as an American counterpart to Thompson. According to William James after the death of Frederic Myers, Piper claimed to receive messages from Myers for his widow. The messages were warnings that Thompson was a fraudulent medium. In spiritualist literature, Thompson has been referred to by other aliases such as Rosalie Thompson and Mrs. Edmund Thompson."

  "text" : "Roswell Lyman Colt (1779-1856) was an American businessman who made a fortune in the shipping industry, served for decades as governor of the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures, and was an early railroad executive. Colt's parents were Peter Colt (1744-1824) and Sarah Lyman. (Peter's brother was Benjamin Colt (1740-1781), whose grandson would be gunmaker Samuel Colt (1814-1862).) A graduate of Yale University, Peter founded a shipping business that traded with the West Indies, served in the Revolutionary War, served as Connecticut State Treasurer from 1790 to 1794, and went on to help found Paterson, New Jersey. In 1793, he became the superintendent of the S.U.M., replacing Pierre L'Enfant, and later settled in Paterson. Roswell Colt was born on July 20, 1779. In 1811, Roswell married Margaret Oliver (1790-1856), herself the heiress to a shipping fortune. In 1814, he took the post that was once his father's — governor of the S.U.M. — a job he would hold until 1850. He was a director of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and, after he bought 3,000 shares of the Baltimore and Port Deposit Railroad in 1835, a director of the B&PD as well. In 1838, the B&PD merged with three other railroads to create the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore. (This main line survives today as part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.) Colt's service as a railroad executive is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument in Philadelphia. Roswell and Margaret had 13 children: Robert Oliver Colt (1812-1885), John Oliver Colt (1813-1858), James Craig Colt (1815-1865), Elizabeth Sarah Colt (1816-1823), Mary Devereux Colt (1817-1884), Roswell Lyman Colt (1821-Unknown), John Craig Colt (1822-1848), Emily Oliver Colt (1825-Unknown), Morgan G. Colt (1826-Unknown), Thomas Oliver Colt (1829-1869), Margaret Oliver Colt (1830-1871), Ellen Craig Colt (1831-Unknown), and Julia Colt (1835-1909). He died in Paterson on November 22, 1856."

  "text" : "Richard Scott Thomas (December 3, 1925 – July 27, 2013) was an American dancer, educator, and co-founder of the New York School of Ballet along with his wife Barbara Fallis. He is known as a teacher of Eliot Feld and Twyla Tharp Thomas was born on December 3, 1925, in Kentucky. Following his first exposure to a performance by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo – while visiting relatives in Seattle, Washington – he entered the tutelage of Russian ballet dancer and choreographer Bronislava Nijinska in Los Angeles, and Vincenzo Celli and Anatole Vilzak in New York. Thomas subsequently appeared on Broadway in Kiss Me Kate and Billion Dollar Baby. During his early career with the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo and Ballet Theatre, Thomas met fellow dancer Barbara Fallis, whom he married in Cuba in 1950 while both were on tour with the Company Alicia Alonso (later the National Ballet of Cuba). Their son – future Emmy-winning actor and The Waltons star Richard Thomas – was born a year later. Thomas's first teaching experience also occurred there, when Fernando Alonso attempted to develop a school by selecting pupils from a local orphanage and asked Thomas to assist. The Thomases returned to Manhattan to dance with the New York City Ballet from 1953 to 1958. During this time Thomas was a frequent soloist and member of the premiere casts of Todd Bolender's Souvenirs, Balanchine's Jeux, and Jerome Robbins's The Concert (or The Perils of Everybody). Thomas left the New York City Ballet in 1958 to join the circus but soon returned to the city to indulge his overriding desire to teach. Thomas, who was known by his friends and pupils as \"Dick\" or \"Dicky,\" first joined Harry Asmus at a school on Broadway and 54th Street, chiefly working with students from the High School of the Performing Arts. He later was employed at the schools of June Taylor and Robert Joffrey, whose company he escorted to Russia. In 1963 he abandoned a position at American Ballet Theatre to open what would become the New York School of Ballet on West 56th Street, with his wife. Thomas and Fallis alternated shifts at the Pennsylvania Ballet in Philadelphia to fund their fledgling school, out of which Eliot Feld founded the American Ballet Company. In 1969 George Balanchine and Lincoln Kerstein offered the couple the former studios of the School of American Ballet, at 2291 Broadway between 82nd and 83rd Street. Thomas taught well-established and up-and-coming students in his daily classes, including Cynthia Gregory, Debbie Allen, Christine Sarry, Twyla Tharp, Sean Lavery, and Feld. In 1975 following Feld's departure, the couple formed U.S. Terpsichore, as a touring showcase of the most advanced New York School of Ballet students. Daniel Levans (b. 1953) served as co-artistic director and choreographer of the troupe, composed of approximately 25 to 40 members, mostly teenagers – including Thomas's and Fallis's children Richard and Bronwyn Thomas (b. 1960). Their repertory of over 30 ballets included both the classic and the contemporary, such as the work of Merce Cunningham and Levans. Thomas was one of the first ballet directors to arrange performances for schools. The troupe originally appeared in New York City and Kentucky venues, until a 1976–1977 series of nationwide performances contracted with Columbia Artists Management, inc., who insisted the ten-member troupe appear under the title of \"Richard Thomas Theatre Ballet\"; this led to further extensive traveling through the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The revenue from sold-out houses helped fund the school. In 1984 he raised $370,000 to organize and host the First International Ballet Competition with co-founder Ilona Copen; the competition – which unconventionally required all participants to perform the same four pas de deux rather than their own selected dances – still continues to this day. After Fallis's death in 1980, Thomas directed the troupe and operated the School until its forced closure in 1985. He continued to teach, chiefly children, commencing work in 1990 at Feld's Ballet Tech School, which educated minority students at New York City public schools. Thomas eventually retired to a farm in Kentucky, where he committed to an already established second career in dog breeding and showing until his death on July 27, 2013."

In 1891 Gambogi obtained a scholarship to the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence, where he studied under Giovanni Fattori. Among his works, L’uscita della messa was awarded the Florence Prize in 1896, All’ombra displayed at the Fine Arts Exposition adjacent to the Festa dell’Arte e dei Fiori in Florence. In 1898 Gambogi sent Cantire to the National Exposition of Fine Arts at Turin. An example of his work, La veduta sul porto di Livorno, is not a classically beautified vedute, but reminds the viewer that Livorno was a modern port city bustling with stevedores. Similarly, the painting The emigrants depicts a family at a bustling dockside (Museo Giovanni Fattori, Livorno). His wife, Elin Danielson-Gambogi (3 September 1861 – 31 December 1919), was a prominent Finnish painter."

  "text" : "Ruby Jessop (born March 3, 1986) is a former member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and child bride known for her family connections, her 2013 escape from an FLDS-controlled polygamous community, and the criminal probe prompted by her escape. Ruby is the sister of author and ex-FLDS member Flora Jessop. In Flora's book, Church of Lies, she recounts how, as a fourteen-year-old, Ruby called her asking to help her escape after learning that she was to be married off to her second cousin and step-brother, Haven Barlow. Flora writes that while the authorities were contacted, they were unable to locate Ruby as she was being moved from place to place to avoid contact with Flora . FLDS Prophet Warren Jeffs officiated at the wedding of 14-year-old Ruby and Barlow, who was then in his mid-20s. When the two were married, this made Barlow her brother-in-law, second cousin, step-brother and husband. The intermarrying of Fundamentalist Mormon members is very common, as families have many members and only people inside the faith are deemed marriageable. This can result in inbreeding and can cause genetic defects. After Ruby's escape, a press conference was held by Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne with Ruby and her sister Flora to announce not only the escape, but a probe into the alleged FLDS practice of holding women against their will and an investigation of the police force in Colorado City. Horne also intervened and prevented Barlow from keeping Ruby's children away from her. Ruby has appeared on Katie Couric, Oprah, Anderson Cooper: 360°, and appears in Jon Krakauer's non-fiction book Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith. Ruby is cousin-by-marriage of Carolyn Jessop, author of the New York Times Best Seller Escape and ex-FLDS member. She is a relative of Winston Blackmore, the leader of a Canadian polygamous group, and also his uncle John Horne Blackmore, first leader of what became the Social Credit Party of Canada."

  "text" : "Johann Xaver Robert Caspary (29 January 1818, Königsberg – 18 September 1887) was a German botanist. He studied theology and philosophy at the University of Königsberg and was educated in sciences at the University of Bonn. Among his influences at Bonn were zoologist Georg August Goldfuss, astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm August Argelander and botanist Ludolph Christian Treviranus. Afterwards, he spent considerable time in England studying marine and freshwater algae. From 1851 he served as a lecturer at the University of Berlin, where he worked closely with Alexander Braun. In 1859 he returned to Königsberg as a professor of botany and director of the botanical garden. He specialized in the study of aquatic plants, including extensive systematic research involving the family Nymphaeaceae (water lilies). He made significant contributions in the fields of plant anatomy and morphology, being especially interested in growth of the trees and the structure of vascular tissue in plants. His name is associated with the \"Casparian strip\", defined as a secondary thickening in many endodermal cells in the form of a continuous band or strip on the radial and transverse walls."

  "text" : "Robert Neville (1905—February 17, 1970) was an American newspaper and magazine reporter who, in a forty-year career, covered the Spanish Civil War, World War II and the Korean War, working for The New York Times, New York Post, New York Herald Tribune, PM and, starting in 1937, Time magazine, where he remained for two and, subsequently, thirteen years, rising in 1938 to become the publication's foreign news editor. A native of Oklahoma, Robert Neville was born on a ranch near the small city of Vinita and subsequently moved with his family to Wyoming where, living in another small city, Gillette, he worked, at the age of 14, as a hand typesetter for a local newspaper. Starting his higher education at the University of California and then transferring to New York City for a Bachelor of Literature degree at Columbia University, he obtained a Master's degree from Columbia School of Journalism in 1929. While studying for his degrees and for three years after receiving his Master's, he worked as a reporter for The Times, then for the Post and eventually for the Herald Tribune which, in 1936, sent him to Spain for coverage of the civil war which had just erupted there. Some of his battlefield reports were also published in liberal weekly The New Republic. By 1937, after nearly a year in Spain, Neville was back in New York, changing his working environment from that of a daily newspaper to the weekly newsmagazine Time which, the following year, promoted him to the position of foreign news editor. Frequently traveling to the Polish capital, Warsaw, in the tense months preceding the outbreak of World War II, he witnessed, on September 1, 1939, the first day of the war, as Hitler's army invaded Poland. Coming back again to New York, Neville decided on a return to daily newspaper work, joining, as one of the initial reporters, the newly founded (in June 1940) leftist afternoon daily PM, which did not accept advertising and resembled a weekly newsmagazine in its reliance on large photographs and stapled pages. Offered the same position he held at Time, foreign news editor, Neville remained with PM until December 1941 when, in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, he entered the Army as a private, at the age of 36. Quickly promoted to staff sergeant and receiving an assignment to the publications division, he was sent to North Africa where he became a co-founder of the Armed Forces newspaper Stars and Stripes edition covering the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II. After the liberation of Rome, the paper moved its headquarters to the Italian capital where Neville, now holding the rank of captain, with quick future promotions to major and then lieutenant colonel, served as its editor and publications officer. In January 1946, eight months following the end of the war in Europe, Neville gave up his Army commission for civilian life in New York, but soon thereafter decided on a return to Europe, rejoining Time as its Rome bureau chief. It was also in Rome, that a year later, at the age of 42, Neville married Mary Sentinelli. Continuing to report from abroad, Neville was subsequently appointed as chief of Time–Life bureaus in Istanbul, Hong Kong, Buenos Aires and New Delhi, but ultimately deciding to live permanently in Rome, retiring from the publishing conglomerate in 1959, when he was 54. Continuing to work as a freelance writer, he authored The World of the Vatican, a 1962 book which examined the workings of the city-state's government, as well as contributing numerous articles to diverse publications, including Encounter, Harper's, Look, as well as The New York Times Magazine and The New York Times Book Review, Sunday supplements of his earliest employer during the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1967, during a skiing vacation in Switzerland, Robert Neville suffered a debilitating stroke which greatly diminished his writing ability and undermined his health, ultimately leading to his death three years later in Rome where, on February 19, 1970, two days after his death, a funeral service was held at St. Paul's Within the Walls Episcopal Church. He was 64 years old and was survived by his wife."

  "text" : "Roy W. Allen (September 30, 1882 – March 26, 1968) was an American entrepreneur who is best known for being a founder and namesake for A&W Root Beer and A&W Restaurants. Allen was born in Illinois in 1882 to a Mr. and Mrs (née Davis) Allen. From there he headed west to California, working as a hotelier. During his time as a hotelier, Allen came across a chemist or pharmacist, while doing business in Arizona. He had told Allen that he had allegedly perfected a mix for root beer. Intrigued by the prospect, Allen eventually purchased that recipe. He then opened a stand to sell it at Lodi, California in June 1919, originally charging 5¢. The first mugs of the drinks were sold to returning soldiers from the First World War. During that era, prohibition had helped the sale of soft drinks across the United States, and Allen found success in his root beer stand. The drink gained the name \"A&W Root Beer\" in 1922 when an employee of Allen's stand in Stockton, Frank Wright, joined Allen in a partnership. The following year, A&W opened its first drive-in restaurant, located in Sacramento. Though Frank Wright was bought out another year later, the chain of root beer stands retained the same name. In 1925, with restaurants already in California, Texas and Utah, Allen set out to expand and franchise the chain, becoming the first franchise of drive-in restaurants in the United States, with just under 200 locations in the Western and Midwestern United States by 1930. To ensure a consistent product across franchises, Allen used a system where the top-secret root beer concentrate was sold to each franchise owner. By 1941, there were around 260 stands across the United States, though World War II created problems for Allen's chain due to shortages in product and employees, with multiple franchises going out of business. However, as the war came to an end, the chain went on to expand once again. Allen retired in 1950, selling the root beer business to a Nebraskan businessman, Gene Hurtz. He died in 1968."

Garofalo resides with his wife, the former Joan Seibert, in Meraux, a census-designated place in St. Bernard Parish. Garofalo won the state House position in the general election held on November 19, 2011, when he defeated the Democrat, Chad Lauga, 7,153 (53.3 percent) to 6,262 (46.7 percent). The incumbent Democrat Reed S. Henderson did not seek reelection. Garofalo in his first term was assigned to the House (1) Civil Law and Procedure, (2) Judiciary, and (3) Natural Resources and Environment committees. The Louisiana Association of Business and Industry rated Garofalo 89 percent, with a 78 percent score for the 2013 session alone. In the 2012, session Garofalo was the subject of an ultimately unsuccessful recall instigated by disgruntled professional educators in his district who object to his conservative House votes on issues related to school vouchers and education reform which had been popular positions shown in public opinion polls during the 2011 election period."

Serpas Ph.D. (born circa 1961) is an American university professor at Loyola University New Orleans who served as the Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department from May, 2010 until his resignation on August 18, 2014, having been appointed to that post by Mayor Mitch Landrieu. He was succeeded as Superintendent by Michael S. Harrison. Ronal Serpas began his law enforcement career with the New Orleans Police Department in June, 1980 and rose through the ranks to become Assistant Superintendent and Chief of Operations in October, 1996, serving in that post under then-Superintendent Richard Pennington until July, 2001. Prior to returning to the New Orleans Police Department, he served as Chief of the Washington State Patrol in the Cabinet of Governor Gary Locke from August, 2001 until January, 2004, and as Chief of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department from January, 2004 until May, 2010. During his service as New Orleans Police Superintendent, he was also a member of the Governing Body of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Serpas was Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department during the three years investigated by the Office of the Inspector General, which resulted in a report indicating that 1,111 cases of rape went unreported and/or were not investigated. In June 2015 the New Orleans Police Department reported that during the course of the investigation, PIB learned that a majority of the 840 cases classified as 21 Complaints were not related to a call for service regarding criminal activity. Rather, the cases were Sex Offender Checks. A Sex Offender Check occurs when an officer conducts an investigation on a registered sex offender to ensure that they are following all required protocols. The documentation is maintained in a filing system separate from the SVS."

Alai, who used to run the now defunct information technology weblog at Techmtaa.com has earned notoriety for his relentless stream of social rants that misleads, somewhat entertains and, not unusually, embarrass public officials in equal measure. He has been sued and briefly incarcerated for his highly opinionated political and sometimes personal attacks on politicians, government officials and business leaders. A self-styled screamer and voice of the voiceless, Alai's intrepid and gung-ho pursuit for positive action, and his almost rabid distaste for slow processes or corporate bureaucracy has turned him into an icon for justice, albeit in a fashion different from common civil society. Robert Alai has been engaged in political causes, organizing and leading demonstrations against the excesses of Kenyan parliamentarians, as well as openly supporting the presidential campaigns of the Cord Coalition in the 2013 general elections. Alai also led the opinion of Cord supporters, accepting the victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition, and asking other Kenyans of goodwill to respect and support the new government. He also contributed to social causes, such as offering financial support to the ailing former Kenyan woman boxing legend Conjestina Achieng. In the wake of the Westgate shopping mall attack in Nairobi where over 65 people were killed, Alai was praised, both by local and international media for his timely and creative use of social media, mainly Twitter, to provide updates of what was happening at the mall. In a world of virtual media shut down by a government keen to spin the narrative to its own public image purposes, Alai virtually became the go-to person for the alternative, more accurate view. He was constant in his tweeting, all day and night long, reporting each and every significant happening. His accounts were considered as being more accurate than - and sometimes contradicting - the updates provided by the authorities. The mainstream media, and public discourse was largely formed and directed around his reports and views, including the emergence of the alleged disagreement among the security agencies that had resulted in the deaths of several security operatives, as well as the widely condemned looting of the besieged mall. Only much later did the Government acknowledge the stories he had broken to the Kenyan public. Alai's social media footprint is huge, by average African standards. He estimates that he makes 50 million weekly social media impressions, making him perhaps Africa's most visible private citizen on the internet. In December 2014, Ndegwa Muhoro, the Kenya CID Chief, ordered the arrest of Robert Alai for allegedly sharing President Uhuru Kenyatta's contacts on Twitter. He was consequently charged \"with undermining Uhuru\". Alai's twitter handle @robertalai was suspended on 18 December 2014, but was later reinstated."

  "text" : "Ronald \"Ron\" Pederson (born January 8, 1978) is an award winning Canadian actor, improviser and theatre director who has performed extensively throughout Canada and in the United States. He has worked with most of Canada's major theatres including The Stratford Festival, The Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, The Citadel Theatre, Alberta Theatre Projects, The Arts Club, The Vancouver Playhouse, The Young Centre, The Canadian Stage Company, The Tarragon Theatre, Theatre Passe Muraille, Soulpepper and The SummerWorks Festival. Born in Edmonton, Alberta, Pederson began working professionally at the Citadel Theatre and The Phoenix Theatre and with award-winning playwright Stewart Lemoine's Teatro La Quindicina and the Edmonton International Fringe Festival at a very young age. In 1995, at the invitation of Dana Andersen, Pederson joined the cast of the live improvised Soap Opera Die-Nasty. Over the next eight years Ron performed weekly on the Soap, worked with notable guest stars Mark McKinney, Mike Myers and Joe Flaherty, and completed the Die-Nasty Annual 53-Hour Soap-A-Thon. In 2002 Pederson won a Sterling Award for his portrayal of Ray Dooley in Martin McDonagh's play The Beauty Queen of Leenane. He is an eight time Sterling Award nominee. Pederson was discovered in Hollywood while improvising at The Second City with Martin Short, Catherine O’Hara and Fred Willard in Joe Flaherty's Improvised Show The Soap Also Rises in March, 2002. That year he turned down an invitation to join the Toronto's The Second City Main Stage Cast to begin work on FOX's sketch comedy television series MADtv that September. He would perform with them for three seasons and was nominated for a Canadian Comedy Award for Best Television Performance for his work on MADtv: Season 10. Following his departure from MADtv Pederson went on to write and perform original sketches on CBS's The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson for one season before deciding to return to Canada and to dedicate himself to the stage. He moved to Toronto in 2007 where he played Seymour in Little Shop of Horrors at The Canadian Stage Company and has since worked at Tarragon Theatre, Theatre Passe Muraille, The Summerworks Festival and The Toronto Fringe Festival. Back in Edmonton he played Quasimodo in Catalyst Theatre's Hunchback, which also played in Vancouver, and James in the world-premiere of the Sterling Award winning play Extinction Song written and directed by Ron Jenkins, which also played in Toronto (Summerworks Spotlight Award) and in Halifax (Merritt Award Nomination). In Vancouver his performance of Carmen Ghia in The Producers at the Arts Club earned him a Jessie Richardson Award Nomination. He joined the Acting Company of the Stratford Festival in 2013 playing Launcelot Gobo in The Merchant of Venice. Pederson's recent film and television credits include providing the voice of the Golly Gee Kid in the YTV cartoon SIDEKICK, guest starring on Colin Mochrie's sitcom, She's the Mayor, CBC's InSecurity and Degrassi: The Next Generation, as well as playing Frank, one of the villains in the Family Film Vampire Dog. In October 2008, with Matt Baram and Naomi Snieckus, Pederson became a founding member and Co-Artistic Director of the three time Canadian Comedy Award Winning Improv Theatre Company The National Theatre of the World. They began producing two weekly shows in Toronto: Impromptu Splendor: an improvised one-act play and The Carnegie Hall Show, an improvised Variety Show. Later they went on to produce The Soaps, a serialized, improvised Soap Opera and Fiasco Playhouse, an evening of improvised theatrical experiments. In 2009 The National Theatre of the World won the RBC Arts Professional Award. Pederson, Baram and Snieckus went on to perform their shows as part of Toronto's Summerworks Theatre Festival, The Young Centre for the Performing Arts’ Global Cabaret Festival, at Theatre Passe Muraille in Toronto, Off-Broadway at the Barrow Street Theatre in New York City, in Chicago, Los Angeles, Charleston, Edmonton, Halifax and in Europe. In October 2011, Pederson won a Canadian Comedy Award for Best Male Improviser for his work with the National Theatre of the World. Pederson left The National Theatre of the World in 2012 and co-founded a new company called The Theatre Department with Daniela Vlaskalic the same year. The Theatre Department is an \"artist driven theatre dedicated to awakening the imagination. The Theatre Department is committed to engaging with Canada's best Actors, Directors and Designers. [Their] intention is to produce simple, elegant productions of the world's best language-based plays, both new and vintage, with an emphasis on accentuating the power of theatre's singular, live dynamic.\" Their first production was Stewart Lemoine's The Exquisite Hour (2012) at the Factory Theatre starring Ted Dykstra, with Pederson in his directorial debut. The company's second production was Lemoine's Pith! (2014) at Theatre Passe Muraille. Ron was nominated for a 2014 Dora Mavor Moore Award for Best Actor for Pith!

  "text" : "Roberta Michnick Golinkoff holds the Unidel H. Rodney Sharp Chair in the School of Education at the University of Delaware and is also a member of the Departments of Psychological and Brain Sciences and Linguistics and Cognitive Science. An award-winning author of 14 books and over 150 professional articles on early childhood and infant development, she founded and directs the Child's Play, Learning, and Development Laboratory (formerly called The Infant Language Project), which investigates how young children learn their native language . Among her current projects is the creation of a computerized language assessment for preschoolers called the QUILS: Quick Interactive Language Screener. Created with Jill de Villiers, Aquiles Iglesias, Kathy Hirsh-Pasek and Mary Wilson with a grant from the Institute for Education Sciences, the screener is dialect and culture free, measures receptive vocabulary, syntax, and children's language learning abilities, and takes 15-minutes to administer on a touch screen. It will be brought out by Brookes Publishing in the Winter of 2017. She is also involved with Kathy Hirsh-Pasek of Temple University and the Brookings Institution and David Dickinson of Vanderbilt University, on a project to teach vocabulary to disadvantaged preschoolers through playful learning. Research on the conceptual underpinnings of language has brought her to the study of event perception in infants and how language itself may influence infants' attention to the events their language encodes. In addition to her research on language acquisition, Dr. Golinkoff is also an expert on the importance of play and playful learning for children's development, learning, and education. \"Guided play,\" the construct that she and her collaborators Kathy Hirsh-Pasek and Deena Weisberg continue to develop, is an alternative to direct instruction and free play. She is also studying how preschoolers learn about space and geometric forms with an eye to contributing to the improvement of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) teaching in the United States. That research is supported by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences./Her research has been supported by funding from national agencies, including the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Institute of Education Sciences. Dr. Golinkoff served as an Associate Editor of Child Development, one of the premier research journals in her field, and serves on many advisory boards for organizations devoted to children's well being and education. Dr. Golinkoff is a fellow of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychological Society. Dr. Golinkoff is determined to disseminate the findings of her field and speaks all over the world to both lay and professional audiences. She also can be found on Twitter (@KathyandRo1), and through her blogs at the Huffington Post and the Brookings Institution. Her new book, Becoming Brilliant (2016, APA Press), written for parents, practitioners, and policy makers, organizes a large body of psychological and educational literature to present the six skills that are essential for children's academic, personal, and career success in the 21st century. It was launched at the Brookings Institution, followed by a panel, as it fits within their Skills for a Changing World framework. Dr. Golinkoff also consults with toy companies, governmental bodies, children's museums and libraries, and a variety of organizations dedicated to bettering children's and families' lives. She is committed to translating developmental science for use in the world. In addition, she is one of the founders of the Ultimate Block Party movement, an event that took place in Central Park to celebrate playful learning. It attracted over 50,000 people. Other Ultimate Block Parties were held in Toronto, Canada, and Baltimore, Maryland. She is now working in partnership with the Association of Children's Museums to spread block parties. She is also a founder of the Urban Thinkscape Project, designed to bring playful learning to urban areas to encourage parent-child interaction. The first installation will be placed in Philadelphia, PA."

Ri was appointed Chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army in August 2013 as well as promoted to general around the same time. In early February 2016, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that Ri had recently been executed on charges of corruption and forming a political faction. The unconfirmed rumour was widely circulated in mass media. In May 2016 the South Korean government announced that he appeared to be still alive. Ri was shown in official North Korean state media accounts of the historic event of the first Workers' Party Congress held in North Korea in 36 years. The same South Korean government official who in February stated that Ri was \"[executed] for factionalism, misuse of authority, and corruption\" concluded that he had incorrect information and \"we [South Korea] came to believe that he was not executed.\" It was announced during the May 2016 Party Congress that Ri had been appointed a member of the Central Committee of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, as well as its Central Military Commission. General Ri was named an alternate member of the Politburo."

  "text" : "Rabindra Nath Mohapatra (born 1 September 1944) is an Indian theoretical physicist, known for his work on the seesaw mechanism in neutrino physics. Mohapatra was born in the small village Musagadia in Mayurbhanj State. He studied at Utkal University in Bhubaneswar (bachelor's degree 1964) and the University of Delhi (master's degree 1966). In 1969 he earned his PhD under Robert Marshak at the University of Rochester. Subsequently he was a post-doc at Stony Brook University and at the University of Maryland. In 1974 he became an assistant professor and in 1976 associate professor at City College of CUNY under Bunji Sakita. In the academic year 1980/1 he was a visiting professor at Max Planck Institute for Physics. Since 1983 he has been a professor at the University of Maryland. He was a visiting professor at CERN (1976, 1981, 1985), at SLAC, at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and at Brookhaven National Laboratory. From 2005 to 2007 he was a visiting professor at TU München. Mohapatra works on GUTs, unified theories of elementary particles, and neutrino physics. In particular he, with G. Senjanovic, developed in the 1970s left-right symmetric unified theories (which are then spontaneously broken to the observed theories of electroweak interactions with parity violation.) with prediction of a neutrino mass. In 1980/81 Mohapatra was an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow and in 2005 he received the Humboldt Prize. In 2009 he received an honorary doctorate from North Orissa University in India (2009). Since 1987 he has been a member of the Indian Academy of Sciences."

  "text" : "John Rutherford Boyd (1882, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – 1951, Leonia, New Jersey) was a 20th-century American sculptor, painter and illustrator. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he studied under Thomas Anshutz. He worked as a commercial illustrator in Philadelphia, and was art director for the magazine The Ladies' Home Journal from 1909 to 1915. He moved to New York City to become art director for Everybody's Magazine. Boyd revamped the magazine's layout under editor Howard Wheeler, but both their tenures at Everybody's were short. Boyd next worked as art director at Squibb & Company (now Bristol-Myers Squibb). He attended evening classes at the Art Students League of New York. His illustration work appeared on the covers of national magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post. During the 1920s and 1930s, he exhibited regularly at the annual International Exhibition of Watercolors at the Art Institute of Chicago. He was a member of the American Watercolor Society, the Salmagundi Club, and the Architectural League of New York. Although his commercial art was realistic, he also created abstract sculptures and drawings. These intensely geometric works were the subject of a 1937 short film, Parabola, by Mary Ellen Bute and Ted Nemeth, with music by Darius Milhaud. At the invitation of abstract artist Josef Albers, Boyd was a guest lecturer at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. With his friend J. Ernest G. Yalden, he designed the Yalden Memorial Sundial (1937), at Waterfront Park, in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. He married fellow PAFA alumna Harriet A. Repplier, and they had two children, Lydia, born 1914 and David, born 1918. The couple bought the Cole-Allaire House at 112 Prospect Street in Leonia, New Jersey in 1916, and spent three years restoring it. They renamed it \"Boyd's Nest,\" and lived there until their deaths. The house is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. His watercolor, Flower Garden, Irises and Poppies (1929), sold at Sotheby's New York, on September 24, 2008, for $43,750 – an auction record for the artist."

  "text" : "Robert Steel (15 May 1827 – 9 October 1893) was a Presbyterian minister in colonial Australia. Steel was of Scotch extraction, but was born at Pontypool, Monmouthshire, Wales, the son of James Steel and Anne Gillespie his wife. He was educated at the Ayr Academy and at the Aberdeen and Edinburgh Universities, being licensed to preach by the Free Presbytery of Irvine in 1851. He subsequently held various charges, being transferred to Halford in 1855 and to Cheltenham in 1859. He meanwhile contributed to the religious press, and was the originator and for four years one of the editors, of Meliora, a quarterly periodical of social science. In 1861 he was created Ph.D. of the University of Göttingen. In 1861 Steel was appointed to the pastorate of the Macquarie Street church, Sydney, where he arrived in June 1862. Subsequently he took a leading part in promoting the union of the Presbyterian churches of New South Wales, and was elected Moderator of the third General Assembly in 1867. He was actively interested in the establishment of St Andrew's College, University of Sydney, and he has been one of the General Assembly's tutors in theology. For five years he edited the Presbyterian, a weekly paper in Sydney. In 1869 he was adjudged guilty of contempt of court for having published a letter from a missionary exposing the evils of the Polynesian labour traffic, and which it turned out had reference to the proceedings of a captain who was awaiting trial for the murder of kidnapped South Sea Islanders. The Chief Justice, Sir Alfred Stephen, dissented from the decision, and Steel was the object of much popular sympathy, evidenced by addresses and presentations. Along with William Ridley, Steel was granted government aid for the Maloga mission. Steel was created D.D. by Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, and in 1874 was transferred to the pastorate of St. Stephen's Church, Phillip Street, Sydney. In the same year Steel visited the New Hebrides, in the Dayspring, in order to see the working of the missions, in which he had always taken a deep interest, and published a book on the subject in 1880. Amongst other works, Steel is author of the following: Doing Good, or the Christian in Walks of Usefulness (1858); Samuel the Prophet, and the Lessons of his Life and Times (1860); Lives made Sublime by Faith and Work (1861); Burning and Shining Lights, or Memoirs of Good Ministers of Jesus Christ (1864); The Christian Teacher in Sunday Schools (1867); The Shorter Catechism with Analyses, Illustrations, and Anecdotes (1885); and The Achievements of Youth (1891). All the above were published by Messrs. Nelson & Sons, of Edinburgh. Steel married at Huntly, Scotland, on 23 November 1853, Miss Mary Allardyce; he died at North Sydney on 9 October 1893 and was buried in the Presbyterian section of Rookwood Cemetery, survived by three married daughters and three sons."

  "text" : "Before the start of the American Civil War, Rose had studied medicine, received a diploma and moved to Hawkinsville, Georgia. When the war broke out in 1861, Rose joined the Confederate Army's Tenth Georgia Regiment as a foot soldier, but was quickly reassigned to Williamsburg, Virginia, where he worked in the army's medical department. Due to a personal injury, Rose was honorably discharged in December 1861, but his services in creating medicines for the Confederate army continued until just before the end of the war. After the war, Rose moved to Atlanta. In 1867, he founded the R. M. Rose Co. Distillery, also known as the Mountain Spring Distillery, in Vinings, Georgia, a then-small community twelve miles north of Atlanta. He sold his corn and rye whiskies to the public from retail outlets he owned and operated in Atlanta. According to some accounts, his company established the whiskey brand Four Roses in 1888, likely named in honor of him, his brother Origen, and their two sons. The brand is still produced, and was the top selling brand of Bourbon in the United States in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. The brand is currently owned by the Kirin Brewery Company of Japan and produced at the Four Roses distillery in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky. However, the actual origin of the Four Roses brand is not well established, and current brand owners do not mention Rufus M. Rose in their version of its history. In addition to selling liquor, Rose was the owner of a large real estate business known as the Rose Investment Company. Rose died of heart failure on July 21, 1910, in his Victorian mansion - the Rufus M. Rose House - which still stands on Peachtree Street in the SoNo district of Atlanta. His remains are interred in the Rose mausoleum at Oakland Cemetery."

He was a competent artist from and early age with a fascination for marine subjects. In 1900 he sketched the very discreet launch of the \"Mikasa\", the Japanese flagship built by Vickers in Barrow, and had his drawing published in the London Daily Graphic. As a result of this coup, he was invited to move to London and did so in 1902. He started his career with commissions for pencil illustrations for several publications such as Picturesque Westminster, Westminster Abbey and Parish Churches, The County of London and The Bridges of London. His drawings in Halls of the Livery Companies of the City of London were re-published in 1981 by the Worshipful Company of Chartered Surveyors to mark their grant of livery status. Richard Penton served in WW1 in the Sherwood Foresters, surviving the war, and emerging as a Lieutenant (Brevet Captain) in 1919. During that time he continued to draw and paint in France. He went on to become a noted marine and landscape painter, a founder member of the Langham Sketching Club and the Wapping Group of Artists. The London Metropolitan Archives owns the Penton Collection, comprising 130 pencil drawings. He met and married Ciceley Urmson Heinekey in the interwar period. She was an editor and journalist, starting her professional life working with Walter Hutchinson, publisher of literary magazines, later joining Fleetway Publications editing women's magazines throughout WW2. They had two sons—Richard Penton and John Howard Penton—both became practising architects."

Harada qualified to compete in the men's 470 class at the 2012 Olympic Games by finishing sixth at World Championships in Barcelona, Spain. Teaming with Yoshida in the opening series, Harada skippered a spirited challenge on the fifth leg to deliver the Japanese duo a seventh spot in that leg, but they fell short of the medal race with an eighteenth-place finish on 131 net points."

  "text" : "Rolf Hosfeld (born June 22, 1948) is the Academic Director of the Potsdam Lepsius House in Germany, a Research Center for Genocide Studies, and works as an independent writer and historian. After graduating the Johannes Althusius Gymnasium in Bad Berleburg, Hosfeld was trained in journalism at the newspaper Westfälische Rundschau. He studied German language and literature, political science, modern history, and philosophy in Frankfurt and West Berlin, completing an M.A. in West Berlin in 1976 and going on to earn a doctoral degree there. His doctoral dissertation on Heinrich Heine is widely considered to have paved the way for a new, postmodern approach to Heine, on whom he has continued to publish. Hosfeld has worked as a lecturer at Free University of Berlin, editor of the reviews konsequent and omnibus, editor at a Berlin publishing house, member of the editorial board of the monthly Merian, deputy editor-in-chief of the monthly Der Feinschmecker, chief editor of the feature pages of the Hamburg weekly Die Woche, editor-in-chief of the book series Kulturverführer, and as a film and television producer in Berlin. He has produced some fifty films, directing fifteen himself, among them a four-part series on fascism as a pan-European phenomenon and a three-part series on post-1945 civil wars in Eastern Europe. Hosfeld has been member of the Verband deutscher Schrifsteller (VS, the German Writers’ Union) since 1982 and has served on the Board of Directors of the Peter Weiss Foundation for Art and Politics since 2002. In addition to extensive journalism, essays, and travel writing, he has produced numerous scholarly articles, films, and television and radio programs, as well as some twenty books on modern culture and modern and contemporary history. Since 2004, he has been active essentially as an independent author and historian. His history of the Armenian Genocide (2005) continues to generate broad public discussion. His most ambitious project to date has been a four-volume History of the Germans 1815-2007, with accompanying DVDs by Hermann Pölking. Besides this he has published a history of the GDR and a biography of the Jewish-German writer and satirist Kurt Tucholsky. The social-democratic Friedrich Ebert Foundation awarded him its prize “Das politische Buch” (the political book) in 2010 for his book Karl Marx: An Intellectual Biography (German title: Die Geister, die er rief. Eine neue Karl-Marx-Biographie), that has already been translated into several languages. Rolf Hosfeld lives in the countryside near Potsdam."

He was born in Margate, and spent several years of his childhood in Australia. On returning to the UK with his mother after his parents separated he attended the Hastings Grammar School, and received an honours degree from Keble College, Oxford. He worked first for the Daily Mail in London, and then went to Northern Rhodesia where he was co-founder and editor of the African Mail (also known as the Central African Mail) with Alexander Scott. After Zambia's independence, he became editor of the Times of Zambia owned by Tiny Rowland. In 1967 he returned to England as African correspondent of The Observer, and was a proponent of its ultimately unsuccessful fight for independence. In 1986, after failing to become the editor of The Observer when it was purchased by Rowland, he founded his own financial and political bulletin Africa Analysis."

  "text" : "Richard M. Bowen III is an American banker who blew the whistle on mortgage fraud at Citigroup that helped trigger the sub-prime mortgage crisis. A senior vice president at Citigroup, Bowen served as the chief underwriter of the financial services conglomerate's Consumer Lending Group. Bowen's responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's creditworthiness. Beginning in June 2006, Bowen began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses. His group bought and sold $90 billion of residential mortgages annually. When Bowen first blew the whistle in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective, but were fraudulent. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On 3 November 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin and the bank's chief financial officer, head auditor and the risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group's internal controls had broken down. He requested an outside investigation of his business unit. The investigation revealed that Bowen was right, and that the Consumer Lending Group had suffered a breakdowns of internal controls since 2005, Bowen's warnings were ignored, despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which he pointed out. Despite his warnings, Citigroup CEO Charles Prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Citigroup stripped Bowen of most of his responsibilities and informed him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked him to testify about Citigroup's role in the mortgage crisis, and he did so, appearing as one of the first witnesses before the Commission in April 2010."

During his 1981–1983 active career, Turner threw and batted right-handed; he stood 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 190 pounds (86 kg). His association with the California Angels began in June 1981, when he was selected by them in the ninth round of the 1981 Major League Baseball Draft. Turner spent three seasons at the Rookie and Class A levels in the Angel farm system, appearing in 200 minor league games played, and batting .243 with two home runs and 61 runs batted in. He later became the Angels' bullpen catcher, and spent the 1992 and 1993 seasons as a full-time coach on the Angel staff under manager Buck Rodgers and interim skipper John Wathan. He was among the injured on May 21, 1992, when one of the Angels' team buses crashed on the New Jersey Turnpike while en route from New York to Baltimore. Turner sustained a wound to his torso that required 26 stitches to close. He was reassigned by the Angels after the 1993 season. As of 2013, he is a corporate sales account executive for the Angels."

  "text" : "Ramin (Ron) Najafi (Persian: رامین نجفی ‎‎) was born in Tehran, Iran in 1958. He completed his primary education and received his high school diploma from Alborz High School in Tehran. In 1976, he immigrated to the United States to pursue his passion of becoming a chemist. He began his undergraduate degree in pharmacy at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After earning a B.S. and M.S. in chemistry under the guidance of Professor John Soderquist at the University of San Francisco, he then received his Ph.D. at University of California at Davis under the tutelage of Prof. Emeritus George Zweifel[i]. Post-Ph.D., He worked at Sigma-Aldrich, Rhone Poulenc Rorer (now Sanofi), and PerkinElmer-Applied Biosystems before leaving to found CP Lab Safety and NovaBay Pharmaceuticals. Najafi is an innate innovator. With more than 50 patents & pending patent applications, including a class of non-antibiotic, antimicrobial compounds named Aganocides®. The leading molecule of this aganocide family of compounds, auriclosene, has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Auriclosene is chemically stable and has an extremely low probability of developing resistance. NovaBay is developing a formulation of Auriclosene to be used against eye, skin, and urinary tract infections. These products are currently in FDA monitored clinical trials. The products are intended to replace current classical antibiotics used in eye, skin, and urinary tract infections. Ron Najafi championed development of NeutroPhase for wound care. In September 2013, working together with John Crew, MD (vascular surgeon) they developed Crew-NovaBay minimally invasive surgical procedure to treat flesh eating bacteria. NeutroPhase has been successfully used in over 40 cases diagnosed as flesh eating infection. NeutroPhase has shown in a number of critical scientific publications to neutralize the key toxins responsible for the flesh eating disease. In 2014, Ron Najafi and her sister, Kathryn (Katy) Najafi, MD (Ophthalmologist & Surgeon) discovered a unique formulation of NeutroPhase to help manage patients suffering from Blepharitis. This unique formulation was initially called i-Lid Cleanser and later changed name to AVENOVA. Katy was so impressed with the performance of Avenova, she was able to convince the entire management and the board of NovaBay to focus the resources of the company on AVENOVA. Today, AVENOVA is the leading product for the management of Blepharitis, MGD and Dry Eye. Najafi currently heads Emery Pharma located in Emeryville, California."

  "text" : "Robert Alfred Herman (1861–1927) was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who coached many students to a high wrangler rank in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos. Herman was senior wrangler in 1882. He had his earliest showings as a coach in 1895 when C. Godfrey ranked fourth wrangler, and in 1897 when P. H. Ezechiel also came in fourth. In 1898 Herman coached A. H. Pocck who came eighth and C. S. Lloyd who came tenth. In 1899 his students included seventh, ninth, and tenth wranglers. In 1900 senior wrangler J. E. Wright was his student, and his textbook A Treatise on Geometrical Optics was published. In 1903 Harry Bateman was senior, P. E. Marrak second, and G. F. S. Hills fifth under Herman’s coaching. Arthur Eddington was senior wrangler in 1904, and Herman had four other students in the ranks of the top ten wranglers. J. E. Littlewood (1905) and Arunachala Tyaga Rajan (1906) were senior wranglers, E. H. Neville came second in 1909, and many other students of Herman made it into the top ranks of wranglers before the ranking was abolished. In the early days of Tripos, coaches were in private business in rooms off-campus. In the 1880s and 1890s instruction at college improved to the point that coaches merely supervised their students’ progress. Under these conditions the tradition of private coaching fell away, and fellows such as Herman coached students. Each year Herman gave a course in differential geometry. His students James Jeans, Harry Bateman, and Arthur Eddington, among others, later proved their facility with methods of differential geometry as they developed the theories of electromagnetism and relativity of spacetime. Andrew Forsyth reviewed the history of Tripos, and wrote, \"my old friend, R. A. Herman, who died a few years ago, a man of unusual manipulative skill, a great and stimulating teacher, the last of the great coaches.\""

  "text" : "Raymond A. Johnson, known as Ray Johnson (1912-1984), a native of Laramie, Wyoming, was one of his state's pioneer aircraft pilots. Besides commercial flights, his career included the tasks of weather observation, crop dusting, air racing, and lookouts for forest fires. In 2013, he became posthumously the 22nd inductee into the Wyoming Aviation Hall of Fame in Cheyenne. During World War II, Johnson was a test pilot on the North American P-51 Mustang and North American B-25 Mitchell for North American Aviation in Kansas City, Missouri. Afterwards, he worked at airports in Mitchell, Nebraska; Huron, South Dakota, and Great Falls, Montana. Johnson also flew for such companies as Rocky Mountain Airways and Plains Airways. He was operations manager of the United States Army Air Corps training program at Cheyenne, Laramie, and Fort Morgan in northeastern Colorado. Johnson was certified by the former Civil Aeronautics Authority to conduct flight training at the University of Wyoming in Laramie and at Lambert Field in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1951, Johnson became flight instructor and later flight commander at Columbus Air Force Base in Columbus, Mississippi, where he was responsible for training pilots during the Korean War. He was one of the first flight instructors at the time of the formation in 1947 of the United States Air Force. Pilots entering the Korean War were trained at a time when planes were switched from piston engines to jet aircraft. In 1960, Johnson returned to Cheyenne to become the safety and enforcement officer of the Wyoming Aeronautics Commission, the same body that more than a half-century later approved his nomination to the Hall of Fame. He was also the pilot for Governors Jack R. Gage and Clifford Hansen. The Wyoming Aviation Hall of Fame was established in 1994. Only one aviator can be inducted into the Hall of Fame each year. John Waggener, president of the Hall of Fame, said that the limit of one inductee per year is designed to make the award more meaningful. Johnson’s name was originally submitted by a former coworker shortly after the Hall of Fame opened. His folder was rediscovered nearly twenty years later. Waggener said that Johnson, who died in 1984, saw the development of aviation from a mere novelty into a global industry. He describes Johnson's legacy, accordingly: Ray lived in the golden age of aviation. He not only witnessed it, he was part of it. But he’ll probably be one of the last of this World War II era. We’re starting to see a whole new range of pilots that include Vietnam pilots, big commercial pilots during the jet age, so we're going to see some different types of nominations [for the Hall of Fame] here in the next few years. Plaques honoring the Wyoming aviators are displayed at the terminal of the Cheyenne Regional Airport."

The aims of Dr. Dana’s research program are to (1) unravel the molecular and cellular processes that are responsible for initiating and sustaining immuno-inflammatory responses in the eye, and thereby (2) develop specific molecular targeting strategies to promote mechanisms that engender immune unresponsiveness without placing the eye or the patient at risk of toxicity or secondary infections. Areas of investigation include transplantation, angiogenesis, allergy, stem cells, and dry eye disease. Dr. Dana’s research is supported by several federal grants. Mentoring: In addition to research, Dr. Dana has focused on education of trainees, both clinical and research. This has included teaching of postdoctoral research fellows, clinical fellows and residents, and medical students and graduate students enrolled in various Harvard Medical School curricula. Overall, he has served as primary mentor to over 90 trainees in ophthalmology and eye research. In addition, as a strong believer in the importance of clinical scientists in bridging the wide gap between basic science and clinical applications, Dr. Dana directs the Harvard-Vision Clinical Scientist Development Program funded by the NIH K12 mechanism- with the express intent of recruiting, training, and retaining the brightest young minds to Harvard to contribute to research efforts. He has served as PI/Director for this program since its inception at Harvard Ophthalmology in 2004. In 2014, he received the A. Clifford Barger Excellence in Mentoring Award at Harvard Medical School. Research Focus: Dr. Dana is an ophthalmologist and immunologist whose principal research interest is in determining the molecular and cellular regulation of ocular immunity. The aims of his research program are to (1) unravel the molecular and cellular processes that are responsible for initiating and sustaining immuno-inflammatory responses in the cornea and anterior segment, and thereby (2) develop specific molecular targeting strategies to promote mechanisms that engender immune unresponsiveness without placing the eye or the patient at risk of toxicity or secondary infections. Areas of investigation include transplantation, angiogenesis (blood vessel development), stem cells, and dry eye disease. In addition, Dr. Dana has active collaborations in the field of bioengineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for applications in surgical adhesives, drug delivery and ocular prostheses. Dr. Dana’s research is supported by several federal grants among others. Mass Eye and Ear physician profile"

At the time, Ackroyd posed as a hacker named \"Kayla\" and was responsible for the penetration of multiple military and government domains and many high profile intrusions into thenetworks of Gawker in December 2010, HBGaryFederal in 2011, PBS, Sony, Infragard Atlanta, Fox Entertainment and others. After his release from jail, Ackroyd publicly stated during \"a conversation with Lulzsec\" that he believes Anonymous, other activists and like-minded should come together and attempt to change issues legally. In December 2014 he gave his first ever lecture in an over-capacity lecture auditorium at Sheffield Hallam University for over 200 students, where he spoke about Lulzsec and their \"50 days of lulz\". On his Twitter account Ackroyd vowed to help the security of the systems he once breached, stating that he would \"help secure and defend the systems in hopes we can all learn from each other, should I be given the chance to do so\". He also added \"For me, it wasn't about stealing people's information, I just wanted to show people how flawed their so-called secure systems are. People need to fix their stuff… I sent countless emails to companies and even government organisations and I was ignored. I soon realised I'd have to show them why they should secure themselves before they would listen. I'm like Jiminy Cricket, only when you don't listen I'd hit you really hard with my tiny umbrella so you'd do the right thing,\" he joked."

  "text" : "Robert Dalzell, 1st Earl of Carnwath, PC (1611 – 21 June 1654), known as Robert Dalzell, 2nd Lord Dalzell from 1636 to 1639, was a Scottish nobleman and Royalist supporter during the English Civil War. He married, firstly, Christian Douglas, daughter of Sir William Douglas and secondly, Katherine Arington, daughter of John Arington. He had succeeded his father as the second Lord Dalzell in 1636, and was made a Privy Counsellor of Scotland in June 1638. He was further elevated within the Peerage on 21 April 1639 when he was created Earl of Carnwath and Lord Dalzell and Liberton in the Peerage of Scotland by King Charles I, with a remainder to heirs male whatsoever bearing the Name and Arms of Dalzell. Lord Carnwath was accused by the Convention of the Scottish Estate of betraying them to the King in 1643. He was fined £10,000 and his titles were forfeited and he was sentenced to death by an Act of the Scottish Parliament on 25 Feb 1645. This Act also provided \"that his lawful son Gavin, Lord Dalzell, shall enjoy not only all the estates but the title of Earl as if his father were dead\". From this time his son, Gavin Dalzell was known in Scotland as the second Earl of Carnwath, however he was still referred to as the Earl of Carnwath in Royalist circles. His death sentence was not to be carried out. He went on to fight with King Charles I at the battle of Naseby on 14 June 1645, where he received some blame for the loss of the battle. King Charles, attempting to rally his men, rode forward but as he did so, Lord Carnwath seized his bridle and pulled him back, fearing for the King's safety. Carnwath's action was misinterpreted by the royalist soldiers as a signal to move back, leading to a collapse of their position. The military balance then tipped decisively in favour of Parliament. Lord Carnwath was taken prisoner after the Battle of Worcester 1651, and committed to the Tower of London for a time. He later died on 21 June 1654."

He married, firstly, Jane Parkes, daughter of Samuel Parkes, on 23 September 1789. They had one daughter, Elizabeth Dalzell (1790−1801). He married, secondly, Andulusia Browne, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Browne, on 26 April 1794. They had the following children together: \n* Lady Emma Maria Dalzell (died 25 December 1882) \n* Lady Eleanor Jane Elizabeth Dalzell (died 4 May 1835) \n* Lady Charlotte Augusta Dalzell (died 27 December 1844) \n* Robert Arthur Dalzell (1 May 1796 - 30 December 1799) \n* Thomas Henry Dalzell, 7th Earl of Carnwath (2 September 1797 − 14 December 1867) \n* General Arthur Alexander Dalzell, 9th Earl of Carnwath (15 September 1799 − 28 April 1875) \n* Colonel Harry Burrard Dalzell, 10th Earl of Carnwath (11 November 1804 − 1 November 1887) \n* Colonel the Honourable Robert Alexander George Dalzell (19 August 1816 − 19 October 1878) (himself the father of the eleventh and thirteenth Earls of Carnwath) He married finally, Jane Carnell, daughter of John Carnell, on 11 October 1838. The titles of Earl of Carnwath, Lord Dalzell and Liberton and the Dalzell baronetcy of Glenae had been forfeited by a Writ of Attainder for treason for the fifth Earl's support of the Jacobite cause in an unsuccessful rebellion in 1715 known as the Fifteen or Lord Mar's Revolt. Lieutenant-General Dalzell was to have the attainder reversed by Act of Parliament on 26 May 1826, thereby having his grandfather's titles restored to him. Lord Carnwath died on 1 January 1839 aged 70, and was succeeded in his titles by his son, Thomas Dalzell."

The Maryland State Senate recognized his \"exemplary leadership\" of Mount St. Mary's when he retired. The first layman to hold the position at St. Bonaventure, he oversaw the university as it implemented a new core curriculum and expanded its University of Ministries, among other achievements before resigning his position during a scandal over the acceptance of an ineligible basketball player. An avid collector of the works of 17th century poet John Milton for decades, Wickenheiser sold his collection to the University of South Carolina in 2006, helping it establish what was declared at that time to be among the largest collections of Milton in the world."

He is currently the UKIP leader in Norfolk County Council. His surname is pronounced \"Cook\". Born in 1954 at Weasenham, near Great Massingham in Norfolk, Coke is the elder son of Major Richard Lovel Coke (1918–2001), by his marriage to Molly, a daughter of Walter Townshend Fletcher. His father was a grandson of Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester (1822–1909). He was educated at Radley College and Sandhurst and commissioned into the Scots Guards. After four years in the army, he followed a financial services career in the City of London, before going to work in Canada and the United States. He returned to Norfolk to run the family estate, which consists largely of woodland, and now operates a training course at the Weasenham estate called \"Extreeme Adventure.\" A climate change sceptic, Coke has said he is \"fundamentally opposed to the climate change scam which is causing fuel poverty and the monstrous wind turbines that threaten so much of our most picturesque countryside.\" At the Norfolk County Council election on 2 May 2013, Coke was elected to represent the Gayton and Nar Valley electoral division and a few days later was chosen as leader of the county council's UKIP group of fifteen councillors, making him leader of the opposition\". Coke unsuccessfully contested Mid Norfolk for UKIP in 2010 and North West Norfolk for UKIP in 2015. He commented that before 2010 he had no involvement in politics apart from \"dabbling in parish politics\"."

He is known as the author or co-author of several mathematical textbooks. Beals studied at Yale University earning a B.A. in 1960, an M.A. in 1962, and a Ph.D. in 1964 under Felix Browder with thesis Non-Local Boundary Value Problems for Elliptic Partial Differential Operators. In the academic year 1965/1966 he was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Chicago, where he became in 1966 an assistant professor and later a professor. In 1977 he became a professor at Yale University. Beals works on inverse problems in scattering theory, integrable systems, pseudodifferential operators, complex analysis, global analysis and transport theory. He has been married since 1962 and has three children. He should not be confused with the mathematics professor at Rutgers University named R. Michael Beals (born in 1954), who is Richard Beals's brother."

She is best known for her 1918 novel Despised and Rejected (written under the pen name A T Fitzroy), which was banned under the Defence of the Realm Act as it combines themes of pacifism and homosexuality which were thought \"likely to prejudice the recruiting of persons to serve on His Majesty's Forces\". Despised and Rejected was published by C. W. Daniel and was taken up by the Bloomsbury Group. The novel draws a connection between the persecution of homosexuals and the rhetoric of imperialism. It tells the story of a homosexual composer who is conscripted for military service; his refusal leads to trial and imprisonment."

He was born in Liverpool and in 1963 moved with his family to Birkenhead. In 1968 he joined the British Army, where he served for 18 years as a military engineer. During the late 1980s he worked in Darfur and Afghanistan, advising non-governmental organisations and establishing landmine clearance operations. He founded the Mines Advisory Group in 1989, after seeing the impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) on civilians in Afghanistan, and became an internationally acknowledged expert on the impact of landmines and cluster munitions on relief and humanitarian efforts in the Balkans, Africa, and Asia. He is currently the Mercy Corps' Senior Director Migration Response since February 2016, after nearly three years as Country Director for North Syria and Turkey, also for Mercy Corps. In 1992 he co-founded the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, an international coalition of organisations opposed to the deployment of landmines, and persuaded Princess Diana to give her active support to the campaign in 1997. The organisation won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997, and McGrath presented the acceptance speech on behalf of the ICBL in Oslo. He has also organised programmes responding to natural emergencies, such as the 2004 tsunami in Aceh as well as emergencies in Ethiopia and Somaila. He worked as Senior Programme Manager for emergency response with Save the Children UK from 2007 until 2012 and is now the Senior Director Migration Response Mercy Corps based in Turkey, Greece and the Balkans. He lectures on conflict and humanitarian issues, and is an Associate at the Post War Reconstruction & Development Unit (PRDU) at the University of York. In 2014 McGrath was awarded an Honorary Degree by the University of York"

  "text" : "Richard Bellings or Bellyngs (died 1584) was an Irish barrister and landowner who was Solicitor General for Ireland from 1574 to 1584. His grandson and namesake Richard Bellings was a leading figure in Confederate Ireland. He was probably born in Mulhuddart, County Dublin, a district with which his family had a long association. He was called to the Bar, quickly became one of its leaders, and was appointed Solicitor General in 1574. He seems to have been diligent in performing his duties, attending the Court of Castle Chamber and sitting on several commissions of oyer and terminer. Presumably as a reward for his services, the Crown made substantial grants of land to him in County Dublin, including Tyrrelstown, which became the principal family seat. Despite his record of good service and his apparent legal ability, he never became a judge; this may reflect the personal disfavour of Queen Elizabeth I, who thought poorly of her Irish law officers, especially those who were Irish by birth. Her remedy for the perceived \"default and inefficiency of her officers of the law\" in Ireland, whenever vacancies arose was to replace Irish office holders with Englishmen. Elrington Ball, normally a very reliable source for the Irish judiciary, and for history of Dublin generally, states that Bellings was still alive in 1600, but the letters patent appointing his successor as Solicitor General, Jesse Smythes, in January 1585, state clearly that he had recently died. Given the Queen's attitude to her Irish law officers it is not surprising that Smythes was English. Richard's son Sir Henry Bellings became Provost Marshal and High Sheriff of Kildare; despite a reputation for corruption, (including the notorious case of Philip Bushen, who was hanged in1625 for the murder of his wife, a crime which most likely he did not commit), and several clashes with the Crown, he had a largely successful career and extended the family estates. Henry was the father of the second Richard, the Confederate leader, and grandfather of the third Richard Bellings, secretary to Queen Catherine of Braganza."

Briggs is responsible for several innovations in digital marketing. In 1995, Briggs joined Wired, as Director of Research, focusing on their digital brand HotWired. He created the first study of Web banner advertising effectiveness. The research is notable because it was the first application of random sampling online, and used design of experiments to measure the in-market impact of online advertising. Briggs and his team at HotWired innovated one-to-one web marketing to deliver personalized content, and real-time web analytics, known as “HotStats”."

  "text" : "Roland (Royal Jr.) W. Reed (June 22, 1864 – December 14, 1934), an American artist and photographer, was part of an early 20th century group of photographers of Native Americans known as pictorialists. Pictorialists were influenced by the late 19th Century art movement, Impressionism, and their photography was characterized by an emphasis on lighting and focus. Rather than record an image as it was, pictorialists were more interested in re-creating an image as they thought it might have been. Part artist and part scientist, they endeavored to have their re-creations reflect not only the highest artistic value, but unquestioned ethnological accuracy as well. At the beginning of the 20th century a number of pictorialists, noticing the extremely deleterious impact of reservation life on Native Americans, wanted to recreate in photographs the Indian's life and ways as they had been in better times, rather than record how it had actually become."

  "text" : "Richard Abbot (1818 – 15 July 1904) was an English poet. He was born in Burton-in-Kendal, Westmorland (now Cumbria). His father worked as a subcontractor on the Lancaster and Kendal Canal, which was then being extended to Tewitfield. His mother died when he was three years old. Abbot's initial education, from the age of four, was undertaken at Dame schools in Shap Fell and Galgate, Lancashire, before he studied at a National school in Ingleton, North Yorkshire. When the family was in Ingleton, Abbot's father began farming on the fells of Ingleborough, and from the age of 11, Abbot assisted him as a shepherd. Around 5 years later, his father suffered a serious accident that affected his sight and brain function, forcing him to end his farming business. Abbot gained new employment as a labourer on the construction of railways in Scotland, and parts of northern England. At the age of 50, he became the manager of a limestone quarry in the parish of Forcett, North Yorkshire. He continued in this position for 32 years. After retiring, he passed the quarry to his son. He also had two daughters. He died at his home in Forcett in 1904, at the age of 86. He is buried in the graveyard of St Cuthbert's Church in Forcett. Four collections of his poetry were published between 1868 and 1901. In 1884, he became a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. His 1879 collection The pen, the press, and the sword features a lithograph portrait by Ralph Hedley, and another portrait is included in his 1901 collection The Wanderer. His poetry was also printed in magazines in England and colonial territories. They often appeared in the Teesdale Mercury. Three of his poems appeared in North Country Poets: \"The Song of Ingleton Bells\", \"O, Turn Aside Thy Loving Eyes\" and \"Fading Beauty\"."

He was decorated with 3 bronze stars and a purple heart. He entered the NYPD in 1958 as a patrolman and was quickly promoted to detective. He worked undercover investigating members of the Black Liberation Army. At one point, the BLA placed a $50,000 bounty on his head, which is believed to still exist today. From 1973-1976, he led the Cardillo murder investigation. He was forced to retire from the NYPD, pleading Nolo contendere to a series of charges brought up on by the NYPD. While still a detective for the NYPD, he began working on films as a consultant. He transitioned to a career in film acting and production and has appeared in more than 30 films. His son Devon was once involved in an incident where an Asian fellow, named Fuki Wang, threw a chair from the 20th story of a building in Pittsburgh and it landed on Devon's future wife's car causing significant damage."

An early collaborative work produced by Bond and O'Donoghue was the University of Sydney student theatre revue \"The Great Wall of Porridge\" in 1967. It was a profitable success and was performed in a theatre off the University campus, with the funds reportedly paying for a parquetry floor in the Sydney University architecture students' common room. Bond and O'Donoghue wrote the music for a pantomime \"Hamlet on Ice\", which premiered at the Nimrod Theatre. Its 1975 revival was described as \"a jest at Shakespeare's Hamlet and Australian manhood among other things\". Bond and O'Donoghue won an Australian Film Institute award in 1981 for best movie score for the music for the film Fatty Finn. O'Donoghue has also written music for advertisements."

He was hanged by the British on 28 December 1857 for taking part in the revolt and being found guilty of the killing of British soldiers. In 1992, the Government of India built a memorial at the place where he was hanged to honor his death. The dilapidated remains of his fort - consisting of the ruins of his royal mansion, a huge campus spread over hundreds of acres, a temple to Shiva which has been in use for more than 180 years, and various other structures - have been in the news recently due to an excavation for gold by the Archaeological Survey of India.  The Archaeological Survey of India, upon excavation his fort in October 2013, discovered a brick wall, sherds, pieces of bangles, hopscotch toys, and a mud floor which could date back to the 17-19th centuries, but no gold treasure or any other valuable materials."

  "text" : "Raymond Harland Hayes (13 July 1909 - 16 May 2000) was a British archaeologist. He wrote and published extensively about archaeology, primarily in the North York Moors area. Hayes was born in York. His father was a professional photographer who owned a studio in Monkgate. While Raymond was still an infant, his family moved to Beck Garth, in the village of Hutton-le-Hole on the North York Moors. His father's business continued to prosper here. The studio mostly produced illustrations for books on the history and topography of North Riding. Upon graduating from a local school, Hayes began to serve as an apprentice to his father. He soon developed an interest in archaeology. Hayes had attended numerous lectures on archaeology delivered by some famous scholars, Philip Corder being a standout name among them. This was the major reason behind the young Hayes' inclination toward archaeology. His interest was complimented by a gift for photography, two qualities that won him admirers and employers on local digs. Hayes's knowledge of the north York moors made him a sought after archaeologist. He worked with several renowned archaeologists, including Geoffrey Dimbleby. It was Hayes who took Dimbleby to sites on which the latter conducted his pioneering analysis of pollen. The photography skills of Hayes led to his being part of many excavations from the mid-1930s. In 1947, he photographed the town-house site in Malton. In 1958, he took photographs of the excavation site at the Roman town of Cataractonium (Catterick). His photos of the town are the only surviving record of that excavation. Hayes was rewarded with the MBE for his services to archaeology."

Jones was born in Ferndale in the Rhondda Valley of Wales. The son of a coal miner, he initially worked in the mines himself before studying piano and voice at the Royal Academy of Music. His studies were interrupted by World War II when he served in the Royal Navy. After the war in Europe ended, he was engaged by Sadlers Wells where on 7 June 1945 he made his operatic debut as Balstrode in the world premiere of Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes. He joined the Welsh National Opera in 1951 and remained with the company for the rest of his career. Amongst his notable performances there were Montfort in I vespri siciliani and the title role in Nabucco. After his retirement from the stage in the early 1960s he became the Director of the Jamaica School of Music. He returned to Wales in 1970 and taught singing at Aberystwyth University College. Jones died in Newport, Wales at the age of 82."

  "text" : "Randolph H. Guthrie (1905 – 11 September 1989) was an American lawyer and businessman who became the chairman of the Studebaker corporation. Randolph H. Guthrie was born in Richmond, Virginia.He attended the The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, and then the Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude.In 1931 he joined the New York law form of Mudge, Rose.In 1958 Guthrie was a senior partner in Mudge, Steen, Baldwin and Todd, the legal counsel in the United States for Daimler Benz. In October that year he was elected to the board of Studebaker.When Richard Nixon lost his bid for election as governor of California in 1962, he joined the firm of Mudge, Rose, Guthrie and Alexander. Of the partners, he is said to have felt closest to Guthrie. John N. Mitchell was another partner in the law firm, to be appointed U.S. Attorney General by Nixon after he was elected president in 1968. By 1963 Studebaker's automobile division was in difficulty. Guthrie was elected chairman of the board.At the 8 August 1963 board meeting he recommended that the board start planning on the assumption that Studebaker was going to stop manufacturing cars.Studebaker merged with Worthington Corporation on 27 November 1967. Guthrie became chairman of Studebaker-Worthington.Guthrie was chairman of the board until 1971. From 1969 to 1977 Guthrie was chairman of the board of UMC Industries, which manufactured money-changing equipment.In June 1970 Guthrie was invited to represent Penn Central, then on the brink of bankruptcy and looking for government assistance. It was hoped that he could use his influence with Nixon. However John A. Volpe, Secretary of Transportation, insisted that the railroad dismiss Guthrie due to the political risk if the tie to Nixon became public. Guthrie became a senior partner of Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander & Ferdon.He died at home in Hilton Head, South Carolina of a heart attack on 11 September 1989, aged 83.His son, Randolph \"Bob\" Guthrie, became a plastic surgeon, and was one of the two inventors of the standard procedure for reconstructive breast surgery."

El-Sayed soon became Sweden's richest man, and made the fortune of his employees and shareholders. A charismatic leader, he was a favourite of the media, and in December 1985 he was named \"Swede of the year\" by the TV news program Rapport. The following month, Fermenta announced a partnership with Swedish industrial giant Volvo. El-Sayed was at the peak of his fame. The fall from grace was brutal: just one month later, El-Sayed was accused of lying about his academic qualifications, as he had falsely asserted he was a Doctor of Science. The partnership with Volvo was broken. In 1992, El-Sayed became the CEO of another biotech company, Hebi Health Care."

On 27 August 1846 he married Sarah Bushby Harris, daughter of Captain John Harris, RN, of Eldon House, Ontario, Canada. Together they had the following children: \n* Amelia Andalusia Dalzell (died 15 August 1850) \n* Robert Harris Carnwath Dalzell, 11th Earl of Carnwath (1 July 1847 - 8 March 1910) \n* Lady Mary Isabella Dalzell (1850 - 5 February 1936) \n* Arthur Edward Dalzell, 13th Earl of Carnwath (25 December 1851 - 9 March 1941) \n* Lady Charlotte Emma Maud Dalzell (born 1859), married 25 February 1882, Colonel Sir Lancelot Rolleston of Watnall Hall. Dalzell died on 19 October 1878 aged 62. If he had survived his elder brother, Harry Dalzell, 10th Earl of Carnwath, he would have himself succeeded as Earl of Carnwath, the title instead passing to his eldest son, Robert Dalzell. To recognise this, his other children were raised to the rank of children of an Earl by Royal Warrant of Precedence in 1889."

  "text" : "Roy Grantham CBE (12 December 1926 – 25 October 2013) was a United Kingdom trade union leader who was the last general secretary of the Association of Professional, Executive, Clerical and Computer Staff (APEX) which was involved in the Grunwick dispute in the 1970s. He was born in Birmingham and attended King Edward VI Grammar School, Aston before being conscripted to work in a coal mine as a Bevin Boy. He then worked for the Inland Revenue which he left to become a full-time union organizer for the Clerical and Administrative Workers Union in 1959. In 1963 he became the assistant secretary and in 1970 the general secretary. He was also member of the TUC General Council for 11 years. Grantham was considered a moderate leader and during a bitter dispute at the Grunwick film processing plant he faced criticism from other trade unionists for not asking other unions to cut off power and supplies, but he explained that it would be illegal to do so. He also expressed concern that picketing by other unions such at the Yorkshire miners led by Arthur Scargill would not help. Grantham then became the president of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions and the Labour government appointed him a director of Chrysler UK, but he resigned in 1981 when the company closed its Linwood plant in Scotland. In 1985 he was elected chairman of the TUC employment committee. He was pro-European and did not support nationalisation of the banks but supported nationalisation in other sectors."

  "text" : "Rift Fournier (1936 – October 6, 2013) was an American writer, screenwriter and television producer. Fournier, who lost the ability to walk at 17 years old due to polio, had a long and diverse career in television. He wrote episodes of numerous television series, including Baretta, Charlie's Angels, Highway to Heaven, Hell Town, Kojak, Matlock, and NYPD Blue. Fournier was born in 1936 in Wichita, Kansas, and raised in both Chicago and Omaha, Nebraska. His parents decided to call him \"Rift\" after a dispute over what they would name their son. Fournier was acting and screenwriting at the Omaha Community Playhouse by the time he was 13 years old. He attended a Jesuit school, where he excelled as an athlete. Fournier contracted polio during his Junior year in high school. On a Sunday morning in 1953, Fournier collapsed while getting out of bed to answer the telephone. He never regained his ability to walk and remained in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Rift Fournier never let his disability dissuade him from pursuing his career. In a 1986 interview with the Los Angeles Times, he said, \"I didn't know [polio] was supposed to stop me from doing something,...You've heard the joke. ‘I never knew I was poor.… ’ Well, I never knew I was handicapped.\" In 1963, Fournier began co-producing The Mike Douglas Show, which was created in Cleveland, Ohio, for syndication. He died in St. Louis, Missouri, on October 6, 2013, at the age of 77."

  "text" : "Sir Robert Wisdom, KCMG (31 January 1830 – 16 March 1888) was a politician in colonial New South Wales and Attorney General of New South Wales. Wisdom was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, England, and arrived in Australia in 1834 with his parents. He was educated at Maitland, N.S.W., and at the Sydney College, and was admitted to the Colonial Bar in 1861. He became the first member for Goldfields West in 1859, having resigned the office of Gold Commissioner, which he had previously held, to contest the seat. He represented this constituency in the Assembly in two parliaments, the Lower Hunter in two more, and was also member for the Goldfields North. For a short period he was Crown Prosecutor, and afterwards represented Morpeth. He was Chairman of Committees in the Assembly for nearly four years, and was appointed a member of the Council of Education 1878. He was Attorney-General in the Henry Parkes Government from August 1879 to January 1883. In 1887 he came to England with Sir Patrick Jennings as one of the delegates of New South Wales, to the Colonial Conference held in that year, and was created K.C.M.G. during the sittings. Returning to New South Wales, Sir Robert died on 16 March 1888."

Born in England, Uther began his career in seal skins before emigrating to Sydney in 1807 where he founded a hat making industry, a region of industry that he subsequently monopolised. He was a signatory to the petition to Major George Johnston calling for the deposing of the Governor of New South Wales, William Bligh, having only lived in the country for one year. Awarded a 400 acre ground by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1812 during the fallout from the Rum Rebellion, Uther expanded his interests to include agriculture - specifically meat production. Admired for his innovative farming techniques in Australia, Uther unsuccessfully petitioned the British Colonial Office during a visit back to England for the government to bequeath him more land upon which to farm. He married in 1812, though he was widowed in 1829 when his wife accidentally drowned. He expanded his industrial interests to include that of ironmongery and mining, and married a second time. Upon his death in 1880 his estate valued at 250,000 Pounds Sterling."

  "text" : "Richard Cox (c. 1766 – 20 May 1845) was an English brewer and horticulturist who bred the apple varieties Cox's Orange Pippin and Cox's Pomona. Cox operated the Black Eagle Brewery located at 27 White's Grounds, Bermondsey, London until 1820, when he retired with his wife Ann to The Lawns (later Colnbrook Lawn) in Colnbrook, Slough, Buckinghamshire (now Berkshire), England, to pursue his hobby of horticulture. The house sat on two acres of land in the vicinity of Rodney Way and Daventry Close on the north side of the old Bath Road (now the High Street), about a mile west of the modern-day boundary of Heathrow Airport. In 1830 he planted pips from a Ribston Pippin apple grown in his orchard, crossed with Blenheim Orange. Satisfied with the quality of the fruit produced by two of his seedlings, in 1836 he supplied grafts to E. Small & Son, the local nurseryman who offered the first trees for sale in 1840. The two varieties, Cox's Orange Pippin and Cox's Pomona, remained mostly unknown until Charles Turner of the Royal Nurseries in Slough, impressed by their quality, began to offer them in his catalog in 1850. Other English nurserymen began to graft and sell Cox's Orange Pippin trees, and by 1883 it was one of the most popular apples in the country. Cox died in 1845 without seeing the success of the apple varieties to which he gave his name. By 2007, Cox's Orange Pippin, grown worldwide, was Britain's most popular apple, accounting for over 50% of UK orchard acreage, and 48% of sales. Ownership of the brewery passed to Noakes & Company after Cox's death and would continue operation under different owners, ultimately Courage, until 1930.The original Cox's Orange Pippin tree in Colnbrook was blown down in a storm in 1911, but two trees, grafted from the original, were still standing in the orchard as of 1933. The site is currently occupied by a block of low-rise flats also called The Lawns. Richard Cox outlived his wife by eight years and died in 1845, aged 79; both are buried in the churchyard at St.Mary's in Harmondsworth. A memorial orchard stands near the site of The Lawns in Colnbrook, consisting of Cox's Orange Pippin, Cox's Pomona, Ribston Pippin, and Blenheim Orange with metallic benches in the shapes of the letters C, O and X."
