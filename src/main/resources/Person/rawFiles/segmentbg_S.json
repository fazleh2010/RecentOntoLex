Miller submitted his resignation on May 15, 2013, in the wake of the 2013 IRS scandal in which the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released an audit report confirming that the IRS used inappropriate criteria to identify potential political cases, including organizations with Tea Party in their names for closer scrutiny on 501(c)(4) applications.

  "text" : "Solicito \"Mike\" Salvador, originally Salvadore Sollecito (1869–1924), was a leader and innovator in the Florida shrimping industry in Fernandina Beach, Florida. He is listed as a Great Floridian. Born in 1869, Sollecito Salvatore came from Syracuse, Sicily, as a merchant seaman aboard an Italian freighter forced by a hurricane to lay over at the Port of Fernandina in Fernandina, Florida. Salvador came to New Orleans in 1895 on a banana boat. He traveled to Cedar Key and then Fernandina in 1898 by train. He first worked as an interpreter, fishing part-time. Then he got into shrimping. He experimented with preservatives so shrimp could be shipped and tried canning. He used large shrimp shipments to secure refrigerated car lots and used haul seines to increase catch size. As others copied his innovations, the local industry expanded and corollary businesses such as boat building prospered. He used modified otter trawl nets to greatly expand the catch and make use of deeper waters. He and his brother-in-law, Salvatore Versaggi, expanded operations to St. Augustine, Florida. Salvador founded the Salvador Fish Company in 1906 and by 1921 was shipping across the U.S. and internationally to countries including Canada and Denmark. He died in 1924. A blue plaque commemorating Salvador is located at the site of his family residence at 20 South 4th Street in Fernandina Beach."

Simon was one of few bishops that supported King Philip IV \"the fair\" of France against Pope Boniface VIII (c. 1235-1303), to strengthen the monarchy and make the Church support the state's finances in the time of war, while the Pope demanded the privilege of exemption from tax, in spite of extreme wealth, and proclaimed that the Pope is above every king in authority, but the king engaged the best available lawyers for his case. The conflict led in 1309 to the moving of the Papal court, under Pope Clement V (c. 1264-1314), to Avignon, outside the king's realm."

  "text" : "Sigard Adolphus Knopf (November 27, 1857 – July 15, 1940) was a German-born American physician. Born Siegmund Knopf on November 27, 1857, he received his early education at the Higher Municipal School in Halle-on-the-Saale before moving to the United States in 1880. After being an instructor in non-English languages in the Los Angeles area he matriculated to the University of Southern California, where he studied during 1884–86. In 1888 he graduated with an M.D. from Bellevue Hospital Medical School, then practiced medicine in Los Angeles for two years. He was married to Perle Nora Dyar in 1889; the couple would have no children. Leaving for France to study at the University of Paris, he received an A.B. and B.S. from the institution in 1891. For the next four years he worked at hospitals in Paris while studying at the University of France, where he received his second M.D. in 1895. Following his work at a Paris hospital for tuberculosis patients, he returned to the United States in 1896 where he became a specialist in the treatment of the disease. In 1898, his book titled Pulmonary tuberculosis; its modern prophylaxis and the treatment in special institutions and at home was awarded the Alvarenga prize by the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. His 1900 book Tuberculosis as a disease of the masses and how to combat it was awarded the international prize by the International Congress to Combat Tuberculosis as a Disease of the Masses. This work led to the formation of the Committee for the Prevention of Tuberculosis by New York health professionals and the local business and social elite. In 1904, he helped found the National Tuberculosis Association, since renamed the American Lung Association. A proponent of eugenics, in 1914 he helped organize the First National Conference for Race Betterment. He called tuberculosis patients that bore children 'criminals' and was in favor of mandatory sterilization for patients that \"procreated willfully\". During World War I, he was given the rank of captain in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and helped to establish procedures for the prevention of pneumonia and tuberculosis. During his career he published over 400 works. He favored rehabilitation of prostitutes and was a proponent for the establishment of birth-control clinics in order to counter the poverty and health issues associated with large families. Knopf was a member of the Committee of One Hundred that lobbied for the formation of a national department of health. A collection of his papers is held at the National Library of Medicine."

An Arab from Palestine, Sa'id ibn Yazid was appointed by Caliph Yazid I to succeed Maslama ibn Mukhallad al-Ansari as governor of Egypt after the latter's death in early 682. Although he tried to present an image of continuity by keeping Maslama's sahib al-shurta (head of security and de facto deputy), 'Abis ibn Sa'id al-Muradi, the local Arab settler community (wujuh) were opposed to him as an outsider. In 683, the Second Islamic Civil War broke out, and soon after Yazid I's death in November, Ibn al-Zubayr was acknowledged as Caliph at Mecca. Ibn al-Zubayr gained the support of the Kharijites in Egypt and sent a governor of his own, Abd al-Rahman ibn Utba al-Fihri, to the province. Sa'id ibn Yazid chose not to offer resistance and simply retired. The Kharijite-supported Zubayrid regime was even more unpopular with the wujuh, and lasted for less than a year before the wujuh leaders called upon the Umayyad Caliph Marwan I for aid, who reconquered the province in December 684."

  "text" : "Stan Vincent (born Stanley Grochowski, 1944) is an American record producer/arranger best known for the Top Ten hits \"I'm Gonna Make You Mine\" by Lou Christie and \"O-o-h Child\" by Five Stairsteps. He is also a composer notably having written \"O-o-h Child\" and several songs recorded by Connie Francis. Stan Vincent also assisted in the making of the 1980 Double Fantasy album by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. A child actor under his birth name of Stanley Crochowski, playing Jimmy on the Chicago-based NBC-TV Saturday morning educational series Watch Mr. Wizard, Stan Vincent began his music industry career as a teenager working as a gofer at the Brooklyn-based offices of Jim Gribble who managed several doo-wop groups including the Mystics and the Passions, sometimes assisting on the recordings on Gribble's clients: by 1959 Vincent was himself recording his output including two singles backed by the Del Satins. Vincent's releases were overlooked but a recording he produced for the Del Satins of his composition \"Teardrops Follow Me\" became a regional success in the summer of 1962 and Vincent was afforded his first major success as the producer of the Earls hit \"Remember Then\" recorded in 1962 which reached #24 in January 1963. Vincent had several songs recorded by Connie Francis, notably her hit singles \"Drownin' My Sorrows\" (1963) and \"Looking For Love\" (1964), the latter being the title song for a cinematic vehicle for Francis - see Looking for Love - in which she sang two other Vincent compositions: \"Let's Have a Party\" and \"When the Clock Strikes Midnight\". Francis also recorded the Stan Vincent compositions \"Lollipop Lips\", \"Whatever Happened to Rosemarie\" and \"Tommy\" to serve as the B-sides to her hits \"If My Pillow Could Talk\" (1962)\"Your Other Love\" (1963), and \"Be Anything (but Be Mine)\" (1963). The compositions which Vincent placed with Francis were all co-written with Hank Hunter. By 1968 Vincent was working for Buddah Records as an in-house producer/arranger and songwriter. In the autumn of 1969 Lou Christie hit #10 nationally with \"I'm Gonna Make You Mine\" produced and arranged by Vincent: the track was more successful in the UK reaching #2 there. In the summer of 1970 the Five Stairsteps hit #8 with \"O-o-h Child\" which Vincent not only produced and arranged but composed. Originally intended as the B-side of the 5 Stairsteps' version of \"Dear Prudence\", \"O-o-h Child\" has subsequently been remade by over twenty artists, with the 1993 remake - entitled \"Ooh Child\" - by Dino reaching #27. Vincent's subsequent collaborations with both Lou Christie and the 5 Stairsteps failed to become major US hits - although Christie's \"She Sold Me Magic\" reached #25 UK - and Vincent's collaborations with other Buddah artists such as the Brooklyn Bridge, the Edwin Hawkins Singers, the Ronettes, Sha Na Na, and Ronnie Dyson were also not major successes although Dyson's \"When You Get Right Down to It\" - a Barry Mann composition arranged and produced by Vincent - was a Top 40 UK hit (#34 in 1972). Vincent also produced the recording of \"Superstar\" by Cher for Atco Records which was issued as a promo single in November 1970 but never given a full release. In the summer of 1978 Vincent founded his own independent record label Voyage Records whose debut release was a remake produced by Vincent of \"I'm Gonna Make You Mine\" recorded by Larry Evoy: Voyage Records had no evident success. Vincent was the business manager for Jack Douglas at the time the latter produced the 1980 John Lennon/Yoko Ono album Double Fantasy: it was at Vincent's house in Montauk that Douglas listened to the demo Lennon had prepared in hopes of recruiting him as producer. Vincent oversaw the negotiations over Lennon and Ono working with Douglas, the negotiations being made with Ono, and also made the arrangements for booking studio time and hiring session personnel: it was Vincent who recommended guitarist Hugh McCracken and keyboardist George Small."

  "text" : "Samuel Crooke (1575-1649) was a seventeenth-century cleric of the Church of England and a noted preacher; during the English Civil War he was a staunch supporter of the Parliamentary cause. He was born at Great Waldingfield in Suffolk, second son of Thomas Crooke, rector of the parish and later reader at Gray's Inn; Samuel seems to have been a family name on his mother's side. His father was a prominent member of the \"godly elite\", whose Calvinist views caused the Church authorities to regard him with some suspicion, although his position at Gray's Inn protected him from any serious harm. Samuel clearly inherited his father's religious views. Two of his brothers achieved fame: Sir Thomas Crooke, 1st Baronet, as founder of Baltimore, County Cork, and Helkiah Crooke as royal physician and author of one of the first textbooks on anatomy. Samuel's brother-in-law, Stephen Egerton, was another leading Puritan preacher. Samuel went to the Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood; he entered the University of Cambridge as a scholar of Pembroke Hall, and was elected a fellow, but the election was disallowed. Soon afterwards he became a fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He was appointed reader in the public schools, and in accordance with college statutes took holy orders in 1601. He was a fine linguist, who could speak French, Italian and Spanish and read Hebrew and Arabic. In 1602 he was presented to the living of Wrington, Somerset: he was a fine preacher, and was said to be the first clergyman in the locality who brought \"credit to religion\". He married Judith Walsh but had no children. Little is recorded of him in middle life except that he educated the children of his brother Sir Thomas, and that Sir Thomas in his will of 1629 left legacies to Samuel and his wife. He is said to have caused controversy by his refusal to wear a surplice, upon which the dominant High Court faction in the hierarchy, led by William Laud insisted, but which Samuel, like most radical Puritans, regarded as a symbol of Roman Catholicism. His sister Sarah, widow of Stephen Egerton, who died in 1624, left him her wedding ring as a legacy. He emerged from obscurity during the Civil War to become a champion of Parliament's cause. In 1642 when the House of Commons voted to set up an assembly of clergymen to reform the Church, Samuel was chosen as one of the representatives for Somerset, but never actually took his seat in the assembly. In 1643 when King Charles I took control of Somerset, Samuel was considered influential enough to be singled out as a man whose recantation would be valuable. He was persuaded, presumably under some pressure, to sign articles expressing his abhorrence for any alteration to the Established Church. His recantation was greeted with joy by Royalists and fury by reformers, but was almost certainly not sincere, since he returned to the cause of reformation as soon as it was politically safe to do so. In 1648 when a scheme for \"Presbyterian Government\" for Somerset was drawn up Samuel was appointed a superintendent for the Wrington district. He died at the end of 1649, aged almost 75: his funeral is said to have drawn a great crowd from all classes of life. He wrote a number of tracts and Latin verses."

  "text" : "Sophie Christina Mathilda Bolander (1807 in Gothenburg – 1869 in Gothenburg), was a Swedish author. She is most famed for her participation in the contemporary debate in gender issues. Sophie Bolander was the daughter of the factory owner Gustav Erik Bolander and Johanna Kristina Carlström. She never married. Her anti-aristocratic novel »Trolldomstecknet» has been regarded as one of the first tendency novels in Sweden. During the 1850s, many of her novels was published as serials in papers such as Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning, [[Post- och Inrikes Tidningar]] and Aftonbladet. Her novels were romance stories, often in historical setting. Bolander is mostly known for her participation in the contemporary gender debate. Her writings focused on marriage and motherhood as the one and only true goal for a woman. She supported Fredrika Bremer in the critique of the shallow education of accomplishments for girls, and the reformist's demands that it should be replaced with serious education more equal with the one give to boys. However, in contrast to Bremer and the other reformists, Bolander did not support the idea that women should be given serious education to prepare them for an emancipated life as independent professionals, but rather that they should be given a serious academic education because this would make them better wives and mothers. Fredrika Bremer remarked about this, that Sophie Bolander was only prepared to meet her halfway. However, Bolander was, in this aspect, supporting a common view among contemporary moderate reformists. Her novel Qvinnan med förmyndare (Woman with Guardian) was a conservative response to the novel Qvinnan utan förmyndare (Woman without Guardian) by Amelie von Strussenfelt, which was a part of the contemporary debate about the minority of adult unmarried women, which were legally under the guardianship of their closest male relative."

  "text" : "Salvatore Mannuzzu (born 1930) is an Italian writer, politician and magistrate. Mannuzzu was born in Pitigliano. He was a magistrate until 1976 and a member of the Italian Parliament until 1987. He is considered, with Giulio Angioni and Sergio Atzeni, one of the initiators of the so-called Sardinian Literary Nouvelle Vague, or Sardinian Literary Spring, the Sardinian narrative of today in the European arena, which followed the work of individual prominent figures such as Grazia Deledda, Emilio Lussu, Giuseppe Dessì, Gavino Ledda, Salvatore Satta. Mannuzzu's most successful novel is Procedura (1988. Einaudi), winner of Italy's Viareggio's Prize in 1989. It is a detective story where the nameless narrator is an investigative judge who has to discover Valerio Garau's killer. Garau is an attorney from Sassari in Sardinia, who is poisoned to death while having coffee with his lover. The story unfolds in two years, 1978 and 1979, during a critical period for Italy, marked by a wave of terrorism. In 2000 the director Antonello Grimaldi has made the film Un delitto impossibile from this novel, which is also considered (with the coeval L'oro di Fraus by Giulio Angioni), the origin of a genre of Sardinian detective stories (giallo sardo)."

In 2010 he curated Fourteen Interventions, a multi-disciplinary site responsive exhibition at Swedenborg house, which included work by Jeremy Deller, Bridget Smith, Iain Sinclair, Ben Judd and Olivia Plender. His long-standing interest in the work of Emanuel Swedenborg informs much of his recent work and he has published on writers as diverse as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Arthur Cravan. In 2011 he set up the Swedenborg Archive imprint, a collaborative project which has included contributions from the writers Iain Sinclair and Brian Catling, and the publisher Book Works. As series editor of the Journal of the Swedenborg Society he has produced a number of volumes exploring the cultural influence of Swedenborg including Between Method and Madness, The Arms of Morpheus, In Search of the Absolute and On the True Philosopher. Notable contributors to the Journal include the poet Czeslaw Milosz and the Cambridge linguist John Chadwick. Annalisa Volpone has described the Journal as a 'mapping of the impact of Swedenborg's thought on the western literary imaginaire from romanticism to contemporary times'. McNeilly is a founding editor of Dedecus Press, an interdisciplinary and collaborative publishing project, and is the overseeing editor for the Dedecus Dictionary and the Dedecus Picture Archive. Between 2004 and 2012 he was a visiting lecturer in Art, Philosophy and Critical Theory at the University of Creative Arts (Canterbury)."

Known in the political and interreligious scenes by his wisdom and tolerance environment, he left many disciples including his own son, Soheib Bencheikh, the researcher in theology and former Mufti of Marseille, and Ghaleb Bencheikh, the physicist and host of the program \"Islam\" broadcast on France 2. After theological studies in family brotherhood and once aged 21, Sheikh Abbas studied at the Islamic University of Zaytuna in Tunis and that of al-Qarawiyyin in Fez. After ten years, he returned to Algeria and became the disciple of the reformer Abdelhamid Ben Badis. He campaigned with him for religious and political reform (commonly known as \"al-iṣlāḥ\" by Muslim reformists). At independence of Algeria, he was appointed ambassador to Saudi Arabia, following his resignation from the post he has held the office of President of the Supreme Islamic Council of Algeria, a seat he left by personal choice to pursue the weekly preaching in the Great Mosque of Algiers. In 1982, Sheikh Abbas took charge of the Great Mosque of Paris, succeeding Sheikh Hamza Boubakeur. He restructured the mosque by creating a second prayer room and putting in place many cultural services, social associations etc.. He allowed the mosque to receive a share of a specific budget from the Department of Endowments of Algeria and secondly to develop a body of imams whose number (80 imams) is still the same nowadays. He intervened to resolve the painful issue of divorce between binational families, especially in defending the rights of French mothers whose children had been brought in Algeria after the divorce. He also interjected to facilitate the return of many French-Muslims (Harkis) who had left the Algeria since independence in 1962 and stay there instead. He hosted many conferences in various regions of France (Lille, Lyon, Marseille...)."

In her Abhang she refers to herself as Chokhamela's Mahari, accuses god for forgetting Dalits and of making life bad. Her most basic verses concern the simple food she gives the god. Her poems describe her devotion towards god and voice her objections to untouchability. Soyarabai believed that \"The body only can be impure or polluted, but the soul is ever clean, pure knowledge. The body is born unclean and so how can anybody claim to be pure in body? The body has much pollution. But the pollution of the body remains in the body. The soul is untouched by it.\" Soyarabai undertook an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur with her husband. They were harassed by orthodox Brahmins but never lost their faith and peace of mind."

  "text" : "Sung Dong-il (born April 27, 1967) is a South Korean actor. Sung made his acting debut in theater in 1987, then was recruited at the 1991 SBS open talent auditions. He rose to fame as the comic, Jeolla dialect-speaking character \"Red Socks\" in the television drama Eun-shil, though he later tried to fight typecasting by playing the son of a chaebol tycoon in Love In 3 Colors and a university professor in March. Following years of supporting roles in TV, Sung's film career was jumpstarted by hit romantic comedy 200 Pounds Beauty in 2006. Subsequently, he became one of Korean cinema's most reliable supporting actors, displaying his comic skills and easy charm in films such as Take Off, Foxy Festival, Children..., The Suicide Forecast, and The Client. He also had major roles in The Suck Up Project: Mr. XXX-Kisser, 3D blockbuster Mr. Go, and mystery-comedy The Accidental Detective. On the small screen, Sung garnered praise as a villain in The Slave Hunters, and a gruff but caring father in Reply 1997 and its spin-offs Reply 1994 and Reply 1988. Sung gained a new surge of popularity in 2013 when he and his son Joon starred in Dad! Where Are We Going?, a reality/variety show featuring five male celebrities and their children on camping missions; his daughter Bin also joined him for the show's second season."

  "text" : "Silvio Ranieri (1882 – 1956) was an Italian Mandolin virutuoso. Born in Rome, he gave his first concert in 1897, aged fifteen, and he went on to tour Europe to great acclaim. It was his desire to elevate the Mandolin to a status similar to the violin in classical music, and he did much to contribute to the immense popularity of the mandolin in the 1920s. Later settling in Brussels he established a tradition of Mandolin music in northern Europe. He always played Mandolins produced by Luigi Embergher, which he compared to the Stradivarius violin in perfection. Ranieri once visited Embergher's shop in Rome and tried out an instrument marked Gold Medal Paris 1900. When he wanted to buy it the luthier replied that it was not for sale, but that he could play it at the evening recital. After the recital Embergher approached Ranieri and offered him the instrument as a gift."

  "text" : "Sydney Bourne (c. 1857- 1930) was the first chairman of Crystal Palace F.C.. Sydney Bourne was a local football enthusiast who joined the board of Crystal Palace at the invitation of Edmund Goodman. Goodman had stumbled upon Bourne's name after searching the records of FA Cup Final ticket sales. Noting that Bourne was a regular purchaser of tickets, he approached Bourne regarding the idea of a new club playing at the cup final venue. The Football League had frowned upon the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also owning a football team, so a separate company was being set up to found the new club, Crystal Palace. Bourne was very agreeable to the idea and joined the board of directors, being elected chairman at the club's first ever meeting. In 1909 Bourne was quoted in the press on the idea circulating at the time of the football players forming a trade union. Bourne wished to place a Director's view of the idea on the public record, and noted: \"nine out of ... ten clubs ... in England are ... insolvent, and are only kept alive by the personal sacrifices of their directors. If trade unionism is going to step in and interfere in every petty dispute there is not a director who will risk another shilling ... for the sport. (A)ny federation of players must work with their employers, and not against them.\" Bourne also oversaw the purchase of the land for and the building of the club's stadium, Selhurst Park."

It was at this time that Blanche Barton and Karla LaVey announced that they would run the Church of Satan as co-High Priestesses. Several days later, Barton produced a hand-written will claiming that LaVey had left all of his belongings, property, writings, and royalties, including the Church of Satan, for their son, to be put in a trust managed by Barton. Karla contested this will, which was later found to be invalid. A settlement was reached in which Anton LaVey’s belongings, writings, and royalties would be split among his three children, Karla, Zeena and Satan, and that Barton would receive the “corporation known as Church of Satan.”"

Nooruddin was initially appointed vice-chairman on 21 May 2013 but following the end of Ken Bates' tenure as chairman Nooruddin became chairman on 1 July 2013. It was later revealed that he had increased his stake in the club to 10%. In early 2014 GFH Capital sold their majority stake in the club to Italian Businessman Massimo Cellino who then became majority shareholder by 75% this means GFH Capitol would only retain a 5% stake in the club while Nooruddin would retain a 10% stake through his company Envest Ltd while he would also look after the 10% stake in the club owned by the International Investment Bank. In 2014 Nooruddin was removed as club chairman by new owner Massimo Cellino but would remain on the board of directors until April 2014 when he resigned from the board."

  "text" : "Samuel Stearns (1741-1810), was an American astronomer, doctor, author and publisher. Stearns was born 13 July 1741 at Bolton, Massachusetts. He lived at Paxton, Massachusetts, from 1771 until 1784, from there issuing his annual The North-American’s almanack. He moved to Brattleboro, Vermont, where his regular almanac became The Universal Calendar: and Northamerican Almanack. He also published the first ever nautical almanack (1792) to be printed in America. His trade was medicine but he also studied herbalism and astronomy. The book Annals of Brattleboro, 1681-1895 states of him that: \"His fame as an astronomer led many of the inhabitants to consult him on the turn of future events.\" Stearns was a British Loyalist during and after the American Revolutionary War, which caused him to be falsely accused of several crimes and falsely imprisoned. He was forced at various times to flee to the British, first in Long Island, New York (1780–83), later to Britain itself. In 1790 he took a degree from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, and travelled in Europe. He returned to America and died at Brattleboro on 8 August 1810. He was buried at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Brattleboro. His sister married William Herschel, the astronomer. The Stearns papers are held at 2013 as: \"Stearns, Samuel, Papers, 1784-1810; 1904-1935\", as part of the American Antiquarian Society's Manuscript Collections. Works: \n*  The American Herbal or Materia Medica (1801) (Part of his larger North American Dispensatory, a uniform textbook for medical treatment). \n*  The American Oracle (1791) (his collected contributions to The Philadelphia Magazine of which he was the editor for a short time, on recent discoveries in the arts and sciences). \n*  The mystery of animal magnetism revealed (1791, a debunking account). \n*  Dr. Stearns's Tour from London to Paris (1790). \n*  A Tour in Holland, by an American (1790).

  "text" : "Sudhir Saha (1918–1998) was a wrestler, coach and wrestling administrator in India. He introduced Greco-Roman wrestling in India. Sudhir Saha was the youngest son of Nandalal Saha and started wrestling at the age of six. Sudhir Saha was trained by his father Nandalal Saha, and subsequently by Ustad (meaning 'expert' in Hindi, a title commonly given to coaches) Majid Palwan from Lahore. Sudhir won the West Bengal State Wrestling Championship from the year 1935-1944 in the freestyle wrestling category. In the 1940 Senior National Wrestling Championship, Sudhir placed first in the middleweight category. After his wrestling career, Sudhir devoted his time to coaching and judge/refereeing. During his early coaching career, K.P. Rai and Nirmal Bose, from Panchanan Bayam Samity, one of India's oldest wrestling club, represented India in the 1948 London Olympics. Four years later, the 1952 Helsinki Olympic training camp was held at Panchanan Bayam Samity. Two of Sudhir's trainees, Nirmal Bose and Niranjan Das, from Panchanan Bayam Samity represented India in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. One of Sudhir's trainees, K.D. Jadhav, won the bronze medal in the Bantam weight Category in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. This was independent India's first individual Olympic medal. In 1957, Sudhir Saha attended the first Fédération Internationale des Luttes Associées (FILA) Judge/Referee clinic for technical officials in Paris, with the aim of officials coming together to discuss theory and practicals on wrestling techniques and minute details of officiating. This is where he obtained his international judge/referee license. In 1961, Sudhir Saha completed his International Coaching degree from Japan. He was also the Joint Secretary and Vice President of Wrestling Federation of India; General Secretary, West Bengal Wrestling Federation; and he was responsible for technical positions such as Mat Chairman, Member of the Selection Committee, Chairman of the Greco-Roman Style in India, and the Judge/Referee Association of India. He started his refereeing career in 1953, supervising more than 1500 wrestling bouts. In the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan, Sudhir represented India as a wrestling judge/referee."

  "text" : "Siegfried Wiessner (born 26 February 1953 in Germany) is a Professor of Law and the Founder and Director of St. Thomas University’s Graduate Program in Intercultural Human Rights in Miami, Florida.He holds a law degree (1977) as well as a Dr. iur. (1989) from the University of Tübingen, Germany, and an LL.M. from the Yale Law School (1982). In 1986, he was elected member of the International Institute of Space Law. He is the Editor-in-Chief of Martinus Nijhoff’s Studies in Intercultural Human Rights. From 1997 to 2000, he was a Lecturer at the UN/UNITAR International Law Fellowship Program. In October 2009 and November 2010, he served as Visiting Professor of Law at the City University of Hong Kong. In fall 2009, he was a Fernand Braudel Senior Fellow at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. From 2007 to 2010, he was a member of the Executive Council of The American Society of International Law. From 2008 to 2012, he served as the Chair of the International Law Association’s Committee on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Professor Wiessner teaches U.S. Constitutional Law and International Law. He has published widely in the fields of constitutional law, international law, human rights, international indigenous law, the law of armed conflict, arbitration, space law and refugee law. In 1989, he published a book on the function of nationality, and he is the co-author, with Michael Reisman of the Yale Law School, of a leading casebook on international law, International Law in Contemporary Perspective (2004).Throughout his life, Professor Wiessner has pushed the envelope in favor of social justice, protection of the poor and marginalized. In Germany, as a young lawyer in 1980, he safeguarded the due process rights of asylum seekers through a novel interpretation of the country’s constitution which was, in essence, adopted by the country’s Federal Constitutional Court. Coming to Yale Law School in 1982, he was immersed in that institution’s distinctive problem-oriented approach to law, saw it as a liberation from the straitjacket of positivism, and redefined the role of the lawyer as leader and problem solver in society, a “doctor of the social order.” By taking into account conflicting claims, past trends in decision and evaluating past decisions in light of a public order of human dignity, he suggests developing decisions best suited to maximize access by all to all things humans value. He applied this “New Haven Approach” to issues of mass atrocities as well as conflicts over the allocation of resources. His main contribution to an order of human dignity worldwide has been, as of yet, his research on, and subsequent development of, the law regarding the rights and status of indigenous peoples. He first made the argument, laid out in the Harvard Human Rights Journal in 1999, that customary international law protects indigenous peoples’ rights to land, their cultural traditions, and self-government. As Chair of the International Law Association’s Committee on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples he led 30 experts from around the globe to a thorough review of this position, culminating in the organization’s emphatic approval of Resolution No. 5/2012 confirming those rights to their lands, culture and autonomy at its meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria in August 2012. His other abiding achievement is the creation of the Graduate Program in Intercultural Human Rights, founded in 2001. This combination of a unique and most successful LL.M. Program with a highly selective J.S.D. program requiring publication of students’ theses has made St. Thomas known and respected globally and locally. Many graduates of the program are now working in the field and transporting values of human dignity. In the 303 students graduating from the LL.M. program so far, it sent out “warriors for dignity” who are confidently using the arms of the law and other peaceful instruments to bring about positive change in all four corners of the world.On March 14, 2013, Professor Wiessner received the Law Professor of the Year Award by the humanitarian organization Lawyers to the Rescue."

  "text" : "Simon Donato PhD, (born July 10, 1976) is a Canadian geologist, entrepreneur, television host, world-renowned explorer, and ultra-endurance athlete. He is best known for hosting the television series, Boundless, and is the founder of both Adventure Science and Stoked Oats. A life-time athlete, Simon grew up ski racing (and coaching), studying Kenpo Karate, playing soccer, football, and baseball, before falling in love with mountain biking and adventure racing. Since then, Simon has become an accomplished ultra-endurance athlete, having competed in numerous adventure races and ultra marathons. After completing an undergraduate degree in anthropology and biology, he obtained an MSc in paleontology at Western University. He received his PhD in geology from McMaster University 2008 during which time he founded and ran the Canadian Adventure Racing Association, which is still in existence today, and provides insurance, safety, and environmental guidelines to Canadian race directors. In 2008, he also founded Adventure Science, a company that combined his passion for field-based research with ultra-endurance athletics as a way of giving back, and making a difference. The first project was a search for then missing pilot, Steve Fossett. Since 2008, Adventure Science has conducted eight projects, ranging from studying the relationship between ultra-running and muscle damage, to searching for undiscovered archaeological ruins in the Middle East, to searching for missing people and airplanes. After graduation Simon began work as a geologist for Imperial Oil (ExxonMobil) in Calgary, AB, and spent over four years working on a wide variety of projects from the Athabasca oil sands to the Beaufort Sea. While still working for Imperial Oil, Simon co-founded Stoked Oats Ltd. with Brad Slessor and Shaun Stevens of Calgary (April 2011). They started the company to fill the need for a healthy, gluten-free oatmeal option in grocery stores that was sugar, salt, and preservative free, but still delivered a high amount of nutrients and protein per serving. Stoked Oats hit the market in June 2012. In July 2012, with Josh and Jordan Eady of Eady Bros Productions, and HLP + Partners, Simon launched a new television series called Boundless. The idea for the series grew from his documentary “Go Death Racer”. During the shooting for Boundless, he, and long-time friend Paul Trebilcock, traveled the globe for 126 days competing in 8 grueling ultra-endurance races, ranging from stand-up paddle boarding, to running across the Sahara desert. He is currently filming season 3."

  "text" : "Suresh Sriskandarajah is a Canadian citizen who fell under suspicion from US security officials of providing illegal support for the Tamil Tigers. Sriskandarajah was born in Sri Lanka. In 1989 his family fled to Montreal to avoid the violent civil war taking place in the northern part of the country. Sriskandarajah enrolled in the electrical engineering program at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario. All Waterloo Engineering students participate in a co-op program, where they alternate one work term with one study term. Sriskandarajah spent two of his six co-op work terms on jobs in Sri Lanka. Just prior to his second 2005 work term, Sri Lanka's coast was one of the regions that suffered from the devastating Dec. 26, 2004 Tsunami that swept the Indian Ocean.Sriskandarajah would later describe abandoning his co-op work to join in trying to rescue survivors and make sure they were fed, housed and received medical care. In these accounts he described working with members of the Tamil Tigers. Sriskandarajah has been described as a gifted student, who was also active in campus activities, including a leadership role in the Tamil students association, and working on The Imprint the independent student newspaper.Sriskandarajah founded a web design company after earning his undergrad degree, and enrolled in the Master of Business Administration program at Wilfrid Laurier University—down the street from the University of Waterloo, in Waterloo, Ontario. American security officials sought to extradite Sriskandarajah in 2006, while he was working on his MBA. Sriskandarajah was released on bail, during the long extradition process, and completed his MBA. In May 2010 Sriskandarajah agreed to be interviewed by Stewart Bell, of the National Post—his first interview since the US initiated its extradition request in 2006. In January 2011 the Ontario Court of Appeals turned down his appeal of that extradition request.On December 14, 2012 the Supreme Court of Canada also rejected his appeal, and that of two other men. Although he had insisted on his innocence for over six years Sriskandarajah pleaded guilty on July 3, 2013, about six months after his extradition."

She could speak English, French, Cree and Michif and in 1871  was sent to Île-à-la-Crosse where her father Jean-Louis Riel was born. She served in the school and the hospital of the mission until her death of tuberculosis December 27, 1883. She took the name Sister Marguerite-Marie in 1872 and is buried under that name at the cemetery in Île-à-la-Crosse. Her headstone in French reads: Ici Repose Rév. Soeur Marguerite Marie (Riel) Decédée 27 Decembre, 1883, Agée 34 ans, R.I.P. She and her brother Louis Riel wrote to each other and letters remain describing their relationship and her life in Île-à-la-Crosse. On April 27, 1885, the day after the Green Lake Post was looted during the North-West Rebellion, the Grey Nuns of Île-à-la-Crosse, terrified that Riel who had accused them of letting his younger sister die in misery would seek revenge, fled the village along with most of the personnel and dependants of the Hudson's Bay Company Post and the Roman Catholic Mission. The large group camped on a small wooded island north of Patuanak until the crisis was over and returned to Île-à-la-Crosse on May 29."

  "text" : "Shereen El Feki (born 1967 or 1968) is a British journalist and author, most notable for her book Sex and the Citadel: Intimate Life in a Changing Arab World. El Feki was born in Great Britain to a Welsh mother and an Egyptian father. She grew up in Canada, visiting her grandmother in Cairo on a regular basis. After graduating from the University of Toronto with a BSc in immunology in 1991, then obtaining an MPhil and PhD in immunology from the University of Cambridge, she joined The Economist as healthcare correspondent in 1998. After the 2001 WTC terror attacks, she learned Arabic and started to research the Middle East, in particular, the issues of emancipation and women's sexuality, spending much of her time in Egypt. In 2005, she left the Economist, and from 2006 to 2008, she hosted weekly shows, People & Power and The Pulse, on Al Jazeera International. From 2010 to 2012, she was vice-chairwoman of the United Nations’ Global Commission on H.I.V. and the Law. In 2013, El Feki published Sex and the Citadel: Intimate Life in a Changing Arab World, which has been translated into Dutch, Bahasa Indonesia, French and German, with Spanish and Arabic translations forthcoming. \"Sex and the Citadel\" has been nominated for the Guardian First Book Award and The Orwell Prize; El Feki's TED talk on sexuality in the Arab region has received almost 1 million views since 2014. The book surveys sexual attitudes of women and men in Egypt and the wider Arab world, and presents results of her five years of research. El Feki concludes that taboos around sexuality are starting to be challenged in the Arab societies, and that such debates in personal life are key to change in the politics, economics and the broader public sphere. However, she warns that such change comes \"by evolution, not revolution\" over a generation at least."

Stafford was the third husband of Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby. The marriage was relatively long and successful and coincided roughly with the minority of Margaret's son, the future Henry VII of England. Both Sir Henry and Lady Margaret were descended from John of Gaunt and were supporters of Henry VI, the head of the House of Lancaster, in the early stages of the Wars of the Roses. However, Stafford later switched his allegiance to the House of York and towards the end of his life contributed to the restoration of Edward IV."

He received an OMD from the Wushu Traditional Chinese School of Medicine in Anhui in 1978, and a MS in Exercise Physiology from the University of South Alabama in 1991. Although he is technically a Chinese Buddhist monk, he does not consider himself one, instead stating that he is just \"an ordinary Shaolin disciple who happened, since childhood, to have been traveling in Chan.\" From 1993–2003 he served as chief referee for U.S. National and International sanshou competitions. Beginning in 1994, he became head coach of the U.S. Wushu-Kungfu Federation National Sanshou Team. Under his coaching, the team won international victories and produced 5 World Champions. In 1999 he opened the LIU Shaolin Institute in Mobile, where he taught kung fu, tai chi, qigong, sanshou, and practiced Chinese traditional medicine. Since then, the Institute has opened additional campuses in New Orleans and Atlanta. Notable alumni of the Shaolin Institute include Cung Le and Patrick Barry, a UFC fighter who studied sanshou with Shi Deru and traveled with him to the Shaolin Temple three times to train. On 1 August 2002, he was assaulted by townspeople near the Shaolin Temple, who associated him with the appointed abbot Shi Yongxin. He refrained from retaliating, and was beaten and stoned until elderly people in the crowd recognized him and intervened."

In 1959, he was in the trumpet section with Benny Bailey and George Ernzst in Oscar Pettiford's All Stars band, which also featured Albert Mangelsdorff and drummer Joe Harris. Back in the UK, in the early 1960s Hamer led a quintet featuring Tony Archer and Harold McNair. In 1966, he was in the Ronnie Ross Big Band which was recorded live for NDR. In 1968, he played in the trumpet sections, alongside Dizzy Reece, of two line-ups led by Dizzy Gillespie, the Dizzy Gillespie Reunion Big Band in Berlin, and Dizzy Gillespie and his Orchestra. Around that time he was also a member of the Joe Harriott Quintet, with Pat Smythe, Coleridge Goode, and Phil Seamen. He later focused on African music, living for some time in Africa and performing in London with African musicians including Ghanaian (UK based) band Hi-Life International."

He then went to London, where he played at the Flamingo jazz club, among other jazz venues. Moving on to Paris, in March 1967, he was one of the pianists, the others being Joe \"Stride\" Turner, Errol Parker, Claude Bolling, Michel Sardaby, and Aaron Bridgers, accompanied on some tracks by bassist John Lamb, among others, who recorded the 90-minute session known as Tape for Billy, dedicated to Billy Strayhorn, who was in hospital. Duke Ellington, also in Paris, personally supervised the recording, although he didn't actually perform on it himself, and wanted to use the proceeds from its sale to create a Billy Strayhorn scholarship in Paris, similar to the one at Juilliard in New York. From Paris he went on to Barcelona backing Ruth Brown as part of a trio with Ron Jefferson, who had just left the West Coast. In 1970, Stuart starred as supporting character Ranji in the controversial film Tropic of Cancer (film) alongside Rip Torn & Academy Award winning actress Ellen Burstyn. In 1986 he moved to Sydney, Australia where he finally retired from the music business. On August 16, 2015, Stuart died in Sydney, Australia."

  "text" : "Samuel Warren Hamilton, M.D. (1898-1951) was an American physician and psychiatrist who was an expert in the organization of mental hospitals. Hamilton was born in Brandon, Vermont, and the fourth generation of physicians. He attended local public schools. He entered the University of Vermont and earned his A. B. degree in 1898. His medical education was at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and earned his M.D. in 1903. He spent a year in training at the Children’s Hospital of New York followed by a year at the Lying-in Hospital of the City of New York. From 1905 to 1909, he served as an assistant physician at the Manhattan State Mental Hospital, and then transferred to the Utica State Hospital (New York State Lunatic Asylum), where he served as a psychiatrist from 1910 to 1916. Between 1911 and 1912, he studied at the University of Breslau, Germany, and worked in the mental and nervous clinics. In 1917, he became director of the New York Police’s new Police Psychopathic Laboratory. However, with the start of World War I, Hamilton entered the U.S. Army. He spent two years as a psychiatrist with the 42nd Division and the Third Army. Upon his return from Europe, he became the Medical Director at the Philadelphia Hospital for Mental Disorder and served in this position from 1920 to 1922. Then, he took the position of Assistant Medical Director at the private hospital, Bloomingdale Insane Asylum which was affiliated with the Cornell Medical School and the New York Hospital. He remained at Bloomingdale from 1923 to 1936. During those years, he also served as director of Hospital Service for the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, a voluntary lay organization. This period began a career of surveys of public mental hospitals under the auspices of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene and later, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Neurological Association, the U.S. Public Health Service, and the Rockefeller Foundation. Hamilton’s experience in state mental hospitals came to the fore in the 1930s. The public mental hospitals in the various states had become overcrowded, understaffed, and received inadequate funding. Public interest had been aroused by publications of hospitals’’ conditions. In 1935, the American Medical Association (AMA) began an investigation at the instigation of its Mental Health committee. The AMA surveys were discontinued and only a statistical report of the findings was published, with no known further action. Later, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) took up the effort and joined the national and state mental health associations in the effort to improve conditions in the mental hospitals. In 1928, the State Society for Mental Health of Connecticut obtained funds to conduct a survey of mental hospitals, under the direction of Hamilton. The survey was published in 1936 with numerous recommendations. The survey reports met wide acceptance as numerous states began obtaining funds for similar surveys, which often resulted in increased funding by state legislatures to improve conditions in the state mental hospitals. Hamilton taught during his various posts: the Canandaigua Academy in New York (1898-1899), the Allen School in New York (1900-1901), the Women’s Medical College of New York (1920-1922), Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the Post Graduate School of Medicine (1920-1925). He was a member of numerous professional organizations: the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Psychopathological Association (President in 1938), and the American Psychiatric Association (APA, president in 1946-1947). He served as an advisor to the U.S. Public Health Service from 1939 to 1947, and was an active participant in the founding of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. Following his U.S. Army service during World War II, Hamilton accepted the position as Superintendent of the Essex Overbrook Hospital in New Jersey. He stayed there until 1950. He returned to Burlington, Vermont to continue his consultant activities. In 1951, the Governor of Vermont requested Hamilton’s expertise with the Women’s State Reformatory in Rutland, Vermont. He died of a heart attack in 1951."

A childcare worker, Susanne Wiest is well known in Germany for having launched a petition to the German Parliament asking for the implementation of a basic income of 1,000 Euros a month. The petition went so viral that not only did it receive more than 52,000 signatures of support, but the hosting services were overloaded in the last days of the collection period, forcing the Bundestag to extend the duration of the petition for one week. The petition then was accepted and Susanne Wiest was invited for a hearing at the Bundestag's Commission of Petitions. The hearing took place on November 8, 2010 following which Wiest was featured in the German media. In June 2013, the petition was finally closed by the Parliament, thus depriving the supporters of basic income of any parliamentary debate on the issue. Susanne Wiest ran in the legislative elections in 2009 as a free candidate. She received 1,2% of the votes cast. Since December 2012, she has been a member of the Pirate Party of Germany."

  "text" : "Skinnar Per Andersson from Sollerön (1703 – January 30, 1744) was a farmer from Dalarna, member of the Swedish Riksdag representing parts of Dalarna and one of the key leaders of the Dalecarlian Rebellion of 1743. Andersson had appeared at a landsting in 1742 (gathered on the request of the commoners of Dalarna), where he emerged as the most prominent opponent of the government and the Estates. He was elected to the Riksdag by the delegation from Dalarna. Notably, his mandate was conditioned by a written contract which stipulated that his pay as Riksdag delegate would depend on what kind of improvements he would bring to the peasantry. Andersson's constituency covered the bailiwicks of Upper Siljan, Lower Siljan and Western Dalarna, as well as Gagnef and Svärdsjö. In regards to the issue of the royal succession, Andersson supported the claim to the throne of the Danish crown prince Fredrik. In the Riksdag Andersson participated in the commission that had been assigned to audit the war efforts. He returned to Dalarna, where he participated in a meeting of parish delegates in Leksand on March 12, 1743, during which he called on the people of Dalarna to resist recruitment to the army. Andersson had brought a morning star to the meeting, and whilst the county governor was speaking in favour of releasing recruits to the army the weapon was slammed into the ceiling of the meeting hall. Andersson travelled back to Stockholm, whereby he moderated his stance on the recruitment issue. However, he was unable to convince his constituents. Back in Dalarna (where an armed rebellion was being organized), he argued at a meeting in Lisseby for postponement of the march on Stockholm for two weeks. Once the march towards Stockholm began, he joined it. Skinnar Per Andersson was sentenced to death by the Svea Hovrätt court of appeals on January 9, 1744. He was executed on January 30, 1744 along with a number of other leaders of the rebellion."

  "text" : "Sheila Hazel Whitaker (1 April 1936 – 29 July 2013) was an English film programmer and writer. Whitaker was born in Thornton Heath, south London and grew up in the north of the city, and Manchester, Cardiff and Birmingham after the Second World War. She was appointed to oversee the British Film Institute's stills, posters and designs collections in 1968, leaving in 1975 to study for her degree in Comparative European Literature at Warwick University. At a difficult time for the venue, in 1979 she became director of the Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle, also running Tyneside Festival of Independent Cinema at the same time which she founded. While head of programming of the National Film Theatre from 1984-90, Whitaker became director of the London Film Festival, remaining in the latter post from 1987 to 1996, when her contract was not renewed by the BFI to Whitaker's disappointment. During her period as director, Whitaker expanded the festival. About 90% of tickets had previously been bought by members of the NFT, at which the festival was then largely based, but Whitaker expanded the event to include other venues in the capital. By the end of her tenure as director, the LFF had grown to include screenings of over 200 films from around the world. She also began the festival's practice of including newly restored films from the National Film Archive and overseas institutions. She was the director of International Programming for the Dubai International Film Festival from 2008; she had been a consultant for the event since 2004. With others, she co-edited Life and Art: The New Iranian Cinema (1999), and An Argentine Passion, (2000) about the Argentinian film director María Luisa Bemberg. Sheila Whitaker was a recipient of the Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for services to French cinema in Britain, an award which coincided with the end of her time as director of the London Film Festival, and honorary doctorates from Newcastle and Warwick Universities. She died in London after suffering from motor neuron disease."

She had a four-year-old daughter. After obtaining the initial licence, she persevered on and completed one thousand hours of flying in the aircraft owned by the Lahore Flying Club. Her husband P. D. Sharma whom she married at 16 and comes from a family which had 9 pilots encouraged her to achieve it. She was the first Indian to get airmail pilot's licence and flew between Karachi and Lahore and also first woman pilot to obtain 'A’ license when she accumulated over 1000 hours of flying. While she was working towards the commercial pilot license in 1939, World War II broke out and civil training was suspended. Later her husband died in a crash. She abandoned her plans to become a commercial pilot, returned to Lahore and joined the Mayo School of Art where she trained in the Bengal school of painting and obtained a diploma in fine arts. She was also a dedicated follower of the Arya Samaj. After the Partition she moved to Delhi with her two daughters where she met her second husband R. P. Thakral and married him in 1948.

  "text" : "Shankarrao Salvi (15 July 1931 – 15 February 2007) was an Indian Kabaddi player, coach and administrator. He was life president of Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India. Salvi is described as a persuasive speaker. His efforts in the field resulted in the merging of \"hu tu tu\" into a standardised version of kabaddi. Hu tu tu, a traditional game similar to kabaddi, played in Maharashtra has nine players per side whereas the standard kabaddi is played with seven players per side. Traditionalists in Maharashtra had resisted replacement of the word \"hu tu tu\" with \"kabaddi\" a word more common in northern India. They had persisted in their resistance even after its acceptance in the southern India states. Salvi was a Royist, who cultivated good relations with the state government and lobbied with chief ministers of Maharashtra, to obtain state patronage for Kabaddi. He didn't abuse his contacts for personal benefits; when asked by the Chief Minister what he wanted, Salvi even though he lived in a rented house, requested for space for an administrative office for kabaddi. Salvi travelled widely to popularise kabaddi. In the 1970s, Salvi organised tours to Bangladesh and Japan. His efforts lead to the popularisation of the sport internationally and its being played in the Asian Games in 1990 where India won the Gold medal. He was a member of the working committee of the International Kabaddi Federation when the foundation was created in 2004. Salvi received the \"Shiv Chhatrapati Rajya Krida Jivan Gaurav Puraskar\", awarded by the Government of Maharashtra to sportspersons from Maharashtra for lifetime contribution to sports in 2005.He is popularly referred to as \"Buwa Salvi\" and honorarily as \"Kabaddi Maharashi\" or the grand old man of Kabaddi. He died on 15 February 2007 at the age of 75 in Mumbai. The 27th Federation Cup Kabaddi Tournament, held in May 2007 in Mumbai and organised by Maharashtra State Kabaddi Association was dedicated to Salvi. His birthday, 15 July, is observed as Kabaddi Din (\"Kabaddi Day\") in Maharashtra. The venue of the 57th Maharashtra State Kabaddi Championship was named after him as \"Late Shankarrao Salvi Krida Nagri\"."

  "text" : "Shakey Jake (sometimes “Shakin’ Jake”) (August 24, 1925 – September 16, 2007), born Jake Woods in Little Rock, Arkansas, was a street musician and storyteller well known to students and residents of Ann Arbor, Michigan, from the time of his arrival there in 1973 until his death. Woods, who had moved as a child with his family from Little Rock to Saginaw, Michigan, travelled from Saginaw to Ann Arbor for a brief appearance at the Ann Arbor Blues Festival in 1973, and decided to stay. Jake could be seen regularly on the streets of Ann Arbor in his unconventional clothing, strumming his guitar and singing (generally tuneless) songs to passers-by. He also sold cassettes and CDs of his music, and T-shirts and bumper stickers bearing the slogan, “I brake for Jake”. In conversation, Jake enjoyed recounting a variety of implausible stories about his life and upbringing – claiming, for example, that he had been born on Halloween in 1900 and was 104 years old, that he had been a smoker since the age of one, or that he had dozens of invisible bodyguards. Despite his disheveled appearance and quirky conversational style, Jake was unthreatening, and was well-liked by those who knew – or even merely knew of – him. Indeed, he was a welcome patron at many Ann Arbor retail establishments. By many accounts, Jake was one of the most popular parts of the city's annual 4 July parade.Although many believed him to be homeless, he lived in rented rooms or in public housing. Shakey Jake was the inspiration for Calhoun Tubbs, a sketch character created and portrayed by David Alan Grier in the television comedy series In Living Color. Jake died in 2007 of kidney failure, at the age of 82. A memorial service drew 400 mourners. Afterwards a smaller group paraded for an hour through the streets of Ann Arbor past some of Jake’s favorite spots, singing songs and playing instruments."

Leopold and at least two of the other sons became bankers and important figures in Polish politics, and several of his children married into other aristocratic families. Only his eldest son, Ludwik Kronenberg (1783–1882), was considered Jewish thereafter."

  "text" : "Sam Mendel (1811–1884), the \"Merchant Prince\", was one of the leading merchants in Manchester during its rise to industrial prominence. He was born in Liverpool, but the family soon relocated to Manchester where his father, Emmanuel, established a rope, twine, and pitch-paper business and then later a hotel, the Manchester and Liverpool (subsequently known as Mendel's Hotel). Samuel first worked in a warehouse on Bow Street belonging to Mr. B. Liebert, and during this time he also travelled extensively. Building on his experience he began his own business and rapidly became one of Manchester's leading textile merchants. He built a large warehouse, Chepstow House, in central Manchester. At first he resided at Greenheys Priory, formerly the family home of Thomas De Quincey. He then built a substantial mansion, Manley Hall, in Whalley Range and filled it with an impressive collection of art (much of it acquired with the aid of the noted art dealers Thomas Agnew & Sons). While resident there he converted from Judaism to High Church Anglicanism and became a trustee of St Clement's Church, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, despite not residing in the Parish. Along with another trustee, William Cunliffe Brooks, he controversially opposed the building of the new, larger church. He was also the patron of the village brass band. Due to difficulties with his business, caused by the alterations to trade arising from the opening of the Suez Canal, he was forced into bankruptcy in 1875. His later years were spent in reduced circumstances in Chislehurst. He died in Balham in 1884."

In order to join the Uzbek drama theatre, which was founded in the 1920s, he had to leave home because his family's orthodox religious beliefs forbade acting. At the time Uzbek theatre was still in its infancy. In 1930 he received training at the Moscow Art Theatre, which he credited as enabling him to play classic roles such as Romeo, Hamlet, and Œdipus. Burkhanov was involved in Uzbek cinema from its very inception. The Uzbekfilm studio typecast him as a rebel who challenged the old order and traditions. In the early 1970s he was the subject of a documentary, People's Artist Shukur Burkhanov, narrated by fellow actor Boris Andreyev."

  "text" : "Sadie Kneller Miller (October 7, 1867 – November 21, 1920) was a Baltimore journalist, known for being one of the earliest female baseball reporters, as well as the only female correspondent covering some international events. Miller was born in Westminster, Maryland. She graduated from Western Maryland College in 1885 and worked as a journalist for the Westminster Democratic Advocate. She then moved to Baltimore with her parents and started working for the Baltimore Telegram. At the Telegram she began covering the Baltimore Orioles in 1894 by disguising herself as a man; only after her female identity was found out was she known as the “only woman baseball reporter in the country”. She moved on to photography, submitting photos of Spanish–American War activities from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis to Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly, securing her a position there. At Leslie’s, Miller covered stories such as the Baltimore Fire of 1904, the presidential inauguration of Howard Taft, and Democratic party conventions. She also photographed portraits of Susan B. Anthony and Teddy Roosevelt. Miller was a professional journalist, but most people did not know she was a woman. She wrote with the byline \"SKM\", which hid her female identity. She may have been the first woman to cover major league baseball and is one of the few to combine photography with journalism. While on national tour with the Orioles in 1897, her gender was \"discovered\". She became the world's first female war correspondent while covering the fighting in Morocco between Spanish forces and the Moors in 1909. While working on an assignment in Germany, she was arrested as a spy. She also wrote on the Yukon Gold Rush and did interviews from several countries including Cuba, Czarist Russia, and Turkey. Her most reprinted interview was with Pancho Villa, a Mexican Revolutionary general in 1916 at his guerrilla base. A stroke in 1918 forced Miller to retire from Leslie's Illustrated Weekly, ending her career as a journalist. She died two years later. Her name was added to the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 1988."

  "text" : "Selma Barkham, OC, (née Huxley; born 1927, London, England) is a Canadian historian and geographer of international standing in the fields of the maritime history of Canada and of the Basque Country. In 1972, as an independent researcher, she moved to the Basque Country to do archival research on an aspect of Canadian and Basque history about which very little was known: Basque fisheries in the old Terra Nova, today some 2,000 kilometres of the Atlantic coast of Canada, in the 16th and 17th centuries. The research she carried out during the following years, mostly in Basque, Spanish and Portuguese archives, allowed her to make important archival, historical and archaeological discoveries. She found thousands of documents with which she was able to reconstruct most elements of a largely unknown chapter of the history of Canada and of the Basque Country: the Basque cod and whale fisheries in Terra Nova especially in the 16th century. She discovered the existence of a 16th-century Basque whaling industry in southern Labrador and adjacent Quebec, their whaling ports, archaeological remains of their bases, as well as the presence of Basque galleons sunk in those ports, among them the San Juan (1565). In 1981, she was awarded the Order of Canada for her pioneering work and for having made \"one of the most outstanding contributions, in recent years, to the story of this nation\". One of those whaling ports found by her, present-day Red Bay, Labrador, has been declared a National Historic Site of Canada (1979) and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (June 2013)."

  "text" : "Maharana Shambhu Singh GCSI (22 December 1847 - 7 October 1874), was the Maharana (r. 1861 - 1874) of Princely state of Udaipur. He was a son Shardul Singh and adopted son of Maharana Swarup Singh.The rich and diverse land of India had faced numerous invasions and marauding before the British set their foot as merchants and slowly took over the dominance of the Indian main land. With the great Indian rebellion of 1857, the governance of India was transferred to the Queen and a new era had begun with Maharana Shambhu Singh ascending the throne of Mewar. Maharana Shambhu Singh, son of Shardul Singh from the Bagore branch of Mewar, the descendants of Maharana Sangram Singh II; was adopted by Maharana Swarup Singh as his nominated heir. Maharana Shambhu Singh ascended the throne as a minor and a British Political agent was appointed to guide the young Maharana. Unlike his predecessors, the financial conditions at the time were relatively stable and progressive and Shambhu Singh continued to replenish the state treasury, after he was provided full powers as the king of Mewar. After attaining complete control, he set up various new rules and offices for improving administrative resources, organised administration and income of temples and sacred places and introduced new legal code for Mewar. Under him the military was reorganised, various jail reforms were introduced and new construction of roads and railway tracks started. In spite of being formally uneducated, he gave education supreme importance and expanded various existing schools and introduced numerous new ones. Most importantly, he was the first to set up a school for girls and thus promoted opportunities of education for everyone. He enforced special measures to curb the Sati pratha and imposed heavy monetary fines on offenders. Thus with various reforms in public facilities and infrastructure, Maharana Shambhu Singh was considered a liberal and well managed king of his times. But with his untimely death at a young age of twenty seven years, his dreams of revival of his homeland to the ancient golden times were stalled. He left behind no heir and his cousin Sajjan Singh, who himself was a minor at the time of his death; succeeded him and went ahead in continuation with the reforms paved by his predecessor, Late Shambhu Singh."

She was prominent in the Spanish social and political spheres in the second half of the 19th century through her influence over Queen Isabel II and the queen's husband, King Francisco de Asís de Borbón. Sor Patrocinio's reported mystical experiences and supernatural phenomena have been a source of controversy, at the time and later. She was instrumental in the founding or reform of many monasteries of the Order in both Spain and France. The cause for her beatification is currently being studied by the Holy See."

  "text" : "Samuel Honeyman Kneass (1806–1858) was an American civil engineer and architect. Kneass was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 5, 1806. He was the elder son of William Kneass (1781-1840), who would go on to become the second Chief Engraver of the United States Mint, and the older brother of engineer Strickland Kneass (1821-1884). At age 15, Samuel joined the Philadelphia architectural firm of William Strickland, with which he helped build the headquarters building of the Second Bank of the United States, survey the route of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, and build the Susquehanna division of the Pennsylvania state canal. In 1837 and 1838, Kneass was the lead engineer during the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad's construction of the Newkirk Viaduct, the Schuylkill River bridge that completed the first rail link between the cities. His service is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument in Philadelphia. On March 14, 1837, Kneass married Anna Lombaert (1814-1869) in Morrisville, Pennsylvania. Anna was a daughter of Charles Lombaert, who was one of the PW&B's three superintendents. From 1849 to 1853, Kneass was the Chief Surveyor and Regulator for Philadelphia. His 1853 report to the city was \"the first attempt to systematize the disparate sewers and sewerage systems in place in various municipalities around the time of Philadelphia's consolidation.\" He was succeeded in the job by his younger brother, Strickland, who served as Chief Engineer & Surveyor from the city's consolidation in 1855 until his retirement in 1872. Kneass died in Philadelphia on February 15, 1858, and was buried in that city's Woodlands Cemetery."

  "text" : "Susan Bissell is UNICEF's Child Protection Section chief. She is a Doctor of Philosophy. She does not oppose international adoption, but believes that it is preferable for abandoned children to be taken back by their previous families and advises governments to provide small monetary incentives to families who are willing to do so. She opposes the concept that there is a global orphan crisis, and believes that \"the crisis is something else... a child protection crisis.\" In 2000, her research on child labour in Bangladesh was published. In 2007, she spoke at the Atlantic Canada Child Welfare Forum in Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada, saying that the country should prohibit all forms of corporal punishment in the home, including spanking. In 2009, she spoke in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, saying that steps needed to be taken in the country to address the causes of child labour. She identified the abolishment of primary school tuition payments as a good way to address these causes. In 2011, when UNICEF was criticized for not acting on non-governmental organizations' claims that there was systematic use of child labour in Uzbekistan, Bissell said, \"We're not police. We're not monitors.\" After acting in Taken, a film about the trafficking of children, Liam Neeson was inspired to combat child abuse, and, in July 2013, Bissell voiced her belief that Neeson's work on this issue would be effective. Bissell is an Observer for WeProtect which is a global non-profit cooperation with the goal to protect children online and stop the crime of online child sexual abuse and exploitation."

  "text" : "Stepan Papelyan (Armenian: Ստեփան Բաբէլեան; 1875 - 1960) was an Armenian pedagogue, composer and writer. Papelyan was born in Scutari (now Üsküdar) district of Constantinople [now Istanbul] in the Ottoman Empire. He attended the Berberian School and displayed an early interest in music. There he studied the piano with Avedis Horasandjian and later with composer Haroutioun Sinanian. However, his real calling was teaching. Papelyan developed the principles of his teaching method by examining various treatises on educational philosophy, by learning from experience and by reflecting on the act of performance itself. He was the first teacher to organize student recitals in Istanbul, which proved to be a huge success both for the students and their parents. Following the concerts Papelyan would also write a critique of each student’s progress and accordingly move him or her to an appropriate class. After the Great Fire of Üsküdar in 1921, when the Papelyan household was destroyed, Stepan first moved to the neighboring district of Kadıköy, and then to Pera (now Beyoğlu), where he continued his musical activities. He wrote numerous articles in the Armenian media about literature, art, philosophy and events of the time. He was particularly gifted in explaining difficult subjects in simple and understandable terms. His analysis of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony is of particular interest. Stepan Papelyan died in Istanbul in 1960 and is buried in the Şişli Armenian Cemetery."

  "text" : "J. Shawn Landres (born 1972 in Los Angeles, California) is a social entrepreneur and independent scholar, and local civic leader, known primarily for applied research related to faith-based social innovation and community development. As the co-founder of Jumpstart, a nonprofit philanthropic research organization, he has worked with the White House on Jewish affairs and issues related to faith-based social enterprise. The Jewish Daily Forward named Landres to its annual list of the 50 most influential American Jews in 2009. In 2013-14, Landres chaired the research team and co-authored five of Jumpstart’s six Connected to Give reports, which “map[ped] the landscape of charitable giving by Americans of different faith traditions.” Connected to Give was credited by Indiana University as a “breakthrough finding” distinguishing giving to religious congregations and giving to “religiously identified organizations.” A co-founder (with Rabbi Lawrence A. Hoffman) of Synagogue 3000's Synagogue Studies Institute, Landres is credited with creating the term \"Jewish Emergent,\" which describes new spiritual Jewish communities that have an institutional dynamic in which \"relationship, not contract or program, is the driving metaphor;” the term “Jewish Emergent” reflects similarities in organizing philosophy with a parallel movement in the Christian church. A 2007 report Landres co-authored with sociologist Steven M. Cohen and others linked Jewish Emergent communities to social networking rather than institutional structures. They argued that \"Jewish Emergent\" encompasses both the independent minyan movement (which was supported by Synagogue 3000) and so-called \"rabbi-led emergent\" communities such as IKAR and Kavana Cooperative. In 2006, Landres co-convened the first gathering of Emergent church and \"Jewish Emergent\" leaders in a meeting co-led by theologian Tony Jones, who recounted the episode in one of his books. In 2016, a network of rabbi-led emergent communities established the Jewish Emergent Network, crediting Landres for coining the concept behind its name. In July 2012, the White House invited Landres, representing Jumpstart, to speak as a \"spotlight innovator\" at its Faith-Based Social Innovators Conference. In 2013 Landres was awarded the Liberty Hill Foundation’s NextGen Leadership Award. Landres currently chairs the City of Santa Monica’s Social Services Commission, having previously chaired the Santa Monica Public Library’s Innovation Technology Task Force. He is a commissioner on the Los Angeles County Quality and Productivity Commission and chairs Los Angeles County’s Productivity Investment Board. UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs appointed him as a Civil Society Fellow in 2015. He chairs the board of Impact Hub Los Angeles, part of the global network of co-working centers supporting social entrepreneurship. Landres graduated from Columbia University and received a Masters degrees from Oxford in Social Anthropology and the University of California, Santa Barbara, in Religious Studies, as well as a Doctorate in Religious Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Landres' work on ethnographic methodology has been cited in handbooks for the study of the sociology of religion. In 2004, Landres took a public role in shaping the interreligious response to the film The Passion of the Christ. Bill Clinton has identified him as the \"young man\" who suggested \"Don't Stop\" as the future president's 1992 campaign theme song."

  "text" : "The stoning of Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow was a public execution carried out by the Al-Shabaab militant group on October 27, 2008 in the southern port town of Kismayo, Somalia. Initial reports stated that the victim, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, was a 23-year-old woman found guilty of adultery. However, Duhulow's father and aunt stated that she was 13 years old, under the age of marriage eligibility, and that she was arrested and stoned to death after trying to report that she had been raped. The execution took place in a public stadium attended by about 1,000 bystanders, several of whom attempted to intervene but were shot by the militants. The stoning was condemned by several human rights groups and was cited as being among the first incidents in the civil war in Somalia to be widely reported in the Western media. According to Amnesty International, Al-Shabaab had formally charged Duhulow with adultery despite the fact that convicting a girl her age of adultery would be illegal according to Islamic law."

  "text" : "Stephen of Sawley, also known as Stephen of Easton, was a Cistercian monk, born in Easton, Yorkshire in the late twelfth century, who died in 1252. He had economic ties with the Fountains Abbey and when he decided to enter the monastic life, he withdrew to Fountains and was moulded there in the Cistercian way of life. Stephen held the prestigious office of cellarer at Fountains in around 1215, and in 1223 was chosen by the monks of Sawley, a granddaughter of Fountains (the abbey having been founded in 1147 by Newminster Abbey in Northumberland, itself a foundation of Fountains), to preside as abbot over their community. He held this post for ten years and during this time is known to have attended the annual General Chapter at Cîteaux in 1226 and 1230. In 1234 Stephen left Sawley to take up the abbacy at its mother-house, Newminster, in Northumberland, and remained here until 1247 when he was elected to the abbacy of his former community, Fountains. Stephen presided as abbot of Fountains until his death in September 1252. He died at Fountains’ daughter-house, Vaudey, in Lincolnshire, where he had been conducting an annual visitation of the abbey. He was buried in Vaudey’s chapter-house in front of the abbot’s chair – a privileged and prominent position."

She was considered one of the most talented and versatile actresses in China, and was named one of the 100 best actors of the 100 years of Chinese cinema in 2005. Born Wei Junluo, Shangguan Yunzhu fled to Shanghai when her hometown Jiangyin was attacked by the Japanese. In Shanghai she became a drama and film actress, and her career took off after the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War. She starred in several prominent leftist films such as Spring River Flows East, Crows and Sparrows, and Women Side by Side. After the Communist victory in mainland China in 1949, her career was set back when her husband was embroiled in the anti-capitalist Five-anti Campaign, but she later portrayed a wide variety of characters in many films. Shangguan Yunzhu was married three times and had three children, but all her marriages ended in divorce. She was said to have had an affair with Mao Zedong, for which she was severely persecuted by the followers of Mao's wife Jiang Qing during the Cultural Revolution, leading to her suicide in November 1968."

D. L. LeMahieu's book review in the journal Film & History notes that \"Anderson’s validation of the idiosyncratic and experimental opens new areas of research and analysis for historians.\" Anderson is also known for his contributions to the fields of digital humanities, scholarly electronic publishing, fair use advocacy and technocultural studies. He received his Ph.D. in 2001 from the Film, Literature & Culture program at the University of Southern California under the direction of Professors David James, Marita Sturken and Leo Braudy and an MFA in Film and Video from CalArts in 1990. He was awarded a grant from the HASTAC/MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and Learning competition in 2008 to create the public media archive Critical Commons and in 2014-15 he won a prestigious Digital Innovation Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) to support his project \"Technologies of Cinema: A Critical Digital Archive and Multimodal History of the American Technocultural Imaginary.\""

  "text" : "Sheila White (born 1988) is an African-American abolitionist and a former human trafficking victim from The Bronx, New York City. White grew up in a dysfunctional home and, during her teen years, was placed in foster care, where she was raped. She then underwent a failed suicide attempt and was transferred to a psychiatric hospital. At the age of 15, she was living in a group home, where she was abused by a pimp who forced her into prostitution. While a prostitute, White was battered, raped, and branded with irons. In 2003, she was battered next to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey without anyone even asking her if she needed help. White eventually escaped from being trafficked and went on to work with Girls Educational and Mentoring Services in order to raise awareness on the issue in New York, and President Obama recognized her work by personally giving her an award at the Clinton Global Initiative. She was interviewed in the documentary film Not My Life about her experiences while being trafficked, and said, \"There is a point where you begin to feel numb. You really feel like you're not even a person.\" In 2013, she spoke at the Disrupting Slavery Symposium, the first symposium of the Somaly Mam Foundation, saying that \"we need a platform in which a survivor has the support and comfort needed to become a leader in the field.\" She has three children and attends Bronx Community College, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in social work."

  "text" : "Spartaco Vela (Ligornetto, Ticino, 1853–1895) was an Italian painter, who painted genre, portraits, and landscapes. He was the son of the famous Ticinese sculptor Vincenzo Vela. Spartaco was raised in Turin, but his father, later retired to Ligornetto. His first lessons in design were by his own father, who encouraged him to draw al vero and not copy masterpieces as many of the texts encouraged. Yet as a young man, he enrolled at the Brera Academy at Milan, where his skill was evident the professor Giuseppe Bertini. Other teachers were Eleuterio Pagliano and Mosè Bianchi. However, he was meticulous in producing works, dedicating himself to various esoteric studies. To the National Exposition of Milan he sent a large canvas, canvas, the largest of the exhibition, and it was: Rizpah, the Niobe of the Bible, guardian of the bodies of his sons made to hang by King David."

  "text" : "Sibyl Dunlop (1889 - 20 December 1968) was a British jewellery designer, best known for the jewellery and silver objects in the late Arts and Crafts style that she produced in the 1920s and 1930s. Dunlop was born in Hampstead, London to Scottish parents and finished her schooling in Brussels, where she became interested in jewellery design and underwent some basic training. She established a workshop and shop at 69 Kensington Church Street, London W8, and in the early 1920s was joined by W. Nathanson as her principal craftsman. Dunlop's work is characterised by the use of semi-precious and precious gems, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, moonstone, amethyst, agate, quartz and opals, often cabochon rather than facet-cut gemstones, set in silver in symmetrical patterns, often inspired by nature. One of her most famous designs is the 'Carpet of Gems' symmetrical setting. The gemstones were cut for Dunlop by lapidaries in Germany. Dunlop's work is often confused with that of another female jewellery designer of the same period, Dorrie Nossiter. The business closed at the outbreak of World War 2 in 1939 and Dunlop never returned to work due to ill health. After the war Nathanson re-started the business and continued producing jewellery and silver under Dunlop's name until he retired in 1971."

His election made him the first post-war Italian migrant to be elected to the Parliament of Western Australia. He was re-elected in 1989, but resigned from the Labor Party in 1996, late in his second term, after reading newspaper reports that party figures were suggesting he would retire. He subsequently resigned from the Legislative Council several months short of the conclusion of his term in an unsuccessful attempt to contest the Legislative Assembly seat of Yokine as an independent at the 1996 state election. He returned to politics in 2007 as a councillor and later Deputy Mayor of the Town of Bassendean, and held the latter role until his death."

Toprani, a Republican newcomer running for office in an overwhelmingly Democratic county. At the time, Pettit was being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a grand jury for preferential treatment to friends and political supporters as district attorney, which became an issue in the campaign. Toprani received 65.5 percent of the vote At the time of his election, he was the youngest District Attorney in the state. He was named 40 Under 40 by Pittsburgh Magazine. Following the election, federal agents and state police seized a computer, six boxes of documents and a 4-foot-tall safe from Pettit's offices. Additionally, Toprani found a District Attorney's office that had little technology, which he remedied with a $220,000 federal grant that was used to drug task force and obtaining electronic surveillance equipment. He was generally well-regarded by law enforcement for his efforts. He implemented the first investigating grand jury in county history. His tenure made him known for prosecuting corrupt police officers. In March 2011, he announced a decision not to run for re-election. Following the end of his tenure as District Attorney, he joined the Leech Tishman law firm. In private practice, he was hired by the Pittsburgh Police to review procedures following the resignation of Chief Nathan Harper. He also represented former President of California University of Pennsylvania Angelo Armenti's wrongful termination lawsuit against the university."

  "text" : "Somnath Sapru (born 21 January 1940) is a journalist, editor, media consultant and historian. His books deal primarily with the history of Indian aviation and armed services. The positions he has occupied include editor of The Pioneer and resident editor of the Indian Express. He currently lives in Bangalore. Sapru was born in the princely state of Kashmir (now the state of Jammu and Kashmir) in British India, and educated at Madras University. Over his journalistic career, he has been employed as a defence correspondent with the Deccan Herald, a resident editor of the Indian Express in Madras, and as the editor of The Pioneer. In 1979, while editor of the Pioneer, he received a Jefferson Fellowship. In 1987, he received the Press Foundation of Asia-Mitsubishi Award for \"Asian Journalist of the Year\" (awaiting citation). Since retirement, Sapru has written several books. Skyhawks, published in 2006, is about the four men who were the first Indians to fly military aircraft, while serving in the First World War. According to a reviewer, \"many Indian aviation historians have generally given the topic a wide berth for it was really a time well before the growth of aviation in India and was even further removed from the beginnings of the Indian Air Force\". The book is described as reflecting \"an enormous amount of research ... (where) there was hardly any material or documentation available either in the IAF's archives or the Defence Ministry's records, as this narrative pertains to an era even before the Royal Air Force.\"  Combat Lore: The Indian Air Force, 1930-1945 takes \"the reader through the birth pangs of the Indian Air Force and provides a riveting account of its 'growing-up' years.\""

  "text" : "Samuel Johnston Snr (Born 1840, Drumsara, County Londonderry; died November 10, 1924) was an Australian pioneer, arriving in Victoria, in 1858 from County Londonderry; like so many immigrants of the time he made his way to the gold diggings. Gold mining and industry eventually led him to Queensland, where he proved himself to be a most useful pioneer to whose efforts the state owes the rapid development of previously unsettled and practically unknown portions of her territory. Heading north, he ended up in Rockhampton; which, when in its infancy he owned a sawmill on the Fitzroy River. After a period spent in Rockhampton, he moved further south to the Burnett. In 1867 he purchased a site on the northern banks of the Burnett River to erect his sawmill, which he bought in by the ketch \"Violet\"; the first vessel to enter the river. He is the man responsible for establishing the Waterview Estate. In 1868 the town of Bundaberg was established by the government, no doubt due to the presence of the small settlement, composed of the Stewarts, Watsons, Alexanders and Samuel Johnston. After aiding in pioneering industry with his sawmill, he expanded his operations and pioneered the sugar industry in the Bundaberg district; he established a sugar mill and plantation, again carrying the Waterview name. Many years after beginning in the Burnett region, and after the early settlements had expanded to the far north, he continued to show his enterprise by extending his interests to Port Douglas, becoming the owner of \"Drumsara\" (named after his place of birth), a sugar estate on the Mossman River. He had four sons and eight daughters. Many of whom continued the pioneering Johnston spirit and became integral members of the community from the cape to the central coast."

  "text" : "Samuel Finzi (Bulgarian: Самуел Финци) (born 20 January 1966) is a Bulgarian-German actor, of Bulgarian-Jewish descent, with hundreds of film, television and theatrical credits in a career which, since its start in the late 1980s, has lasted more than 25 years. Between 1993 and 2011, he received ten acting awards. Born in Bulgaria's second-largest city, Plovdiv, he is the son of actor Itzhak Fintzi and performed in his first theater and film roles while still a student. Very early on, he came into contact with directors who have had a major influence on European theater and film. He has worked in the theater with directors such as Benno Besson, Dimiter Gotscheff, Frank Castorf, Jürgen Gosch and Robert Wilson. In film, his collaborations with Michael Glawogger, Oliver Hirschbiegel, Peter Popzlatev, Sönke Wortmann and Til Schweiger have extended his popularity to a wider audience as well as the title role in the crime series Flemming. Alongside his theater engagements at all of the important German language theaters, Samuel Finzi has performed in many film and television productions. Here, he has captivated audiences in popular successes such as ‘Das Wunder von Bern’ (The Miracle of Bern), or Kokowääh, as well as in independent films such as ‘Die Besucherin’ (The Visitor), ‘Même Dieu est venu nous voir’ (Even God Came to See Us) and ‘Vaterspiele’ (Father Games). The actor shapes his figures as smart, associative character studies, which bear witness to a detailed and intelligent acting strategy. Audiences and the press celebrate his intensive images of human motivation that are almost craving for transformation and his effortless precision when performing. In 2014, he has played six leading roles at the Deutsches Theater, the Maxim Gorki Theater and the Volksbühne in Berlin, as well as at the Schauspielhaus in Leipzig."

Gwen Howard served two terms in the Nebraska Legislature, representing the 9th District in midtown Omaha. Because of Nebraska's term-limits law, she was ineligible to run for a third consecutive term in the 2012 election. Sara Howard, who had been her mother's campaign manager, ran for the seat. In the nonpartisan primary, Howard received 56.6% of the vote; Erica Fish, 30.1%; and Vernon Joseph Davis, 13.3%. As the top two vote-getters, Howard, a member of the Democratic Party, and Fish, a Republican, moved on to the general election. Howard won the seat, with 66% of the vote to Fish's 34%. In the Legislature's 2015 session, Howard was appointed to the Banking, Commerce, and Insurance Committee, and to the Health and Human Services Committee."

  "text" : "Syed Wajih Ahmad Naqvi was born at Amroha (UP). Third of seven children of Aziz Fatima and Sibte Mehmood, Naqvi had his early schooling at Amroha (Imamul Madaris Intermediate College) and Bareilly (FR Islamia College) before moving to Lucknow for intermediate and higher education at Shia College and Lucknow University. After obtaining his M.Sc. degree in Physical Chemistry in 1974, Naqvi secured a CSIR Junior Research Fellowship to carry out research at the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa. He has since been working at NIO in various capacities, presently heading the Institute. Naqvi is married to Khamisa Zarreen and has two children, Asad Mehmood and Sumbul Zarreen. Early in his research career, Naqvi was mentored by the late Dr. R. Sen Gupta, under whose guidance he obtained a Ph.D. degree from Poona University in 1987. His research focussed on biologically-mediated chemical transformations in the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the Arabian Sea, which were largely unknown at that time. He provided conclusive evidence for large-scale denitrification (microbial reduction of nitrate to N2 and N2O) in the water column, demarcated its spatial extent and determined its temporal variability. Quantifying denitrification using a variety of innovative techniques, Naqvi showed that the Arabian Sea is the world’s largest oceanic denitrification site, accounting for at least one-third of the global water column denitrification. His results revealed that in contrast with the eastern Pacific, zones of highest primary production and most intense denitrification are geographically separated in the northern Indian Ocean. This decoupling was also shown to be reflected by respiration rates that were found to be maximal within the OMZ, and also too high to be supported by organic matter supplied by particles sinking from the surface layer. These results clearly point to additional modes of organic matter supply, including in situ chemoautotrophic production, within the OMZ. The denitrifying layer was also demonstrated to contain maxima in bacterial abundance and turbidity. Naqvi and colleagues also generated the first comprehensive data set on natural abundance of isotopes in various dissolved nitrogen species from any oceanic area that provided new insights into marine nitrogen cycling. Further, their work showed that, contrary to the prevalent belief, the Arabian Sea OMZ is ventilated surprisingly rapidly (on time scales of a few years at most). These results imply that the Arabian Sea is highly vulnerable to potential anthropogenic perturbations. As a part of the his pioneering efforts to investigate the impacts of global change on marine biogeochemistry of the northern Indian Ocean, Naqvi carried out extensive work on greenhouse gases [carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4)] both in the open-ocean and seasonally-occurring coastal hypoxic zone. The coastal low-oxygen zone, the largest of its kind in the world, has been found to have intensified in recent years, affecting living resources and providing feedback to global change. The former is because denitrification removes all nitrate, at rates that are the highest ever measured from any marine system, culminating in sulphidic conditions, and the latter is due to unprecedented accumulation of N2O. Thus, it has been shown for the first time that human activities are causing an increase in oceanic emissions of N2O, and the efflux of this potent greenhouse gas from the Arabian Sea is globally significant, unlike those of CO2 and CH4. Biological productivity in the ocean is sometimes limited by low concentration of iron. This phenomenon, widely prevalent in the Southern Ocean and equatorial Pacific, has been discovered for the first time in the western Arabian Sea, significantly affecting regional biogeochemistry, including the anomalous location of the OMZ. It has been proposed that addition of iron to the HNLC waters could promote biological production causing a drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Consequently, Ocean Iron Fertilization (OIF) has been widely regarded as a potential technique to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. Naqvi organized the largest OIF experiment conducted so far – called the LOHAFEX - in the Southern Ocean, which yielded quite different results from those of previous studies. In the absence of diatoms, due to silicon deficiency in the study area, intense grazing of smaller phytoplankton by zooplankton prevented large build-up of phytoplankton biomass and carbon export to the deep sea. The LOHAFEX findings imply a much lower than expected potential of OIF for sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Naqvi initiated the first systematic study of freshwater ecosystems of India (groundwaters, natural lakes and man-made reservoirs). Observations in a large number of dams revealed relatively moderate eutrophication, with anoxic conditions prevailing in the lypolimnia during summer stratification with an apparent loss of fixed nitrogen in most reservoirs. Mechanisms and rates of this loss have been determined. More importantly, it has been demonstrated that methane emissions from Indian dams, previously postulated to be the highest in the world, are much smaller. Naqvi provided a nucleus for the formation of a biogeochemistry group in NIO that over the years has developed to be among the best in the world. In this process he also set up numerous state-of-the-art analytical facilities and developed expertise, many of which are not available anywhere in the country. He guided and trained a large number of youngsters who are occupying high positions in academic and research institutions both in India and abroad. He also led numerous research projects. He participated in over 50 research expeditions, being the Chief Scientist of over half of them including LOHAFEX. He was also a member of the Third Indian Expedition to Antarctica that set up the first permanent station at the icy continent.Naqvi has extensively traveled abroad delivering invited talks at a large number of institutions and conferences. He has worked at the following institutions: Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, New York, USA (as a Raman Research Fellow); Institute for Hydrospheric-Atmospheric Sciences, Nagoya University, Japan (as a Visiting Professor); Centre for Tropical Marine Ecology, Bremen, Germany (as a Hanse Wissenschaftskolleg Fellow); and Max-Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Bremen (as a Marie Curie Fellow). He is currently an Adjunct Scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, USA. Naqvi served on a very large number of national and international committees, including United Nations panels and organizing committees of many international conferences. He has been actively involved with planning and implementation of several ocean-related projects of International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and Scientific Committee on Ocean Research (SCOR). He is currently a member of the Executive Committee and several Working Groups of SCOR. He is also engaged in editing of international journals, serving on editorial boards of Marine Biology and Aquatic Biology, and an Editor-in-Chief of Biogeosciences. In recognition of his scientific contributions, Naqvi has received a large number of awards/recognitions including the CSIR Young Scientist Award (1987), MAAS Young Scientist Award (1989), Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar Prize (1996), Vigyan Ratna by the Uttar Pradesh Government (2004), National Award for Ocean Science & Technology by the Government of India (2013), PSN National Award for Excellence in Science & Technology, and HN Siddiquie medal by the Indian Geophusical Union (2014). He is a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India, Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy, and Third World Academy of Sciences."

Due to his large stake in Twitter, both personally and for other investors, he was the subject of media scrutiny at the time of Twitter's IPO; he is notoriously private. Along with social media, Rizvi has invested in telecommunications and entertainment. In April 2007, Rizvi Traverse acquired an equity ownership stake in Summit Entertainment, the studio behind the successful “Twilight” series. In January 2012, Lions Gate announced that it had acquired Summit Entertainment for $412.5 million. In 2005, his firm acquired controlling interest in International Creative Management, but sold its stake. After management problems with the Hollywood talent agency, Rizvi Traverse Management exchanged its equity, \"for a combination of cash, preferred non-voting shares and an ongoing interest in certain assets of the company.\" The firm also helped Hugh Hefner buy back Playboy Enterprises in 2011. In November 2015, the company announced the acquisition of 3D cinema technology firm RealD for $551 million. His father Syied Humayoun Raza Rizvi, who died in July 2016, was a professor of psychology at Ellsworth Community College in Iowa Falls. His brother, Ashraf, is a hedge fund manager."

  "text" : "Samuel St John Topp (13 June 1850 – 1 August 1902) was an Australian barrister who became a leading member of the Victorian legal profession. Topp was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, the youngest son of Samuel Topp, who emigrated to Australia in 1858. Samuel St. J. Topp was brother of Arthur Topp. Topp received his education at King Edward VI.'s Grammar School, Birmingham, and at the Church of England Grammar School, Melbourne (where he arrived in 1861). He subsequently matriculated at the University of Melbourne, where he proceeded to the degrees of LL.M. and B.A. In the Law Course he carried off the third year Law Exhibition and the Law Scholarship in his fourth year, taking first-class honours on each occasion. He wound up his university career by carrying off the Shakespeare Scholarship, the great literary prize of the university. Topp was admitted to the Victorian Bar on 13 September 1877, and acted as law reporter on the Victorian Law Reports for several years. He also contributed some articles on literary subjects to the Melbourne Review in the earlier years of its existence. He has practised his profession ever since his admission to the Bar, and has occupied for some years past a leading position as an advocate in the Equity, Insolvency, and Mining Courts of Victoria.

A renowned Indian educator, playwright and feminist she challenged many stereotypes and traditions in Indian society. She had strong views on the importance of \"joy\" during childhood. She was not in favour of the excessive work-load and homework fetish that continued to dominate the Indian educational scene. She took issue with the prevalent view that girls were at a disadvantage apropos of mathematics and sciences. Darasha maintained that in a nurturing environment where they were not set up to fail in comparison with boys, girls would flourish and blossom. Her creative use of drama in education was an extension of her enduring interest in the stage – as playwright, producer and director. Over the years, Darasha established herself as a distinct and passionate figure in the field of female education in India."

  "text" : "Shane Mortimer (born 24 December 1955) is a Ngambri man with a strong connection to the local Canberra region. Mortimer was born in Belmore, Sydney in 1955 to parents Lesley and Jim Mortimer. Mortimer lived unaware of his aboriginality until 1989, when he discovered a maternal line going back to Ngambri woman Ju Nin Mingo, daughter of James Ainslie. His grandmother Adelaide McClelland had been taken from her mother Florence Ellen Lowe at the Brungle Mission, prior to the First World War. She was one of the thousands of stolen Aboriginal children to be forcibly removed from their parents under legislation that operated in Australia between 1910 and 1970. Mortimer has been living in the Canberra area since the early 1990s. In 2009–10 he co-produced his first feature film, Vulnerable, and he is currently working on a 13-part documentary series on native Australian grasslands. He is also Chairman of the Ag-Arts Residency Kenmore Limited."

  "text" : "Sir Theodosius Edward Allesley Boughton (1760 – 30 August 1780) was the 7th Boughton baronet of Lawford who was poisoned by his brother-in-law in circumstances which made the case famous in its time. At the age of 21, Boughton stood to inherit a fortune, which in the event of his death before that age would pass to his sister. Boughton was confined to his bed by severe illness at Lawford Hall, Little Lawford, near Rugby where his mother and sister, Mrs Donellan wife of Captain John Donellan, were living. He died shortly after taking a draught from the hands of Lady Boughton complaining of the unpleasant taste. After his body was exhumed on a suspicion of poisoning, a Coroner's inquest returned a verdict of murder against Captain Donellan. Captain Donellan, who was known as Diamond Donellan, because of a large diamond he had brought back from India, was tried, condemned and executed on 2 April 1781  for the crime although the evidence against him was solely circumstantial and he died solemnly protesting his innocence. His widow subsequently married Sir Egerton Leigh Bt. The title was inherited by a half cousin, (grandson of the 4th Baronet by his second wife Catherine), Sir Edward Boughton, 8th Baronet, who sold Lawford Hall (later demolished) and the Warwickshire estate in 1793."

  "text" : "Sidney Kennon, known as Mrs. Cannon (died 1754), was an 18th-century British midwife who delivered the babies of royalty and other great families. She collected numerous creatures, curiosities and specimens. Her collections were auctioned after her death and she left a large sum of money to promote the delivery of babies by women rather than men. She was influential in the court of George II and delivered George III in 1738 as a baby for Queen Caroline. Charging up to 50 guineas for a delivery, she became rich. She lived near the court in Jermyn Street, where she entertained celebrities such as Frederick, Prince of Wales. She amassed a large collection of curiosities and objects of natural history. These included polyps and worms, which she studied with the president of the Royal Society, Martin Folkes. Other items included anatomical specimens; coins; medals; ethnographical items; shells; a crocodile given her by royal physician, Richard Mead; and the nightcap of Oliver Cromwell. She died on 11 December 1754 at another residence in Clifford Street in Mayfair. As a dying gift, she presented royal physician Frank Nicholls with a bank note for the considerable sum of £500. This was to support his campaign against the delivery of babies by men. There was some controversy in the 18th century as to whether men should deliver babies. Objections included the indecency and indignity that men might inflict upon women and the damage that instruments such as forceps might do to both mother and child. Nicholls had criticised the practice in his pamphlet, The Petition of the unborn Babes to the Censors of the Royal College of Physicians. Mrs. Cannon's bequests enabled him to continue this work but it was not successful. Her possessions were left to the divine, Arthur Young. Apart from her books about natural history, which were sold privately, the other possessions were sold in public auctions by Abraham Langford. Mrs. Delany wrote that the shells were to fetch £2,500. Horace Walpole bought a large lot at auction which he displayed in his gothic mansion of Strawberry Hill. He wrote about this in a letter to his cousin, Harry Conway, on 12 February 1756: You would laugh if you saw in the midst of what trumpery I am writing. Two porters have just brought home my purchases from Mrs. Kennon the midwife's sale: Brobdignag combs, old broken pots, pans, and pipkins, a lantern of scraped oyster-shells, scimitars, Turkish pipes, Chinese baskets, &c. &c. My servants think my head is turned: I hope not: it is all to be called the personal estate and moveables of my great-great-grandmother, and to be reposited at Strawberry. I believe you think my letter as strange a miscellany as my purchases. P.S. I forgot, that I was outbid for Oliver Cromwell's nightcap."

By 1999 he was the triple cross-country champion for Morocco, had won 2nd place in the Africa Championships and was two-time Arab World Champion. In 2004 during a race in France where he participated under the Moroccan flag, he raised the Saharawi flag above his head during the last few hundred metres of the race. Immediately after that he sought political asylum in France, as this action would likely have led to imprisonment in Morocco. Ameidan was imprisoned for a short period in 2009 after participating in a demonstration in El Aiun. Since 2004 he has been competing with a French team in competitions organized by the French Sport Federations, but as a Sahrawi athlete in international competitions. In 2013 a film, called The Runner, was released about him by the Egyptian/Palestinian/British documentary film maker Saeed Taji Farouky."

  "text" : "Sarah Chepchirchir (born 27 July 1984 in Nandi County) is a Kenyan long-distance runner who competes in road running competitions in distances ranging from 10K runs to the half marathon. She started her professional career by running in races in France. In 2008 she had top three finishes in the Saint-Pol, Auray-Vannes and Le Lion Half Marathons. She made her impact on the scene in 2009, winning the Maroilles 20K and Auray-Vannes Half Marathon. A runner-up finish at the Course Paris-Versailles, a third place at the 20 Kilomètres de Paris, then a personal best of 71:54 minutes at the Reims à Toutes Jambes half marathon cemented her place among the country's top road runners. In the 2010 season she was in the top three at the Corrida de Langueux, Maroilles 20K and Lille Half Marathon – at the latter she ran a personal best time of 69:27 minutes. This helped her earn her first international selection: at the 2010 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships she placed eleventh. She topped the podium at the Auray-Vannes and Boulogne-Billancourt Half Marathons that year. Chepchirchir was in the top two of all her French road races in 2011, including victories at the Le Puy-en-Velay 15K and the Humarathon (where she ran a course record and personal best of 68:07 minutes). In her second international outing for Kenya she placed fifth at the 2011 All-Africa Games half marathon. In 2012 she ran two sub-70-minute half marathons but this was only enough for third in Paris and fifth in Lille. She claimed the course record at the 2013 Paris 20K with a run of 1:05:03 hours, and also won the Ndakaini Marathon in Kenya."

As a result, American librarianship principles, technology and education spread throughout China. Shen Zhurong also co-founded the Boone Library School, the first library science educational institute in his country. It was absorbed into Wuhan University in 1952 and currently exists as the Wuhan University School of Information Management. Shen Zhurong was sent by the American librarian and missionary Mary Elizabeth Wood to study library science in 1914. Upon his return in 1917, he began a tour around China to promote American librarianship. Equipped with film, models and statistical charts, he went to almost every province in China. One of his many contributions was the implementation of the Dewey Decimal System, providing a modern classification scheme to Chinese books."

  "text" : "Reza Kamal (1898 – 11 September 1937), better known by the pseudonym Shahrzad or Scheherazade, was an Iranian dramatist and playwright. He was born in Tehran, Iran. From his childhood he liked One Thousand and One Nights and its storyteller Scheherazade and was to choose Shahrzad as his nickname years later. He studied French language and literature in École Saint-Louis in Tehran. An interest in French literature resulted in his translating some French plays into Persian during those years and then he started to adapt plays, to write some original plays and to direct some of his own plays. Since he lived under a very repressive government with a very restrictive censorship, he usually used historical and mythical characters and stories to talk about his times. An important characteristic of his plays was using female characters as his main characters. He committed suicide on 11 September 1937, the same year as several friends' suicides in what is said to have been a suicide pact."

  "text" : "Sonika Keturah Jermina Mckie (born October 21, 1988), known mononymously as Sonika, is a Grenadian singer-songwriter and recording artist, based in the Eastern Caribbean island of Grenada. Born in St. George's, Grenada, her professional career began when she was approached, by the Manager of Metronome Records, Nima Anvar, who had seen her performance on May 29, 2010 at the Grenada Best Talent Competition Final (an initiative of Wayne \"Waggy T\" Redhead and other local sponsors). Shortly after this, Anvar offered Sonika an opportunity  to be managed by him and to develop her career. During 2011, Sonika accepted the offer. Under Anvar’s management, Sonika was introduced to an organized method for approaching her development as a serious artist. In the process, Anvar pulled in a team of persons to develop Sonika into an international artist. Team members at the inception included local talk show host of Chit Chat and media personality, Lexan Fletcher [originally a co-partner at Metronome Records], who assisted as an image consultant; Annette Moore, who advised on social media strategies and development; Hervin Hood, a Full Sail University Music & Entertainment Business alum, Anvar's then co-partner at Metronome Records who dealt with studio recording, assisted by Joshua \"J-Beatz\" Benjamin, a young sound engineer prodigy; Xpert Productions/Studio, which comprises John James and his brother Jason 'Xpert' James from the neighboring island of Carriacou; Sean \"Fame\" Nelson, a UK-based, Grenadian Music Producer; Samuel Ogilvie, who did the storyboarding for Sonika's music videos and who also assisted with the filming of videos and the video recording of several of her covers; Darryl Friday, a film school graduate, who filmed and edited Sonika’s Gone Away music video, as well as other consultants, who assisted with image development and brand marketing. In 2013, due to pressing responsibilities Anvar handed management over to artist development associate, Annette Moore, who, together with consultant, Mike Adams, continued Sonika's development. Corporate sponsors, including Smiths Grenada [Monica Smith]; Chalene’s Beauty Salon & School of Cosmetology; Jus Fashion Grenada; Lima Es Photography [Salima Esmail]; Solana J. Boutique; Silhouette by Neisha LaTouche; Make-up Artist, Divya Armanani-Noel  and others, all played a role in the image building and professional development of Sonika’s career. To date, Sonika has released five singles between April 2012 and September 2013; she has sung to audiences both locally  and internationally; released a music video for her first single, \"Gone Away\", which went to #1 on Tempo Networks; is the first Grenadian artist to have a VEVO channel and recently filmed and is about to release a music video for \"Please Don’t Let It Go\" (her second single). Sonika is currently working on writing and recording more original singles and clearly defining her sound, style and image."

  "text" : "Stephen, son of Tekesh (Hungarian: Tekes fia István; died after 1280) was a Hungarian distinguished nobleman, who served as voivode of Transylvania in 1280, during the reign of Ladislaus IV of Hungary. His father was Tekesh, son of Nicholas, who served as ispán (comes) of Sáros County for several times. Stephen had two brothers, John and Ladislaus. He had five sons and a daughter from unidentified wife. His name is mentioned by contemporary records since 1267. He supported junior king Stephen at first, however later became a partisan of Béla IV of Hungary, as a result he lost his political influence when Stephen V ascended the throne in 1270. Following the coronation of Ladislaus IV, Stephen was appointed ispán of Bereg County in 1273. He also became head of the Patak ispánate, a royal estate (1273–1282) and master of the chariots (Hungarian: szekérnagy; Latin: maior plaustrorum), holding the latter office until 1275. He served as ispán of Torna County in 1277. The Szádvár Castle, centre of the county was donated by Ladislaus IV to the sons of Tekesh and later confirmed by Andrew III of Hungary. During that time Stephen held the title of \"perpetual count\". Stephen served as ban of Kucsó in 1279. He functioned as voivode of Transylvania for a short time in 1280. Perhaps he was a strong supporter of Finta Aba. Stephen built up a dominant power along with his brothers in North-East Hungary (Torna and Sáros Counties)."

  "text" : "Sir William Talbot, 3rd Baronet (c.1643-1691) was the last of the Talbot baronets of Carton: his title was forfeited on account of his loyalty to King James II of England. He was an Irish politician and judge, who served briefly as Master of the Rolls in Ireland. He was born about 1643, the only son of Sir Robert Talbot, 2nd Baronet of Carton, and Grace Calvert, daughter of George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore. His father was the eldest of eight brothers, of whom the most eminent were Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, and Peter Talbot, Archbishop of Dublin. All three brothers served the Stuart dynasty with notable loyalty during the English Civil War and the Interregnum, and William seems to have inherited his father's loyalty to the Stuarts. He was called to the Bar, succeeded to his father's title in 1670, and for a time acted as Secretary to the Province of Maryland, presumably at the wish of his maternal uncle, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, who was Proprietor of Maryland. The Talbot and Calvert families were devoutly Roman Catholic; William's uncle Archbishop Talbot died in prison in 1680, a victim of the fabricated Popish Plot. Perhaps inspired by his uncle's example Sir William in 1682 made a public plea for religious toleration of Catholics. His open Catholic beliefs, combined with the influence of his uncle Lord Tyrconnell who, as Lord Deputy of Ireland, became for a short time almost all-powerful in Ireland, gained him preferment during the reign of the ardently Catholic King James II. He became a Commissioner of the Revenue in 1682, a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1687 and Master of the Rolls in 1689. He sat in the Patriot Parliament of 1689 as member for Meath. After the downfall of James II Talbot was attainted and his lands and title forfeited. He died at Galway in May 1691. He married in 1683 Anne, widow of Lucas, 6th Viscount Dillon, and daughter of Richard Nugent, 2nd Earl of Westmeath; she died in 1710. They had no children."

  "text" : "Irving Ellis Sanborn (November 28, 1866 – July 18, 1934) was an American sports writer. He was familiarly known as Sy Sanborn. Sanborn was one of the most renowned baseball journalists in the early days of the 20th century. He was featured writer at the Springfield Union News for twelve years, before joining the Chicago Tribune during more than two decades. In addition, Sanborn was one of the organizers of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, being one of the forty-three founding members of that organization established in 1908. Born in Albany, Vermont, Sanborn was the son of Albert J. Sanborn and Caroline C. Stockwell, being a descendant from a line of New England educators. After his father's death he pursued a career as a college professor, as he went through his preliminary schooling at St. Johnsbury and then attended Dartmouth College, where he graduated in 1889, earning an Bachelor of Arts degree and Phi Beta Kappa Society honors. Immediately after his graduation from Dartmouth, Sanborn was assured of a teaching position at a school near to Boston as soon as the fall term began. He then accepted a temporary job in the Springfield Union of Massachusetts, issuing baseball articles and serving as chief editor on all matters pertaining to sports in the newspaper. At this point, he enjoyed the work so well that he stayed with it and decided to specialize in sports journalism. By then, Yale and Harvard universities had selected the city of Springfield as neutral ground for playing their baseball and football matches. Sanborn was assigned to cover these events. After that Springfield entered a baseball team into the original Eastern League, and Sanborn was given the job of reporting the games. Sanborn remained with the Springfield Union for eleven years, in which he covered baseball during the summer and theatrical performances in the winter. During that time he became a close friend of Tom Burns, a versatile infielder and subsequently manager of the Chicago Cubs National League baseball club. Under the guidance of Burns, he turned into one of the brightest and best baseball writers in the business. When the Chicago White Sox were incorporated to the American League in 1901, the Chicago Tribune required to services of another baseball reporter and gave the job to Sanborn. He stayed with the Tribune through 1920. During this stint he also worked on the foundation and development of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, becoming its president in 1919, while serving for several years on commission to select the Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award. Eventually, he was honored with the chairmanship of this commission. Besides his newspaper work, Sanborn served as a freelance writer for several magazines and also contributed as Chicago correspondent for The Sporting News. He moved to Canandaigua, New York after retiring from the Tribune. In 1932, Sanborn spent nearly eleven months in a sanitarium following a long illness. He partly regained his health, though there was a gradual failing and was confined to his home most of the time. Two years later, he committed suicide by gunshot in the garden of his home. He was taken to the hospital in Canandaigua, where he died at the age of 67. Twelve years after his death, Sy Sanborn was one of 12 writers who were honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame on a Roll of Honor in its Class of 1946."

  "text" : "Sydney Howard Gooday (4 September 1887 - 18 July 1964) represented Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, swimming the men's 200-metre breaststroke. Gooday finished third in his first round heat and did not advance. By the time of the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Gooday was residing in Canada. Decades after the Stockholm games during newspaper coverage of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Ottawa journalists stated that Gooday had been the first Ottawa resident to win an Olympic event. Allegedly, Gooday won the 100-metre breaststroke in 1912. However, there is no confirmation of Gooday at the 1912 Olympics. In July 1912, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper includes no mention of Gooday. Canadian George Hodgson was an Olympic swimming star in 1912. The journalists of 1936 were confused. Gooday made many trips from Europe to Canada but none of those voyages coincide with a return from the 1912 Olympics. According to the various passenger lists, Sydney H. Gooday made repeated trips to Canada from England: August 1920 on board the Minnedosa; September 1920 on the Empress of Britain; August 1925 on the Alaunia; and June 1948 on the Ascania. The 1925 voyage included Gooday's wife Marion (age 34) and son Richard (age 6). Gooday's September 1920 voyage was his return from the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. This time Gooday represented Canada, swimming men's 400-metre breaststroke and men's 200-metre breaststroke. On 22 August 1920, Gooday failed to record a time in his 400-metre heat. On 26 August, Gooday finished fifth in his 200-metre heat, failing to advance. Sydney Howard Gooday, son of Henry William and Mary Gooday, was baptised in the parish of Thornton Heath, Surrey, England, 6 November 1887. Sydney was born 4 September 1887. According to the ship's passenger list for the Lake Champlain, Sydney Gooday, draughtsman, unmarried, arrived in Montreal, Canada, from Liverpool, England, 23 October 1911. According to the Civil Service List of Canada, Gooday was first employed as a draughtsman with the Geographer's Branch of the Department of the Interior, 18 November 1912. According to the index material maintained by the archives of the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa, Sydney Howard Gooday married Marion Grant in St George's Anglican Church, Ottawa, in 1917. Their son Richard Sydney Grant Gooday was baptised at St George's in 1919. In addition to his civil service career with the Department of the Interior, Gooday was a swimming instructor for the Ottawa YMCA in the 1930s and late 1920s. The YMCA symbol is included on his burial stone. Sydney's wife Marion Jennie Gooday née Grant (1892-1955) died 29 May 1955 and was buried in Beechwood Cemetery, Ottawa. Gooday died at his Ottawa home on 18 July 1964. According to the newspaper obituary, he was survived by his wife Joyce Sears, son Richard and brother Maurice. Gooday was interred in the Capital Memorial Gardens, Ottawa, Ontario."

Wenxian Zhang, author of an encyclopedia article on Sai Jinhua, wrote that she \"was regarded by some as a cross-cultural courtesan.\" Wan Xianchu, an author of an encyclopedia article on Sai Jinhua, wrote that \"regardless of whether Sai Jinhua's role in China's foreign relations may have been exaggerated and despite the controversies surrounding her conduct and affairs, she lived a tough and spectacular life that has assured her a place in the modern history of China.\""

  "text" : "Sari Dienes (8 October 1898 – 25 May 1992) was a Hungarian-born American artist. During a career spanning six decades she worked in a wide range of media, creating paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, ceramics, textile designs, sets and costumes for theatre and dance, sound-art installations, mixed-media environments, music and performance art. Her large-scale 'Sidewalk Rubbings' of 1953-55 - bold, graphic, geometrical compositions, combining rubbings of manhole covers, subway gratings and other elements of the urban streetscape - signalled a move away from the gestural mark making of Abstract Expressionism towards the indexical appropriation of the environment that would be further developed in Pop art, and exerted a significant influence on Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns."
