  "text" : "Tino Schirinzi (12 August 1934 – 18 August 1993), was an Italian actor and stage director. Born in Taranto, Schirinzi graduated in medicine, then he devoted himself to the theatre, often working at the Teatro Stabile in Turin and at the Piccolo Teatro in Milan. He created a successful artistic partnership with Piera Degli Esposti, and took part in Italian theatrical debut of Patrice Chéreau. After 1968, he was author of irreverent reinterpretations of works by Gabriele d'Annunzio, Carlo Goldoni and of the Elizabethan theatre which resulted in a resounding firing from the Vittoriale theatre. Less active in cinema, in 1983 Schirinzi won a Nastro d'Argento for Best Supporting Actor thanks to his performance in Sciopèn. Struck by an incurable cancer, for which he had lost his speech, in 1993 he killed himself with his wife Daisy Lumini, by jumping from the viaduct under construction on the Bilancino dam near Barberino di Mugello."

  "text" : "Antonio Santiago Rodríguez (born March 9, 1950) — better known as Tony the Marine or as Tony Santiago — is a United States Marine veteran, writer, and military historian from New York City, New York, focused mostly on the military history of Puerto Rico and its service members. For his work, Santiago was recognized by the 23rd Senate of Puerto Rico for being \"one of the main contributors of content related to Puerto Rico in the open online encyclopedia known as Wikipedia\". The Senate also recognized him as one of the main writers on subjects which relate to Puerto Rico, and an important historian of the Puerto Rican military experience. According to Phoebe Ayers, member of the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, this may be the first time that Wikipedia has been mentioned in a parliamentary or congressional resolution of this type. She also stated that it's probably the first time that contributions to Wikipedia have been cited in a formal governmental award, too."

Kanamori was born in 1886 in Aichi Prefecture. He graduated from Tokyo University in 1912 with a degree in Law, and started work for the Ministry of Finance. In 1924, he was appointed as Director of the new Cabinet Legislation Bureau (the first person to hold this post) and he subsequently became Director-General of the Bureau a decade later. He was, however, pressured into resigning only two years later, due to sympathies with the controversial \"Emperor Organ\" theory proposed by Tatsukichi Minobe. Nevertheless, he remained a respected constitutional scholar, who had published several books on the Meiji Constitution. He was consulted on the wording of the new constitution by Toshio Irie His election to the House of Peers in 1946 marked the start of his return to politics. He was elected as Minister of State in the first cabinet of Shigeru Yoshida, and in this capacity argued forcefully in favour of the new postwar constitution. In the course of 114 days of debate, Kanamori responded to over a thousand questions, with extensive responses that took up to one and a half hours. After the implementation of the new legislation, Kanamori helped to form the Kenpō Fukyū Kai (Constitution Popularization Society) in December 1946, and published books and tracts to spread awareness of the new laws throughout the population. In 1948 he became the first librarian of the National Diet Library, a post he held until his death in 1959."

The New Zealand Amateur Athletic Association (NZAAA) selectors recommended three athletes for the 1932 Olympics, but because of the extra cost of a chaperone none were women. The NZAAA decided to nominate her, but as the New Zealand Olympic & Commonwealth Games Association (NZOCGA) only had funds to send three, the fourth would be sent at the expense of the NZAAA. So the Wellington branch of the NZAAA raised £120 for her, although the Otago branch could not raise £50 for Jack Lovelock. In the Olympic semifinals of the 100 m race in Los Angeles she was third after 50 m but dropped back to sixth. She was born in Palmerston North, and moved to Wanganui. She retired from running at 19 in 1933. She married John Irion in 1939, and subsequently lived in Wellington."

  "text" : "Ted Quinn (November 12, 1958, La Porte, Indiana – ) is an American singer/songwriter, musician, record producer, and actor. As Teddy Quinn he was a child actor who appeared in many commercials, films, and television shows of the 1960s and 1970s. Quinn's first appearance was as \"Mike\" in a one-minute television commercial for Bayer Children's Aspirin in 1963. The script extolled the virtues of mothers who care deeply for their children's health. Quinn's final line was – \"Mothers are like that ... yeah, they are\"—and the last three words were an endearing ad lib that caught the public's fancy. One columnist wrote, \"Probably no 'commercial' personality in television history has so completely captured the interest and affection of viewers as little Teddy Quinn, who became famous overnight with the phrase: 'Mothers are like that... yeah they are'... The hundreds of letters the company receives about Teddy Quinn are an excellent indication of the impact of his personality on the public. They come from all over the country and many actually ask that the commercial be repeated.\" The ad also caught the attention of casting agents, leading to his career in Hollywood, including roles in Bonanza, Dr. Kildare, The Virginian, The Courtship of Eddie's Father, Accidental Family and as Scott Baldwin on General Hospital. His motion picture career includes roles in Madame X (1966), The Ghost and Mr. Chicken (1966), The Ballad of Josie (1967), and Necromancy (1972). In 1974 Quinn embarked on a career as a musician. During the 1990s, he was one of the co-founders, with Fred Drake and Dave Catching, of the Rancho De La Luna recording studio in Joshua Tree, California and he continues to collaborate there as a singer, guitarist, and producer. He is a member of the band Rock Art and has released a number of CDs. After several years as a local radio DJ, he is currently DJing at Radio Free Joshua Tree, a live streaming internet station. He also organizes music festivals, and hosts two long-running live music venues: the weekly open mic Reality Show at Pappy & Harriet's in Pioneertown (2007–present) and the Open Jam Super Ruby Tuesday show at the Joshua Tree Saloon (2008–present)."

  "text" : "Thierry Cassuto (born on the 29th of April 1959, in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, in France) is a film and television producer based in Cape Town, South Africa. He studied at Université de la Sorbonne in Paris and at Boston University, where he graduated with a Master of Science in Broadcasting. He is best known as the Executive Producer and co-creator with Zapiro of ZANEWS, the South African web and television satirical news puppet show loosely inspired by the cult British Spitting Image and French Guignols de l'info. Cassuto pitched the idea to South African broadcasters right after moving to South Africa from France in 1998 but kept on hearing that the country was \"not ready\" for satire. In 2008 he managed to convince the SABC to commission a 26 minute pilot but again the public broadcaster's management decided that the \"people were not ready for this\" and quickly banned it.In October 2009, with the help of kulula.com and the Mail & Guardian, Thierry Cassuto and Zapiro finally launched the show online., and in 2011 found a home for their show on television on satellite platform TopTV. He is also the producer of the US adaptation of the show currently in development under the title Puppet Nation USA Before moving to South Africa in 1998, Cassuto founded the arts and entertainment French TV channel Paris Première and participated in the launch of the French terrestrial channel M6 where he started a slate of award-winning magazine programmes including Culture Pub and Capital. With partners Gédéon, he went on to create television production company TVTV (for \"Tout Va Très Vite\"), which was later acquired by AB Groupe. In 2011 Cassuto won a Gold Pixel Bookmark for Best Online Video and was nominated for a SAMA South African Music Awards for the music video of the song \"Chicken to Change\" by South African band Freshlyground, which he directed. He also won six South African Film and Television Awards including Best Director in a TV Comedy and eight DMMA Pixel Bookmarks as part of the ZANEWS team."

  "text" : "Tawata \"George\" Tiloio (Gilbertese: tə'wataː tʕe'loːjo); born c. 1839 — 6 November 1944) was chief of Norauea village on the island of Marakei, Kiribati. He accepted Congregational missionaries into his community in the 1870s  who converted the people of Norauea to the church. Tiloio is famous in Kiribati for the Rawata Pass incident of 1912 where, after conflict with neighbouring Bwainuna village about dowry for a marriage, Tiloio organised his village to obstruct the Rawata Pass with canoes. This led to the lagoon being cut off from the sea and pressure on Bwainuna to satisfy the demands of the bride's family. A canoe from the incident is displayed in the Kiribati National Cultural Centre and Museum. Tiloio died in his village in 1944 during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign of World War II. He rests in the village cemetery along with other past chiefs."

Peopleware's prescriptions had mixed reception, with environmental factors like relative quiet and interrupt protection generally accepted, but other suggestions, particularly the use of enclosed space around a team in preference to open plan seating, largely ignored. The authors' Coding War Games study which supplies evidence for the book's conclusions about the effects of workplace factors on performance is still being cited in articles about workplace design more than 25 years after its initial publication.The term \"Peopleware\" is in general use among software practitioners to describe the extent to which an organization does or not conform to the book's proposed ideals."

  "text" : "Tora Garm-Fex (1890–1973) was a Swedish journalist and writer.She was born 1890 in Vänersborg, Sweden to N. O. Jonzon, Håbol (1852–1922) and Emma Carolina Strömberg (1856–1924) and married 1921 to Filip Fex, Stockholm. She worked as journalist for the following newspapers: \n*  Dagens Nyheter, Sweden 1914–18 \n*  Vecko-Journalen, Sweden 1918–19 \n*  Stockholms Dagblad, Sweden 1919–24 As correspondent she traveled to Russia, Finland, Italy, France, Scotland, Estonia, Germany and in 1923, on a grant, to Iceland.She became a member of the Swedish Publicists' Association in 1916. In early 1918 she traveled to revolutionary Russia and Petrograd under the guise as Salvation Army officer and reported back to Dagens Nyheter in Stockholm. At that time German troops had invaded the West Estonian archipelago and threatened Petrograd with bombardment and invasion. It was merely weeks before the Soviets transferred the government to Moscow. During the course of her assignment she met and interviewed key Bolshevik leaders like Vladimir Lenin, Alexandra Kollontai, Anatoliy Lunacharskiy, Maria Spiridonova and cultural notabilities like the painter Ilya Repin. She also relayed extensive and gritty observations from a street-level Petrograd and, as a consequence, was very nearly killed on several occasions. Later that same year she published a book, \"I bolsjevismens Petrograd\" (Aktiebolaget Ljus' Förlag, Stockholm, 1918), about her Russian journey. A highly dramatic and vivid portrayal of a Russia in transition it is now considered a milestone in early Swedish female foreign correspondence. Tora painted a new picture of the traveling reporter as someone who was capable of leaving comformity behind and face the unknown while at the same time maintaining an aura of the normality the reader was used to and could identify with. At the time this was a novel phenomenon in Swedish travel literature. The book told about a society in disintegration but also about how a reporter could appear while on assignment. Furthermore, it did not reflect any ideological preferences but rather displayed an objective view on history in making. Tora was also active as film critic and chronicler under pseudonyms like \"Masque\", \"Sita\" and \"Rosine\". Post-1924 she left journalism behind and settled down to raise a family. In 1965 she recorded her reminiscences for a programme broadcast on Swedish national radio, Sveriges Radio."

A fast bowler from Buckinghamshire, Helm signed for Middlesex in June 2012 when he was 18. Angus Fraser, Middlesex's Managing Director of Cricket, said of Helm's  2 1⁄2-year contract deal: \"Tom is an exciting young fast bowler and we are delighted to have him on board. He is the fifth local boy we have signed in the past couple of years - Ravi Patel, Adam Rossington, Gurjit Sandhu and Ollie Wilkin are the others - and we hope that, along with these other cricketers, he will play a major role in Middlesex cricket in years to come.” He made his List A debut against Yorkshire in June 2013. In a rain-affected match, he didn't bat and had yet to bowl before the match came to an early end. 3 days later, Helm played his second List A match against Unicorns where he took 3-27."

He was a chorister at Westminster Abbey, and later an alto choral scholar at King's College, Cambridge, under the direction of Sir David Willcocks. He went on to become a lay clerk at New College, Oxford, and later as a schoolteacher for a number of years. In 1979 he succeeded John Rutter as Director of Music at Clare College, Cambridge and Director of Choir of Clare College Cambridge. In his time at Clare he released several acclaimed recordings with the choir (largely on the Naxos label) by composers including Rutter, Vaughan Williams and Stainer. In 1986 he re-founded the Cambridge University Chamber Choir, directing annual performances of all the major Bach and Handel oratorios. He later founded the London-based professional chamber choir, English Voices. Many of his students have gone on to form successful careers in music, notably Norwich Cathedral organist David Dunnett and musician and plant-collector Jeremy Thurlow. He is known as one of the best living choral conductors in the world. He has edited a number of choral volumes for Faber Music and is a contributing editor to the complete edition of music by William Walton, published by Oxford University Press. In 2010, he retired as Director of Music at Clare College, and became Visiting Director of the choir of Robinson College, Cambridge, aiding its meteoric rise in the choral world. In 2011 he founded The Zürich Singing Academy; he now divides his time between Zurich and Cambridge."

  "text" : "Thomas McIlworth (c.1720—c.1769?) was a colonial American portraitist, active mainly in the area around Schenectady, New York. McIlworth was born in Scotland around 1720; his father was the painter Andrew McIlwraith, and his mother Anne was the daughter of portraitist William Mosman. Just when he emigrated is unknown; he is known to have been in New York City by 1757, and advertising his work (as \"Andrew McElworth\") in local papers by 1758. Five years after moving to New York, he left in search of more commissions, settling in Schenectady and painting a number of prominent locals, as well as residents of Albany. He married Anna Statia (or Anastasia) Willet of New Jersey in October, 1760; the pair are believed to have lived in Westchester County for some while, and had a number of children before her death in 1766. McIlworth is said to have been appointed the first Schenectady town clerk in 1765, and is thought to have left the city two years later. He is last recorded in Montreal in 1767, and is believed to have died around 1769, still in Canada. McIlworth's influence has been discerned in the work of another colonial New York painter, John Mare, but the nature of their relationship is unknown."

Harrington has also been a professional designer, illustrator, and fine artist since 1996, creating a range of \"bummer postcards\" and illustrations, including the sleeve art for Les Savy Fav albums.

  "text" : "Thomas de Burley (died c.1371) was an English-born judge and monk in fourteenth century Ireland. He was twice Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Prior of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, whose Dublin house was at Kilmainham. Despite his clerical rank he had a reputation for corruption and vindictiveness. Little is known of his life before 1359, when he was appointed both Prior and Lord Chancellor, except that he was English by birth, and entered the order in England. D'Alton tells us that he was Prior for \"many years\". It has been suggested that he was an unwelcome choice as Prior, but this may simply reflect his later unsavoury reputation. He clashed with many of his judicial colleagues, notably Richard White, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and numerous complaints were made against him for maladministration and corruption. He was superseded as Lord Chancellor in 1364, after the Irish House of Commons sent a powerful delegation, including White and Maurice Fitzgerald, 4th Earl of Kildare, to England to complain of his misconduct; the precise complaint being that he had seriously misrepresented to King Edward III the state of affairs in Ireland. It is interesting that the King gave an order that the delegation should not be \"troubled\" for their mission on their return to Ireland, indicating that they were afraid of reprisals from Burley or his allies, which in turn suggests that Burley had a name for being vindictive. He was also preceptor of the Order's house in Shropshire. In 1367 it was proposed to reappoint him Lord Chancellor in place of the quarrelsome and unpopular Thomas le Reve, Bishop of Lismore and Waterford. A brief power struggle developed, from which Burley emerged the victor. The same year he complained that the Order's manor at Leixlip was being wrongfully distrained for debts it did not owe. In 1367-8 the Bermingham family and their retainers began a private war in County Meath. Burley was appointed to negotiate a treaty with them, together with John Fitzrichard, High Sheriff of Meath, and Robert Tyrrel, Baron of Castleknock. A parley was arranged at Carbury but the Berminghams in breach of the agreed terms took the commissioners captive. Burley was quickly released in exchange for James Bermingham, then a prisoner in Trim Castle; the others were required to pay a ransom. He does not seem to have been ill-treated. He probably died in 1371, when William Tany succeeded him as Prior."

Toru grew up in the mountains of rural Yamagata. He completed his early schooling in Yamagata and later finished his education in Tokyo. He has lived in Russia and France. In 1969, Oba moved to La Roque-sur-Cèze, France. He apprenticed with French stonemasons working on the 11th century stone village. He lived in France with his wife and daughter until 1972. Then he moved to rural West Virginia, United States, where he created Japanese style gardens, Russian, Finnish and Rumford style fireplaces. In 1984, Toru became an instructor of a stone masonry workshop at the Lama Foundation in Taos, New Mexico. Oba subsequently became a founding member of the \"The Stone Foundation\" based in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 1985, Oba moved with his wife and two daughters, to central Virginia, where he currently resides. Toru's work evolved towards landscape features and monumental sculptural structures such as Japanese style lakes, waterfalls, massive sculpted stone benches, tables, and freestanding contemporary sculpture. \"Toru's stone work is always art\".Oba's style is \"rough surfaces juxtaposed against smooth ones, wide-open spaces, and nature-like arrangements– betrays a very Japanese aesthetic\". Currently Oba has six monumental sculptures prominently displayed in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia at the McGuffey Art Center and has worked at 531 N. First St in the same town. Oba's work is on display at the Brad Smith Gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico and in private collections around the world."

  "text" : "Tom Bernard is an American film distributor specializing in art cinema and is one of the co-founders of Sony Pictures Classics (SPC). An alumnus of the University of Maryland, Bernard became notable as head of sales at United Artists Classics (1981–1983) where he first worked with long-time collaborator Michael Barker. Bernard and Barker left UA to create Orion Classics in February 1983. They attended the Cannes Film Festival hoping to buy their first title and picked up Eric Rohmer's Pauline at the Beach when they were \"in a desperate position\". Looking back 30 years later, Bernard (who still has a full head of hair) remembered \"lots of big, fat, bald guys\" in 1983 but now the class of people is \"very, very different\", \"the only thing you can say is the same is they always have the best movies.\""

  "text" : "Sir Thomas Foxley (c.1305 – 1360) was MP for Berkshire several times in the 14th century, and Constable of Windsor Castle, also in the English county of Berkshire, from 1328 to his death. His father, Sir John Foxley (c.1270 - c.1325) was a Baron of the Exchequer who held lands in Bray, Berkshire. His mother, Constance de Bramshill (d.1333), may have been the heiress of the De Bramshill family from Bramshill in Hampshire. Thomas was probably born in Bray. He became MP for Berkshire in 1325, and was appointed constable of Windsor Castle in 1328, soon after the accession of the 14-year-old Edward III. He retained the office until his death. He was responsible for rebuilding the castle for Edward III. Foxley was also the builder of a castle at Bramshill that became the core of the later Bramshill House."

  "text" : "Thomas Laxton (1830–1893) was a plant breeder and a correspondent of Charles Darwin, best known for his hybridisation of peas. Thomas Laxton was born in the village of Tinwell, Rutland in 1830. He practised as a solicitor in Stamford before his interest in horticulture led him to become an authority on plant hybridisation. By 1858 Laxton was breeding plants. initially he worked from St Mary's Hill, Stamford and corresponded with Charles Darwin from this address. Early correspondence with Darwin referred to Laxton's work on hybridising peas. Laxton applied scientific methods to plant breeding, making careful observations of parent plants. Laxton recognised the susceptibility of plants to disease and resistance of these diseases by their American counterparts. Laxton made observations on gooseberries and Darwin corresponded with him during the 1860s and 1870s on his work. Laxton is probably widely remembered for his contribution to strawberry breeding. In 1872 Laxton began to introduce strawberry varieties from his plant breeding work. Laxton moved the business to Bedford in 1879 and in 1885 Kelly’s directory identifies him as a ‘seed grower and merchant’ listed at 1 Harpur Place Bedford. In 1884 Laxton introduced his first major strawberry success 'Noble' a chance seedling of 'Excelsior' and 'American Sharpless'. Followed by 'King of the Earlies' in 1888. These two varieties formed the parentage of Laxton’s 'Royal Sovereign' in 1892. Laxton married twice with three daughters from his first marriage and four sons from his second marriage. Two sons William and Edward went into partnership to form Laxton Brothers in 1888. Thomas Laxton died in August 1893. The brothers recognised their father's horticultural contribution by introducing the pea 'Thomas Laxton' in his honour in 1898."

  "text" : "Torkild Rieber (March 13, 1882 – August 10, 1968) was a Norwegian immigrant to the United States who became chairman of the Texas Company (Texaco). Born in a small town in Norway, Rieber became a seaman at the age of 15. By 1904 he was the master of an oil tanker, which was bought the next year by the newly founded Texas Company, or Texaco. He rose steadily through the ranks to become chairman in 1935. The next year he arranged for Texaco to buy the Barco oil concession in Colombia. Over the next three years he oversaw the major engineering feat of opening the remote oilfield and building a pipeline through rugged and jungle-covered terrain to the Caribbean coast. Rieber was sympathetic to the Fascist regimes in Europe in the 1930s, and supplied oil on credit to Franco's forces during the Spanish Civil War. He also purchased tankers from Germany in exchange for oil. The last tanker was delivered from Hamburg after the outbreak of World War II. For a while Texaco continued to ship oil to Germany via South America. When Rieber's ties to the Nazis were revealed in August 1940 there was a scandal and he was forced to resign. Rieber continued in the oil industry. After Iran nationalized British oil holdings in 1951, followed by a western-sponsored coup in 1953 that restored the Shah to power, Rieber helped negotiate a settlement of the oil dispute."

  "text" : "Tony Naughton (16 February 1952 – 16 July 2013) was a British/Australian financial economist who was the head of the School of Economics, Finance and Marketing at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) for over ten years immediately prior to his untimely death in July 2013. He was known for his research into finance and corporate governance and for his contribution to raising the research profile of the School of Economics, Finance and Marketing at RMIT. He was also known for the successful mentoring of a large number of students and colleagues who, as a result, climbed to the top of the academic ladder. At the core of his research was the behaviour of security prices, which was subsequently extended to cover corporate governance explanations of firm performance, the stock returns of initial public offerings and trading strategies. Much of the empirical work he did pertained to the emerging markets of Asia, particularly China. In recent times he was involved in two major projects, the first of which was to examine the impact of stock market reforms in China, whereas the second was about developing and testing a new instrument to examine behavioural biases in investor decision-making."

  "text" : "Tzeporah Berman (born February 5, 1969) is a Canadian environmental activist, campaigner and writer. She is known for her role as one of the organizers of the logging blockades in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia in 1992–93. The protest against the logging of the temperate rainforest was, at the time, the largest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history. Working with Greenpeace, Berman has helped bring the clearcut logging of Canada's rainforest to international prominence. She has worked on the Great Bear Rainforest campaign, and the Boreal campaign. She is a strategic advisor on clean energy, oilsands and pipelines for many environmental, First Nations and philanthropic organizations. She has been co-director of Greenpeace International's Global Climate and Energy Program, Executive Director and Co-founder of PowerUp Canada and Co-founder and Campaign Director of ForestEthics. In 2009, Berman served on British Columbia’s Green Energy Task Force. The task force, appointed by Premier Gordon Campbell, was charged with making recommendations on the development of renewable energy for the province. Berman was one of the experts in the environmental documentary The 11th Hour, produced by Leonardo DiCaprio. She was named as one of six Canadian nominees for the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship social entrepreneur of the year award, one of \"50 Visionaries Changing the World\" in Utne Reader and as \"Canada's Queen of Green\" in a cover story by Readers Digest. She was included in the Royal British Columbia Museum permanent exhibit of “150 people who have changed the face of British Columbia.” In 2015 Berman served on the British Columbia Governments Climate Leadership Team and was appointed in 2016 to serve on the Alberta Governments Oil Sands Advisory Group as Co-Chair. Berman was listed of one of the 35 Most Influential Women in British Columbia by BC Business Magazine and awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Law from University of British Columbia."

  "text" : "Tim Crouch (born 1964) is an experimental theatre maker: an actor, writer and director. His plays include My Arm, An Oak Tree, ENGLAND and The Author. These take various forms, but all reject theatrical conventions, especially realism, and invite the audience to help create the work. Interviewed in 2007, Crouch said, ‘Theatre in its purest form is a conceptual artform. It doesn’t need sets, costumes and props, but exists inside an audience’s head.’ Stephen Bottoms, Professor of Contemporary Theatre & Performance at the University of Manchester, has written that Crouch's plays 'make up one of the most important bodies of English-language playwriting to have emerged so far in the twenty-first century....I can think of no other contemporary playwright who has asked such a compelling set of questions about theatrical form, narrative content and spectatorial engagement.' Holly Williams, writing in The Independent in June 2014, says, 'Crouch has built a name for himself as one of British drama’s great innovators, with plays that have disturbed and challenged the passive theatrical experience.'"

Were impeachment approved, Hill would, upon conviction in the Wyoming Senate, be required to vacate her position. No deadline has been set for the committee to complete its work."

  "text" : "Thomas Sutton (1767–1835), a physician in Kent, England, was the first to publish a description of delirium tremens (the \"DTs\") and to connect the illness to an over indulgence in alcohol. Sutton was born in Staffordshire, England about 1767. He studied medicine in London, England, Edinburgh, Scotland, and Leiden, The Netherlands, which granted him an M.D. in 1787. He became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1790. He served in the Army and then settled in Greenwich, England to become a consultant at the Kent Dispensary and to practice medicine. In 1813, Sutton published his book, Tracts on Delirium Tremens, on Peritonitis, and on Some other Internal Inflammatory Affections, and on the Gout. The chapter on delirium tremens contains sixteen case-reports with detailed description of the symptoms and the differential diagnosis from “phrenitis” (another term for delirium) due to inflammation of the brain and from mania. He described the unusual case of a woman not known to be inebriated but he discovered that she frequently imbibed large quantities of Tincture of Lavender, which has an alcohol base. Sutton’s treatment for delirium tremens discarded the use of bleeding, an accepted medical method unless the patient was plethoric. Instead, he used opium in sufficient dosage to induce sleep from which the patient awoke improved. He suggested purgation if needed noting that opium may cause a confined bowel state and that blistering appeared to be of no use. Sutton died at Greenwich in 1835."

Belizaire covered some of the most important stories in Haiti over the past three decades, including the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He earned numerous awards for journalism and photography. Belizaire was born on March 30, 1955. A photographer, Belizaire joined the staff of AFP in May 1987 as a photojournalist. In 2013, Belizaire began work on photo essays that explored environment of Haiti, as well as photographs of potential development needed to improve the quality of life for the average Haitian. In addition to his work with AFP, Belizaire founded the Union of Haitian Journalists and Photographers (UJPH). He was also a contributor to Radio Kiskeya. Belizaire, who had fought oral cancer, died from complications of respiratory difficulties at the Canapé Vert hospital in Pétionville, a suburb of Port-au-Prince, on July 21, 2013, at the age of 54. He had still been reporting as recently as July 19, when he covered a local protest against the legalization of same-sex marriage. He was survived by his wife, Marie-Florence, and three children - Jeremie, Jonathan and Jovanny. Prime Minister of Haiti Laurent Lamothe called Belizaire an \"outstanding professional\" noting that \"Mr. Belizaire devoted more than 30 years of his life to covering the major social, political and cultural events in the life of the Haitian people.\" The regional director of AFP for North America, David Millikin, also paid tribute to his life, \"Thony was a gentle but very courageous man -- not only for ignoring personal risk while covering the momentous events which marked Haiti's recent history, but also for pursuing his career with passion and diligence despite battling serious health issues in recent years.\" In August 2015 Seven Stories Press will publish Thony Belizaire, Witness to History, a collection of one hundred full-color images with accompanying text the author was writing for this book right up to his untimely death."

In 2009, Wall competed at the World Juggling Federation's \"Winter Blitz\" event. No judge had seen any of his creative five-ball tricks performed before, so his routine was deemed unscoreable. In 2014, Thom competed at the International Jugglers' Association (IJA) Senior Stage Championships with a traditional mouthstick juggling act. This act was awarded the bronze medal, making it the first time the discipline has been awarded a competition medal in the championships' 67-year history. Thom was hired by Cirque du Soleil in April 2014 to replace juggler Greg Kennedy in the show Totem."

Oxford Dictionary of Dance called him one of the greatest character dancers. Timofei Stukolkin came from a very poor family. In 7 years he played in a pantomime on a fairground. Someone once drew attention to the talented boy and brought him into the theatre school at the Imperial theaters of Petersburg. In 1836 Timofei Stukolkin was accepted at the ballet department of Imperial theatre college. His teachers were French dancers working in Russia: Emile Gredlu (ru: Эмиль Гредлю), Pierre Frédéric Malavergne, Charles La Chuque (ru: Шарль Лашук) and Jean-Antoine Petipa. He graduated in 1848 and was accepted by the Imperial troupe of St. Petersburg. He showed the talent of the psychological and grotesque roles. In addition to the ballet performances he often appeared in dramatic roles - comedies and farces. He always enjoyed great success. He wrote for himself short humorous monologues and often played them in concerts, simultaneously with dancing. Timofei Stukolkin was one of the most beloved actors of Saint-Petersburg. Since 1854, continuing artistic activities at the St Petersburg Imperial troupe, he began to teach the dances in different schools. Among his ballet roles: \n*  Peter — Faust, choreography by Jules Perrot  \n*  1858 — A Marriage During the Regency \n*  1858 — Bertram — Robert and Bertram \n*  1859 — Marquis Megrèle — The Parisian Market or Le Marché des Innocents \n*  1860 — Ignas — Pâquerette \n*  1860 — Beausoleil — The Blue Dahlia \n*  1863 — Beshir — The Beauty of Lebanon or The Mountain Spirit \n*  1862 — John Bull — The Pharaoh's Daughter \n*  1864 or 1865 — Rinaldo — The Traveling Dancer (to benefit of Nikolay Goltz (ru: Николай Осипович Гольц)) \n*  1866 — Taras — Le Poisson doré \n*  1867 — Mephistophelis — Faust, revival by Marius Petipa (choreography by Jules Perrot) \n*  Nikez (Alain) and Marceline (Widow Simone) — La fille mal gardée \n*  1871 — Don Quixote — Don Quixote \n*  1872 — Comte de Melun — Camargo \n*  after 1865 — Ivanushka — The Little Humpbacked Hors (because of a broken leg was replaced by Nilolay Troitsky) \n*  1884 — Dr Coppelius — Coppélia \n*  1892 — Drosselmeyer — The Nutcracker Timofei Stukolkin began to write memoirs at the end of life. He wrote about the theater life, about the student's, about a very hard life of children in the theater school. These memoirs were published shortly in 1895 after his death. Timofei Stukolkin died suddenly of a heart attack after the second act of the ballet Coppélia. Dancers quickly finished third act without him."

He styled himself as Shouzhi (守之), Xin’an (心庵), and Ziyang hermit (紫陽山人).Due to his premature death, the loss of his biography and epitaph, and the fact that much of his early life was not documented, scholars have been unable put together a detailed summary of his life."

  "text" : "Tom Christian MBE was a citizen of Pitcairn Island, who was its long-serving radio operator.During his lifetime Christian was profiled in a number of publications, including National Geographic magazine and People magazine. Christian served as the Governor's appointee on the Pitcairn council for forty years.In 1983 Christian had been appointed a member of the Order of the British Empire, an order of chivalry. Christian left the island for New Zealand, when he was 17, for three years, where he was trained to operate radio station ZBP, first set up by the New Zealand military during World War II.In 1989, according to People magazine, Christian was the highest paid Islander, earning $10,000. The Telegraph reported that Christian had spent other relatively brief periods off-island, that he had always been attracted to life off-island, and never expected to stay on the island so long.Christian, like most Pitcairn Islanders, was a follower of Seventh-day Adventism, and worked for six months at a Seventh-day Adventist radio station in California. He also made several cruises as a radio operator on a freighter vessel. In later years Christian visited the outside world where he delivered lectures on Pitcairn and its history. In his New York Times obituary Christian was described as one of the HAM Radio world's two most sought after operators. Christian, as the island's radio operator, with call sign VP6TC/VR6TC, served as \"the voice of Pitcairn\" from the mid-1950s to his retirement in 2004. His radio hut was atop spyglass hill, which, at 870 feet (270 m) elevation, is the highest point on the island. He was awarded an MBE in 1983. According to his New York Times obituary Christian and his wife Betty Christian took a firm stand during the Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 against the idea that Polynesian people had different standards about the sexual initiation of minors. Christian died of the after-effects of a stroke. He and Betty had four daughters, Darilene, Sherilene, Jacqueline, Raelene, and six grandchildren. According to the HAM radio association he had been diagnosed as suffering from Alzheimer's disease in 2009, and his health and awareness of his surroundings had steadily deteriorated since then. His daughters Jacqueline and Raelene are also HAM radio operators."

He is also known for his Diplom thesis presenting one of the first public implementations of a telephone with built-in voice encryption, the \"Cryptophon\". Floricic's pseudonym was a reference to the eponymous character in the 1982 Disney film Tron. Floricic was interested in defeating computer security mechanisms; amongst other hacks, he broke the security of the German phonecard and produced working clones. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 months in jail for the physical theft of a public phone (for reverse engineering purposes) but the sentence was suspended to probation. From December 2005 to January 2006, media attention was drawn to Floricic when his parents and Andy Müller-Maguhn brought legal action in Germany against the Wikimedia Foundation and its German chapter Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. The first preliminary injunction tried to stop Wikipedia from publishing Floricic's full name, and a second one followed, temporarily preventing the use of the German Internet domain wikipedia.de as a redirect address to the German Wikipedia."

  "text" : "Thomas Ingham Joynt KC (December 1830 – 5 September 1907) was a senior member of the New Zealand legal profession from Christchurch. Born in Ireland, he emigrated to Canterbury with his wife and child in 1856. He had commenced legal training in Dublin and was admitted to the bar in 1863 in Christchurch; at the same time, he set up his own legal firm. Over the years, he formed various partnerships with other solicitors. Joynt became known as a defence lawyer and had many high-profile cases, but he was equally successful in civil cases. In 1907, when the first ten King's Counsel were appointed in New Zealand, Joynt was acknowledged as the senior member of the bar. He practised until shortly before his death. He represented Kaiapoi on the Canterbury Provincial Council from 1871 until the abolition of provincial government some five years later. He served on the Canterbury Executive Council as Provincial Solicitor for 15 months under William Montgomery. He unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in 1884 election and this marked the end of his political ambitions."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Toh.) Toh Aik Choon was born in the Malayan seaport of Penang in 1927. He was the youngest child in a family of three, he had an elder brother who was killed in the Second World War, and an elder sister. A.C. attended the Chung Ling High School in Penang before his education was disrupted by the Second World War. He worked for the Sim Lim Trading Co. in Penang, before transferring to the Singapore head office in 1952, after his marriage to Khoo Lay Kee. By 1962, Aik Choon had become Managing Director of Sim Lim Co. Ltd, which was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Aik Choon was instrumental in many of the joint venture industrial enterprises that Sim Lim commenced in that period. In particular, he was Director of Malayan Shipbreakers Ltd. 1961(Singapore's first ship-breaking company), Chairman of Pan Malaysia Paint Industry Ltd (1962–65), and a founding director of Nippon Paint (S) Co. Pte Ltd (1965–75), National Iron and Steel Mills Ltd (1964), Malayan Iron and Steel Mills Ltd (1968), Decola (S) Ltd, and Director of Sim Lim Investments Ltd (n.k.a Pacific Century Regional Development Limited). Aik Choon left Sim Lim in 1969 to start his own company, A.C.T. Enterprises Pte Ltd, which became a holding company for various joint ventures he started. Capitalizing on the first wave of Japanese investment into South East Asia in the 1970s, he started numerous manufacturing and trading joint ventures during this period, including Fujitec Singapore Corporation Ltd, Hitachi (Singapore) Pte Ltd, Hitachi Consumer Products (S) Pte Ltd, Nissei Sangyo (S) Pte Ltd, Hitachi Consumer Products (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, Hitachi Cable (S) Pte Ltd, and Toyo Metal Products (S) Pte Ltd. He was also an early investor in the US real estate market, where he started developing industrial land in Dekalb County, Georgia, through the Atlanta International Industrial Park. In 1987 he started A.C.T. Investments, Inc. together with Peter E. Chang. The company’s first project was the development of the 36 storey luxury apartments, the Grandview in Buckhead, Atlanta. In joint venture with China Travel Services, A.C. Toh started CTS' first US headquarters in Atlanta in 1988. The Atlanta office started organizing group tours from continental USA to China in 1989 In the early 80s, Aik Choon was energized by the potential of the China market, and worked relentlessly to bring foreign investors and consultants to the People’s Republic of China. In 1984, he started the Tianjin International Technology Consulting Centre (ITC) in Tianjin, in collaboration with the Science and Technology Commission. ITC became the first sino-foreign joint venture consulting company, with a no-dividend policy for 50 years. He became an honorary citizen of Atlanta and the State of Georgia, and was posthumously awarded honorary citizenship of the City of Tianjin, and the prestigious Friendship Award by the State Department of the People’s Republic of China. A.C. Toh died in September 1990, age 63, survived by his wife and three children, Serene, Merlene and James."

In 1358 he was exempted from the usual feudal duties of a landowner. He was sent to Ireland in 1361, in the entourage of Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; he remained in Ireland, apart from a few short intervals, until 1369. He was made Lord Chief Justice in 1365, and was also described as \"Governor\"; he became Custos Rotulorum of Ireland in 1366. He died in 1373. His son, also Sir Thomas de la Dale (died 1396), was a senior member of the household of Lionel's younger brother, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster; he sometimes went by the alternative surname Fulthorpe, and was described as \"a man of substance\". Fulthorpe was succeeded by his son, yet another Thomas de la Dale. The de la Dales owned Barford until the male line of the family died out in the sixteenth century. The last of the Dales, Anne, married Alexander Fettiplace in 1537."

  "text" : "Thomas Stephens, , FGS, (4 October 1830 – 25 November 1913) was an Australian educationist. Stephens was second son of the Rev. William Stephens, B.A., vicar of Levens, Westmoreland, England. The family came originally from the South of England, but a branch of it was settled for many years in County Cavan, Ireland, where they held considerable landed property. Mr. Stephens' grandfather was vicar of Castletown, Delvin, co. Westmeath. His father migrated to England, after being ordained, and remained, until his death in 1864, in charge of the Westmoreland parish. Thomas Stephens was born at Levens, Westmorland in 1830, received his education at Marlborough College, proceeding thence to Oxford in 1850. Here he entered first at The Queen's College, Oxford, where his elder brother, Professor William Stephens, of the University of Sydney, was afterwards Fellow and Tutor; but subsequently obtained a scholarship at Magdalen Hall, now Hertford College. In 1854, he took his B.A. degree, and ten years later received that of M.A. In 1855 Stephens emigrated to Victoria (Australia), intending to follow pastoral pursuits, but was attracted to Tasmania in the following year, and in 1857 accepted the appointment of Inspector of Schools under the Northern Board of Education. On the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern Boards in 1863 he was appointed Inspector of Schools for the Colony, a title subsequently altered to Chief Inspector of Schools. While occupying this position, Stephens had a large and important share in the organisation of the system of primary education, and was the first to introduce a standard of instruction for the schools, and a scheme of classification for teachers. On the passing of the Education Act in 1885, which placed the Department under the direct control of a Minister of the Crown, the offices of Chief Inspector and Secretary were amalgamated, and Stephens was appointed permanent head, with the title of Director of Education. In the years 1861–62, he was an active member of the Northern Board of Works, under whose direction the principal lines of road through the then little known North-Eastern and North-Western districts were planned and commenced. Stephens was the author of a number of papers, chiefly on geological subjects, contributed to the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania, of which Society he was one of the Vice-Presidents. He was a Fellow of the Geological Society of London, and a member of the Council of the University of Tasmania. Stephens died in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia on 25 November 1913."

He had his first solo exhibition in Paris in 1984, and a long association with the band Duran Duran, producing illustrations for the Duran Duran spin-off art rock band, Arcadia's album So Red The Rose. Viramonte died in 1988 at the age of 28 of AIDS. Bold, Beautiful and Damned: The World of Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes was published in 2013.

  "text" : "Thomas Dowdall or Dowedall (died c.1492) was an Irish barrister and judge who held office as Master of the Rolls in Ireland. He was born in County Louth, son of Sir Robert Dowdall, who was for many years Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, and his wife Anne Wogan. The Dowdall or Dovedale family came to Ireland from Dovedale in Derbyshire in the thirteenth century. Sir Thomas Dowdall, who married Elizabeth Holywood of Artane, widow of the third Baron Delvin, about 1450, was probably a close relative. Elizabeth's third husband was Peter Trevers, Dowdall's predecessor as Master of the Rolls, an example of how small the world of the Anglo-Irish ruling class was in that era. He was studying law at Lincoln's Inn in 1459. He returned to Ireland and was made Serjeant-at-law (Ireland) in 1462: he was confirmed in office by Parliament in December 1469. In 1471 he was described as a \"counter\" (this was probably an office in the Exchequer of Ireland) and later that year he was appointed Master of the Rolls. He was summoned to England on official business in 1479. Like the great majority of the Anglo-Irish gentry, which included all the High Court judges, he made the mistake of supporting the claims of the pretender Lambert Simnel in 1487 to be the rightful King of England. Simnel's cause was crushed at the Battle of Stoke Field. The victorious King Henry VII was prepared to be magnanimous to the defeated rebels and Dowdall and his judicial colleagues received a royal pardon. He probably died in 1492. James Dowdall, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland 1583-4, was a descendant of Thomas."

  "text" : "Anthony David Bradshaw FRS (17 January 1926 - 21 August 2008) was a British evolutionary ecologist He was born the son of an architect in Kew, Surrey and educated at St Pauls School, Hammersmith. He read Botany at Jesus College, Cambridge and in 1947 moved to the University College of Wales, first as a research student in Aberystwyth and then as a lecturer in the Department ofAgricultural Botany at Bangor. There he worked on the adaptation of plants to heavy metal pollution, demonstrating the ability of natural selection to bring about rapid evolutionary changes in natural grasses, even in very localised situations. In 1958 he accepted the Chair of Botany at the University of Liverpool where he pioneered novel ideas of restoration ecology to help recover polluted sites without the need to cover them in imported topsoil. His work on the revegetation of china clay tips in Cornwall formed the basis of the techniques behind the Eden Project. In 1982 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was President of the British Ecological Society for 1982–83 and the Inaugural President of the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management in 1991–94. In 1991 he delivered the Croonian Lecture to the Royal Society on Genostasis and the limits to Evolution. He married Betty Allison and had 3 daughters."

He was incarcerated in Stavern for some time, then from December 1943 he was incarcerated in Sennheim and Buchenwald until the war's end. He finally graduated with the cand.mag. degree in 1948, and spent three years in the Ministry of Social Affairs before he was hired in the cultural department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He became press attaché in the United States in 1959, later in West Germany. He was also an embassy counsellor in London before returning home as assistant secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1970. He was promoted to sub-director in 1973. Anda then served as an ambassador, first to PR China from 1975 to 1979, then to Canada from 1979 to 1984 and Israel from 1984 to 1989. Soon after retiring he released the book Intifada – opprør mot Israel, describing his personal views on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He criticized Israel over responsibility for the human rights violations in the region. Already towards the end of his ambassador tenure he had compared the situation to the German occupation of Norway. He also served as a member of the city council in Mandal, where he had bought a cabin in Skjernøysund in 1963. He resided at Jar during his diplomatic career, but moved to Mandal upon his retirement. He was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav. He died in September 2013, aged 92."

  "text" : "Thomas Craig was a professor at Johns Hopkins University and a proponent of the methods of differential geometry. Thomas Craig was born December 20, 1855, in Pittston, Pennsylvania. His father Alexander Craig immigrated from Scotland, and worked as an engineer in the mining industry. Thomas Craig first studied civil engineering at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, where a teacher William J. Bruce was a mentor to him. Thomas took his C.E. degree in 1875. He taught high school in Newton, New Jersey while continuing to study mathematics. He entered into correspondence with Benjamin Peirce and Peter Guthrie Tait. Thomas Craig was one of the prime movers of Johns Hopkins University when it was launched by Daniel Coit Gilman in 1876. Craig and George Bruce Halsted were the first Hopkins Fellows in mathematics. James Joseph Sylvester had been invited to lead a graduate program in mathematics but would only be doing that. Craig was needed to teach differential calculus and integral calculus.The first year there were only fifteen students studying mathematics, but by 1883 there were 35. In 1879 Craig took his Ph.D. degree with a dissertation \"The representation of one surface upon another, and some points in the history of curvature of a surface\". He became an instructor at Johns Hopkins that year, but also took up work at the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. In that capacity he produced the text for A Treatise on Projections for workers at the Geodetic Survey. Craig and Simon Newcomb read Leo Königsberger's Theory of Functions also. Thomas married Louise Alford, daughter of General Benjamin Alvord, on May 4, 1880. The couple raised two daughters, Alisa and Ethel. After 1881 Craig was totally committed to Johns Hopkins, particularly anticipating Arthur Cayley's lectures on theta functions when he came over for the Spring semester of 1882. Besides the calculus courses, Craig taught differential equations, elliptic functions, elasticity, partial differential equations, calculus of variations, definite integrals, mechanics, dynamics, hydrodynamics, sound, spherical harmonics, and Bessel functions. When the American Journal of Mathematics was launched in 1877 Craig was tasked with recording expenses, as these were underwritten by Johns Hopkins University. His report at the end of 1882 gave the total just under ten thousand dollars. Thomas Craig died May 8, 1900. With information supplied by Luther P. Eisenhart, Simon Newcomb wrote the notice in the American Journal of Mathematics"

In 1903–1918, Daukantas served in the Imperial Russian Navy. He attended Naval Training School at St. Petersburg (1903–1906). In 1911–1914, Daukantas attended High Naval Training School at St. Petersburg from which he graduated with a Silver Star in Naval Tactics Training. In 1913, he published \" The Defense of Abu-Alaud \" and in 1916, \"Essays on Naval Tactics\". Later he published the articles \"The Defense of Coasts\", \"The War on Rivers\". He published the books The South of Brazil and Our Way to Vilnius. After World War I, Daukantas returned to Lithuania in 1922. He was head of education section of the Senior Officers Academy in Kaunas until 1924. Twice, in 1924–1925 and 1927–1928, he served as the Lithuanian Minister of Defense.In between serving as the Lithuanian Minister of Defense, he was the Chief of the General Staff of the Lithuanian Army. In his diary for 1927, American diplomat Robert Heingartner who served in Lithuania recorded that \"Colonel Daukantas is said to be so powerful in the army that no government could last a day without his support.\"  In 1928, he was promoted to brigadier general (in 1936, he was changed to lieutenant general). He was Lithuanian Consul General in Rio de Janeiro (1932–1935) and Minister Plenipotentiary of South America (1936–1939). On October 20, 1932, Daukantas co-signed a Treaty # 3542 with Carlos Saavedra Lamas under the League of European Nations which insured a convention or treaty between the Argentine Republic and the Independent Republic of Lithuania concerning reciprocity with respect to the payment of compensation for industrial accidents signed at Buenos Aires on October 20, 1932. Daukantas was a Member of the States Council, Chargé d'Affaires for Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, (1930 -1935). In 1941 Daukantas was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured during the Soviet rule of Lithuania, and persecuted by the Nazi German Gestapo in 1942-1944 during their occupation. He was liberated at the beginning of the German–Soviet War, moved to Germany until 1949, and then to Argentina. He remained in Buenos Aires, Argentina until his death in 1960. His remains were reburied in Karmėlava, Lithuania in 1997."

In 1889 he published an important critical edition of the \"Supplices\" of Æschylus, in recognition of the merits of which work the degree of Doctor in Letters was conferred upon him by the University of Cambridge. He is a contributor to various literary and philological publications, and has collected into a volume entitled \"Things Worth Thinking About\" a series of lectures on literature and culture previously delivered in Melbourne. A critical edition of \"Thucydides, Book VIII.,\" was printed in 1892, the same year he represented Melbourne University at the Dublin University celebration. Tucker died in Stope Cove, Devon, England, on 24 January 1946, survived by the two daughters and son of his first marriage (to Annie Mary Muckalt who died in 1933)."

  "text" : "Toshio Narahashi (January 30, 1927 to April 21, 2013) was an internationally known pharmacologist. He was the John Evans Professor of Pharmacology and former chair of the Department of Pharmacology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, where he served on the faculty from 1977 to 2013. Prior, he was vice chairman of the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at Duke University, where he served on the faculty from 1962 to 1977. He is considered by many to be the \"founding father of neurotoxicology\" and is credited with discovering how tetrodotoxin, the poison in puffer fish, immobilizes parts of the nervous system.Born in Tokyo, Japan, Narahashi received an undergraduate degree in agriculture from the University of Tokyo in 1948. According to the Chicago Tribune, \"He began his career studying insecticides in an entomology lab. His findings in the lab helped form the basis of 26 published papers and a doctorate in neurotoxicology that he would earn in 1960 from the University of Tokyo.\"  He came to the U.S. in 1961 and quickly found work as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago before joining the faculty at Duke University. Narahashi's seminal discoveries are: \n*  Ion channels as a basis for insecticidal actions \n*  Nerve sensitivity as a basis for the negative temperature dependence of insecticidal action of DDT \n*  Nerve sensitivity as a major mechanism explaining insecticide resistance leading eventually to the current concept of kdr and super-kdr \n*  Tetrodotoxin (TTX), the puffer fish poison, blocks sodium channels selectively and potently Narahashi received numerous awards during his career, including: \n*  Society Award from the Society of Entomology and Zoology (1955) \n*  Cole Award from the Biophysical Society \n*  Javets Neuroscience Investigator Award from the National Institutes of Health (1986–1993) \n*  Burdick & Jackson International Award from the American Chemical Society (1989) \n*  Merit Award from the Society of Toxicology (1991) \n*  Otto Krayer Award from the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (2000) \n*  First Distinguished Investigator Lifetime Achievement Award in Neurotoxicology from the Society of Toxicology Neurotoxicology Specialty Section (2001) \n*  Honorary Member of the Japanese Pharmacology Society (2002)  \n*  Distinguished Toxicology Scholar Award from the Society of Toxicology (2008)"

  "text" : "Theodore Philes (Greek: Θεόδωρος Φιλῆς) was a Byzantine nobleman and governor of Thessalonica in the mid-13th century. Theodore is the first notable member of the Philes family. He was appointed governor of Thessalonica by the Nicaean emperor John III Vatatzes sometime between 1248 and 1252, when the previous governor, Andronikos Palaiologos, died. This post, apparently designated with the title of \"praetor\", entailed a very wide remit, encompassing military, fiscal and judicial authority over the lands and cities of Macedonia that were in Nicaean hands. During his governorship, Philes slighted the Nicaean heir-apparent, Theodore II Laskaris, who now became his avowed enemy. When Theodore II succeeded to the throne in 1254, Philes and another leading noble, Constantine Strategopoulos, were blinded at the emperor's orders for lèse-majesté. He was succeeded as praetor in Thessalonica by the historian George Akropolites. Consequently Philes and his family became supporters of the aristocratic opposition around Michael Palaiologos, and after Theodore II's death in 1258 supported him in his bid for control of the empire against the regent, George Mouzalon. In 1259, Michael Palaiologos, now emperor, sent Philes on a diplomatic mission to the Epirote court of Michael II Komnenos Doukas, but achieved no success, reportedly due to Michael's arrogance. Theodore Philes had one son, Alexios Philes, later megas domestikos."

Brune designed several churches along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana. His Gothic architecture design for the Blessed Virgin Mother Catholic Church on West Howard Avenue in Biloxi Mississippi was constructed after the original church was destroyed by the Great Biloxi Fire of November 1900 on the same site. In early 1906,stain glass windows were donated to by Julia Dulion Lopez (1857-1918) in memory of her late husband. Frederick Thornley of New York was employed to install the windows designed and built by Reis and Reis of Munich, Germany. Brune died in New Orleans on March 8, 1932 at 1303 3rd Street.

  "text" : "Tim Laman is an American ornithologist and wildlife photojournalist who in 2007, published his first article about the birds of paradise for the National Geographic. He is known to be the first photographer who photographed all of the species of birds of paradise in their natural habitat. In 2016, he won the top prize in the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Awards, for his image of an orangutan climbing a tree to feed on figs. Tim first traveled to the rain forests of Borneo in 1987 and the Asia-Pacific region has been a major focus for both his photography and scientific research ever since. His pioneering research in Borneo’s rain forest canopy led to a PhD from Harvard University and his first National Geographic article in 1997 which he both wrote and photographed. Since then, he has pursued his passion for exploring wild places and documenting little-known and endangered wildlife as a regular contributor to National Geographic magazine, where he has published 21 feature stories. Tim has also published more than a dozen scientific articles on rainforest ecology and birdlife, and is a research associate in Harvard University's Ornithology Department. Tim has a well-earned reputation for being able to come back with images from the wild of nearly impossible subjects, including the Sunda flying lemur and other gliding animals in Borneo, displaying birds-of-paradise, and some of the world’s most critically endangered birds: the Nuku Hiva pigeon and the Visayan wrinkled hornbill, both found in the Philippines. He relishes such challenges, and firmly believes that promoting awareness through photography can make a difference for conservation. Tim’s work has garnered numerous awards, including the highest honor of the North American Nature Photography Association in 2009: their annual “Outstanding Nature Photographer” Award. Ten of his images have won recognition in the BBC Wildlife Photographer of the Year awards; and he has won several prizes in the Nature’s Best International Photography awards including first place in the Underwater category. Tim recently completed his most ambitious project to date: the first comprehensive photographic coverage of the extraordinary Birds of Paradise, a collaboration with ornithologist Edwin Scholes. They are the world’s most spectacularly ornamented birds but inhabit rugged and remote regions where they pose an extreme challenge to locate and photograph in their dense rain forest homes in the rugged and remote regions of New Guinea. He and Ed spent over 18 months doing fieldwork in the New Guinea region over an eight-year period with support from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Conservation International, and the National Geographic Expeditions Council. Their book, BIRDS OF PARADISE: REVEALING THE WORLD'S MOST EXTRAORDINARY BIRDS, was published by National Geographic Books in 2012. This work is also featured in a National Geographic Channel documentary, a new National Geographic magazine article in December 2012, and a major traveling educational museum exhibition, all in the hopes of protecting these magnificent birds and New Guinea’s biodiverse rain forests. Tim has led many expeditions as a National Geographic Expert with Lindblad Expeditions and National Geographic Expeditions. Not only does he teach photography but also educates participants on the local wildlife and natural history. He has helped people go beyond the basics of how to use their camera in many remote locations around the world including the Galapagos, Antarctica, South Georgia, Botswana, and Rwanda. Recently he has brought his expertise in wildlife photojournalism to Wildlife Of The World By Private Jet, which includes exploring the underwater world of the Maldives. Tim’s experience in executing expeditions in remote parts of the world along with his knowledge of ecology and natural history always informs and entertains his students. visit his website at www.timlaman.com Tim Laman's tree-climbing exploits and doctoral research feature in Chapter 7 of Mike Shanahan's 2016 book Ladders to Heaven: How fig trees shaped our history, fed our imaginations and can enrich our future, republished in North America as Gods, Wasps and Stranglers (US)."

  "text" : "Timi Abibu Lagunju was an eminent Yoruba monarchs and leaders of the 19th century. He made history not only as the first Muslim Timi that Ede produced, he also belonged to the first generation of Yoruba Muslims who held high political office in the pre-colonial era and who used their positions to enhance the growth of his town, Ede and his religion, Islam. Indeed, Abibu Lagunju was also the first Muslim Oba in Yorubaland given the fact that he was already on the throne for a few years when, in November 1857, the American Baptist Missionary, Reverend W.H. Clarke, visited Ede. This position is further buttressed by the fact that other Yoruba Muslim strongholds only produced their Muslim Obas at a much later date: Lamuye of Iwo in 1860, Momodu Latoosa of Ibadan in 1871, Iyanda Oloko of Epe in 1875, Ewi Aladesanmi Ajimudaoro of Ado Ekiti in 1892, Aseyin \"Noo\" (Nuruddin) of Iseyin in 1895, Alaafin Lawani Agogoja of New Oyo in 1905 and Awujale Adeona Fusigboye of Ijebu-Ode in 1906. Lagunju was certainly a force to reckon with in the history of Islam in Ede. Timi Lagunju also deserves historical attention because he was certainly one of the most outstanding personalities and warrior-rulers of the 19th century Yorubaland. He knew personally and was well acquainted with most Yoruba military, political and religious leaders of note between 1840 and 1900. Lagunju's era is also worthy of study because he was the most enigmatic Timi to have ruled Ede since the 19th century till date. He set the record of being the only Timi to have been dethroned thrice, got himself reinstated twice but eventually lost out on the third count."

  "text" : "Thomas Hinderwell (1744–1825) was a British, eighteenth-century historian. He is probably best remembered for his History of Scarborough, which was first published in York in 1798. Fellow antiquarian John Bigland described it as \"one of the most accurate and interesting works relating to this or any other part of England\". After his death, his collection of books, manuscripts, pictures, and fossils formed the basis of Scarborough's Rotunda Museum, one of the oldest purpose-built museums still in use in the United Kingdom. To celebrate his achievements, a memorial drinking fountain was erected in Scarborough in his memory. A stone plaque bearing the dedication to him was placed opposite, but has since been replaced with a plaque under the blue plaque scheme. There is a second memorial to him in the Rotunda."

After attending schools in her hometown she entered the English Literature Department of Kobe College, and graduated in 1939. She then joined the publishing department of the Takarazuka Revue, where she became acquainted with the future star Fubuki Koshiji. When Koshiji decided to leave the revue in 1951 to join Tōei and become an actress and singer, Iwatani also quit the company, and moved to Tokyo with Koshiji, whose manager she was for about 30 years, until Koshiji died in 1980. After becoming a full-time independent lyricist in 1963, she wrote the lyrics to or translated over 3000 songs, for singers or groups including The Peanuts, Yūzō Kayama, Frank Nagai, Hiromi Go, and translated the lyrics of, among others, Hymne à l'amour, Save the Last Dance for Me, Million Roses, My Way, and the musicals Kiss Me, Kate, Anne of Green Gables – The Musical, Me and My Girl, and Les Misérables. In 2010 she established the Iwatani Tokiko Foundation, which awards the annual ¥3,000,000 yen Iwatani Tokiko Award. She died in October 2013 from pneumonia."

Szehinskyj emigrated to the United States after the war, but was named as a war criminal by the United States Department of Justice in 2000, subsequently had his citizenship revoked, and is facing attempts to deport him from the country. He is on the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of most wanted Nazi war criminals. The Szehinskyj family were Ukrainians resident in Poland. Fluent in both Polish and Ukrainian, he grew up on his parents' farm in Mallnow and worked there after completing seven grades of school. After the Soviets occupied Mallnow during World War II and collectivized agriculture, he left his farm and moved to Lvov, where he was captured by the Germans in early 1942. He was transported to Vienna and worked intermittently on a farm in Austria. From 1943 to early 1945 he allegedly served in the Waffen-SS belonging SS Totenkopf Division in the concentration camps of Gross-Rosen, Sachsenhausen and Warsaw. He was allegedly involved in the transport of prisoners from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Mauthausen concentration camp shortly before the war ended in 1945. In 1950 Szehinskyj emigrated with his wife and daughter to the United States and worked as a machinist for General Electric."

Hailing from Collingwood, Melbourne, Upton learned his trade in England as a consulting engineer designing bridges and buildings before returning to Australia to work for the Victorian Country Roads Board. He served as a sapper for the Royal Navy during World War I and was then commissioned as lieutenant in the Royal Engineers until being wounded and evacuated in February 1916. He returned to the front a year later before being wounded a second time and sent to the rear lines as a staff officer and acting captain. Three times mentioned in dispatches, he was discharged in 1919 and awarded the Order of the British Empire. Returning to the Victorian Country Roads Board following a brief stay in the United States, Upton worked for ten years on the roadways of Victoria. He designed a bridge at Geelong that spanned the River Barwon. Marrying Jessie Toon Smith in 1921, he also began lecturing at local universities. He was widowed, however, in 1922, and married Irene Dodgshun in 1925 after moving to Sydney. He was heavily involved in modernising the road systems of New South Wales and working for the State Department of Transport. He moved to the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board in 1935, and worked there until the outbreak of the Second World War whereupon he designed dockyards for the Royal Australian Navy. After the way he helped design the Warragamba Dam until his retirement in 1955. Awarded honorary doctorates from both the University of Melbourne and University of Western Australia, Upton was also given several honorary titles in local church organisations for his services to them. He died in 1956 of a coronary occlusion."

  "text" : "Tao Porchon-Lynch (born Täo Andrée Porchon, August 13, 1918) is a yoga master and award-winning author. She discovered yoga in 1926 when she was eight years old in India and studied with Sri Aurobindo, B.K.S. Iyengar, K. Pattabhi Jois, Swami Prabhavananda, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Dr. Roman Ostoja. She still teaches six to eight classes a week in New York, and leads programs across the globe. She is the author of two books, including her autobiography, Dancing Light: The Spiritual Side of Being Through the Eyes of a Modern Yoga Master, which won a 2016 IPPY Award and three 2016 International Book Awards. In the front matter endorsement, Dr. Deepak Chopra said: \"One of the most acclaimed yoga teachers of our century, Tao Porchon-Lynch... is a mentor to me who embodies the spirit of yoga and is an example of Ageless Body Timeless Mind. Like yoga, she teaches us to let go and to have exquisite awareness in every moment.\" In May 2012, Guinness World Records recognized Porchon-Lynch as the world's oldest yoga instructor at age 93; the previous record-holder was then-91-year-old Berniece Bates of Florida. Tao is also an activist, oenophilist and competitive ballroom dancer. In 2015, she appeared on Season 10 of America's Got Talent. Over her 75-year professional life, she was a couture model, actress, film producer, international film distributor, television executive, publisher and a co-founder of the American Wine Society. She marched with Mahatma Gandhi twice and helped people escape the Nazis as a French Resistance fighter during World War II. Her mantra is: There Is Nothing You Cannot Do. In a November 2015 ABC World News interview Porchon-Lynch was called the \"Real-Life Forrest Gump\" since she participated in so many historic events over almost a century. In her autobiography Dancing Light, she describes personal encounters with many notables including Mahatma Gandhi, General Charles de Gaulle, Ernest Hemingway, Marcel Marceau, Marlene Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Wilding, Marilyn Monroe, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, Burgess Meredith, Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Lana Turner, Debbie Reynolds, Joan Davis, Jim Backus, Red Skelton, Vincent Price, Jack Cummings, Kathryn Grayson, Leslie Caron, Arlene Dahl, Richard Greene, Hugh O’Brian, David Sarnoff, Joan Crawford, Lucille Lortel, Duke Ellington, Katherine Dunham, Ilka Chase, Dr. Welthy Fisher, Jean Dessès, Jeanne Lanvin, Coco Chanel, Marcel Rochas, Jean Patou, Elsa Schiaparelli, Louis Vaudable, Robert Mondavi, Dr. Konstantin Frank, among others."

  "text" : "Theodore Friederick Ulrich, DSO & Bar, VD (10 December 1888 – 12 December 1963) was an Australian officer in the First Australian Imperial Force during the First World War. Born in Ararat, Victoria to a family of German ancestry, he spent his childhood in Melbourne and early adult life employed as a clerk for a firm under the ownership of Sir Charles Wellington Connibere. In 1911 he enlisted in the Citizens Military Force, serving in the 1st Battalion of the 6th Australian Infantry Regiment until 1912 when he transferred to the East Melbourne Regiment. Ulrich was shipped out to Egypt as a lieutenant in October 1914. In April 1915 he landed at Gallipoli and was promoted to captain two days later. He succumbed to illness in November and was evacuated, recuperating until February 1916 whereupon he deployed in France as a major, and shortly after a brigade major. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order during the Battle of the Somme as well as being mentioned in dispatches. He took command of a battalion in July 1917, and was wounded at the Battle of Ypres in October that year but needed only a few days to recuperate. In April 1918 his assumed command as a temporary lieutenant colonel after his superior officer was killed. He led his command at the Battle of Lihons and the Battle of Herleville Wood where he received a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order, and was twice more mentioned in dispatches. Ulbrich was returned to Australia in 1919 and placed in command of militia units. He moved into business as a butcher and was married. He remained in civilian life until the outbreak of the Second World War where he was given command of an Australian-based garrison until 1945 when he retired once more to business."

McCombie was born in Tillyfour, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the son of Charles McCombie and his wife Anne, née Black. McCombie arrived at Melbourne (then in the Port Phillip District of New South Wales) in April 1841.1845 he was a member of the committee appointed at a public meeting held in Melbourne on 28 September to frame a petition to the Imperial Parliament in opposition to the proposal of New South Wales to pledge the credit of Port Phillip for an immigration loan for her own benefit. McCombie was one of the first members of the Melbourne Town Council. In 1846 he took an active part in exerting pressure on the Superintendent of Port Phillip, Charles La Trobe, to expend the moneys voted by the Sydney Legislature for public works in Melbourne, and which La Trobe had withheld owing to his distrust of local administration. On 15 June McCombie submitted the following motion to the Council, which was carried by nine votes to five: \"That the Legislative Committee be instructed to prepare an humble petition to her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen praying for the removal of Charles Joseph La Trobe, Esq., from the office of Superintendent of the district of Port Phillip on account of his systematic mismanagement of the money voted for the service of the province, his neglect of public works of paramount consequence, and his repeated breaches of faith in his official transactions with this Council in matters of high public importance.\" On 3 August following McCombie presided at a great public meeting held in Melbourne, when a resolution was carried for the despatch of a petition to the Home Government for the removal of La Trobe. The petition was courteously acknowledged, but not acted on. In 1848 McCombie took an active part in what was known as the non-election movement, under which it was proposed to abstain from sending members from Port Phillip to the Sydney Legislature. As, however, a local candidate persisted in standing for the city of Melbourne, McCombie proposed the nomination of Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey, and he was returned by a large majority. In the outside districts the non-electionists were not so successful. They put the Duke of Wellington, Lords Palmerston, Brougham, and John Russell, and Sir Robert Peel in nomination for the five seats, but in the result five local candidates were returned. On the subject of these proceedings McCombie addressed lengthy letters to Hawes, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, and to Lord John Russell. He also took an active part in the anti-transportation movement, subscribing a hundred guineas towards the funds of the Australasian League in 1851. Though McCombie had been one of the most prominent advocates of the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales, he was not elected to the mixed Legislative Council when in 1851 the colony of Victoria was constituted. In 1856, however, when responsible government was conceded, McCombie was returned to the Upper House for the Southern Province. He was a member of the second John O'Shanassy Ministry without portfolio from March 1858 to October 1859. Latterly McCombie eschewed public life, and was connected with the press in Geelong. He was the author of \"New Plan of Colonial Government\" (1845); \"Waste Land Acts Considered\" (1846); \"Australian Sketches,\" reprinted from Tait's Magazine (1847); \"History of the Colony of Victoria\" (London, 1858). In March 1868, McCombie was elected to the lower house seat of Gippsland South, which he held until resigning around March 1869.In 1869 McCombie sailed with his family aboard the Talbot bound for London. After suffering greatly McCombie died on 2 October 1869 in Scotland aged 50; he was survived by his wife and two daughters of their four children."

In 1505, he moved to the University of Basel, where he worked as Sententiarius. Among his students were Ulrich Zwingli and Leo Jud. In 1507, he became a priest appointed by the town church in Biel. He continued his studies and received a doctorate in theology in 1515. In the years 1515 to 1520, he was chorus master (custodian) of the St. Vinzentenstifts in Bern, Biel. From 1520, he worked until his death in Biel. In a reply to Zwingli Wyttenbach on 15 June 1523, he stated that he rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation. Wyttenbach married in the summer of 1524 (name of wife unknown), which is why he was dismissed from his sinecure at the town church. He preached in the church but on the Biel John."

He held office as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. After the change of monarchy in 1485 his loyalty to the new Tudor dynasty was deeply suspect, and he was involved in two attempts to put a pretender on the English throne. On each occasion he was disgraced, fined and removed from office; yet he had sufficient influence to ensure his return to favour and high office. He is principally remembered as the builder of the impressive Dunsoghly Castle, at Finglas, which still exists. He should not be confused with his uncle, Sir Thomas Fitz-Christopher Plunket."
