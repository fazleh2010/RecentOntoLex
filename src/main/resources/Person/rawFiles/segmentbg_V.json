Although she played the benefit performance of the Follies in Walsh's memory, Biddle ended her career on the stage in the wake of the accident, and her injuries also forced her to abandon dancing. She sued Richman for $50,000 damages but received only $50. Biddle married twice and had three children, later forging a career as a realtor in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. In 2003 she suffered injuries in a car accident and died shortly afterwards."

  "text" : "Valleran le Conte or Valleran-Lecomte (fl. 1590 – c. 1615) was an influential French actor-manager and is one of the earliest for whom documentation exists. He dominated theatrical activity in Paris between 1606 and 1612. From 1592 to 1593 he was a strolling player in the provinces. In 1592 he was performing in Bordeaux, and in 1593 in Frankfurt, where he requested permission to present Biblical tragedies that he claimed to have already given in Rouen and Strasbourg, along with plays by Étienne Jodelle. Not long afterwards he was leading his own company, paying Alexandre Hardy to write plays, and employing Marie Venier as his leading actress. In 1599, in association with an actor named Adrien Talmy, he signed a three-month lease for the Hôtel de Bourgogne in Paris and formed a company named the Comédiens du Roi. According to Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux in his Historiettes, when Valleran le Conte first played in Paris, he collected the admission fee at the entrance to the theatre himself. Money problems only permitted him to perform intermittently in Paris, and on several occasions he was forced to tour in the provinces and the Low Countries, sometimes reconstituting his troupe or merging it with another. The older actor Agnan Sarat, who in 1578 had brought his own company to Paris and leased the Hôtel de Bourgogne, became the chief comedian in Valleran le Conte's company in 1600 and remained with him until Sarat's death in 1613. Valleran le Conte himself was well received as an actor, performing the young lover in Commedia dell'Arte plays and also in farce. He is noted for giving the plays of Hardy and worked with other well-known actors, including Bellerose, Bruscambille, Gaultier-Garguille, Gros-Guillaume, and Montdory. His interactions with Italian troupes in Paris influenced the subsequent Italianate style of French acting in the early 17th century. In 1612 he left Paris, forming yet another company to tour the provinces, but recently discovered documents show he was back in Paris again in 1615."

  "text" : "Vivian Trow Thayer (1886–1979) is best known as a Progressive educator who authored many books about American education. He was married to Florence Amelia Adams. Thayer was born in Nebraska and raised in rural Wisconsin. Thayer's father worked as a minister, rural mail-carrier, and farmer. The economic challenges of Thayer's early life impacted his sensitivity to the struggle of others later in his career. He attended Carroll Academy, and then moved to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he received his B.A., M.A., and Ph. D in Philosophy. While pursuing his degrees, Thayer worked to support himself through employment first as an attendant at a sanitarium, then in a restaurant, and later waiting tables in a boarding house. At one point, financial constraints forced him to take a two-year leave from the University and serve first as principal of an elementary school, and later as Superintendent of Schools, in Ashland, Wisconsin. During his tenure as Educational Director of the Ethical Culture Schools in New York City from 1928–1948, Thayer was involved with the Progressive Education Association. His role and work in the Eight-Year Study led to the formation of a second commission which he chaired: the Commission on the Secondary School Curriculum. The results of the commission were published in Reorganizing Secondary Education (1939). Thayer is associated with the educational philosophy of John Dewey, and worked with many leading Progressive educators. Among others were Boyd H. Bode, Horace Kallen, and Harold Alberty. Thayer lectured and taught at many universities, including Teacher's College, Columbia University; Harvard University; Ohio State University; the University of Hawaii; the University of Virginia; and Johns Hopkins University. In 1933, Thayer was one of the original signories of the Humanist Manifesto (I). He served in editorial positions for the American Review and the Journal of Educational Research. Thayer was named a Kappa Delta Pi Laureate, Pioneer Humanist of the Year (1964) by the American Humanist Association, and in 1969 received the Distinguished Lifetime Service to Education award from The John Dewey Society."

Tacitus writes their uncle was \"renowned and popular with his countrymen,\" but after a long reign, he \"became a tyrant, and the enmity of neighbours, joined to intestine strife, was his ruin.\" Around 50 AD, assisted by the Hermunduri king Vibilius, Vangio and Sido led the deposition of Vannius. Emperor Claudius, decided to stay out of the conflict, fearing that the Lugii and other Germanic tribes would be attracted by the \"opulent realm which Vannius had enriched during thirty years of plunder and tribute.\" Vangio and Sido easily overthrew Vannius, after which the realm was subsequently divided between them. Tacitus writes that Vangio and Sido were \"admirably loyal\" to the Romans, but among their subjects, by whom they were \"much loved\" while seeking to acquire power, they became \"yet more hated when they acquired it.\""

  "text" : "Viktor Widkvist (1881-1952) was a Swedish military musician and composer. He was born Viktor Magnus Widkvist in Stockholm in the Jakob och Johannes parish on 27 December 1881. Viktor was the son of Johan Viktor Widkvist, a piano maker and tuner for Bergquist & Nilssons Pianofabrik and mother Albertina Dalqvist. As a child he learned to play the violin and the tuba. In 1898 at the age of seventeen Viktor began his military career by enlisting in the Svea ingenjörregemente (Ing 1) (First Engineer Regiment) band in Stockholm performing on the tuba and flute under music director Adolf Johnsson. He began his study at the Stockholms Musikkonservatorium in 1901 graduating in 1908. His professors included Magnus Ahlbergm (violin) and Ernst Henrik Ellberg (counterpoint). He also studied violin with Sven Kjellström after the violinist’s return to Sweden from Paris in 1909. He was promoted to music sergeant in 1903. Between 1910-1918 while serving in military bands he was also concertmaster in several Stockholm orchestras. He served as bandmaster of the Bodens ingenjörregemente (Ing 3) (Third Engineer Regiment) band in Boden, Sweden from 1918 and the Göta ingenjörregemente (Ing 2) (Second Engineer Regiment) in Karlsborg from 1922 to 1925. He received his lieutenant's commission on 5 December 1919. Another famous Swedish march composer and bandmaster Sam Rydberg also served in the engineer regiment bands and the two formed a friendship and competed as march composers. Rydberg’s “På vakt” became the official march of the Svea ingenjörkår (Ing 1) and Widkvist’s “Bodens ingenjörregementes marsch” was adopted in 1922 as the official march of the Bodens ingenjörregemente (Ing 3). In 1925 Viktor retired from military service at the age of 44 following the government’s reduction in the number of military bands from 60 to 34. Widkvist, an excellent violinist, appeared as a violinist in orchestras and tubist in civilian bands (sometimes performing with his friend Rydberg). He also taught elementary school music at the Ängby school.He was awarded knight of the Order of Vasa. Widkvist died after a short illness on 22 December 1952."

Before the election, Fortov was the director of the Joint Institute for High Temperatures. Fortov studied physics at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, where he graduated from in 1968. In 1971, he received his Candidate of Sciences degree, and in 1976 the Doctor of Sciences degree. Since 1982, he was a professor at the same university. Between 1971 and 1986 Fortov was employed at the Institute of Chemical Physics in Chernogolovka, and between 1986 and 1992, still being a part-time researcher at the same institution, he was also employed by the Joint Institute for High Temperatures. In 1992, he was appointed the director of this institute. From 1993 to 1997, Fortov was the chairman of the Russian Foundation of Fundamental Research, the governmental organization responsible for funding of fundamental research. In 1996, he also became a chairman of the State Committee of Science and Technology, and later a minister of science and technology. The government he was a part of retired in 1998. According to the law, the President of the Russian Academy of Sciences is formally appointed by the President of the Russian Federation. Vladimir Putin, who at the time was the president of Russia, only signed the appointment of Fortov on 8 July 2013. This is because Fortov strongly criticized the reform of the Academy initiated by Putin, and he asks the President to suspend reforms and extend its ensuing suspension annually, as well as seeing Dmitry Livanov being ousted in August 2016. The research of Fortov was related to thermal physics, shock waves, and plasma physics. He was involved with applications, in particular, to energy production. Fortov is included on a sanctions list by Ukraine."

While losing 48-116 to the US Dream Team in the 1992 Summer Olympics may be considered normal due to the huge differences in both teams, Cunha is also remembered to have led Angola to an historical 20-point lead win over Spain, in the same tournament. Cunha has served as a FIBA Africa instructor. As of 2009, an annual basketball tournament in Angola named Victorino Cunha Cup, has been established in his honour."

Lundula was promoted in one leap from sergeant-major to major general on the formation of the ANC. After the severe riots that followed (the beginning of the Congo Crisis), Lundula sought to intervene in several incidents, personally rescued some Europeans from harm and averted trouble wherever possible. In September 1960, when President Kasavubu deposed Lumumba as prime minister, Lundula was jailed for two months. At the end of November 1960 he was released and escaped to Stanleyville in the Eastern Province, and became Antoine Gizenga's military chief. In January 1961, Lundula imprisoned Gizenga in Stanleyville. He died in the early 1980s."

  "text" : "Vsevolod Yur'yevich Lytkin (Russian: Всеволод Юрьевич Лыткин), born in Siberia on 17 January 1967, has since 2005 served as a bishop in the Siberian Evangelical Lutheran Church (SELC), and since 2007 has headed that denomination. After encountering Lutherans in Soviet-era Estonia, Lytkin's church career began with his 1987 baptism according to the Lutheran rite in Tallinn, Estonia. After the Supreme Soviet of Russia on 6 September 1991 officially recognized the independence of Estonia, he began preaching Christianity according to the Lutheran tradition in Akademgorodok, a suburb of Novosibirsk, Siberia. He later created additional Lutheran communities in Khakassia, Buryatia, Tomsk, Omsk, Irkutsk, Kemerovo, Sverdlovsk and Chita, as well as in the Krasnoyarsk territory. The following year, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS), a conservative Lutheran denomination in the United States, began to actively support Lytkin's missionary efforts. In 1993 the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church (EELC) recognized Lytkin and his Novosibirsk Lutheran community as part of the EELC, a semi-independent missionary unit directly subordinate to the EELC's Archbishop Jaan Kiivit, Jr. and with its clergy receiving ordination from the Estonian church body. In May 2003, however, the Siberian Evangelical Lutheran Church, founded and headed by Vsevolod Lytkin, became independent from the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church. In 2005, SELC elected Lytkin as its bishop. Being not yet ordained, however, he was known as bishop-elect until 2007, when his official ordination took place."

  "text" : "Valerie Sayers (born 1952) is an American writer and the author of six novels: The Powers (2013); Brain Fever (1996); The Distance Between Us (1994); Who Do You Love (1991); How I Got Him Back, or, Under the Cold Moon’s Shine (1989); and Due East (1987). Brain Fever and Who Do You Love were named New York Times \"Notable Books of the Year\", and the 2002 film Due East is based on her first two novels. Reviewing Who Do You Love, The Chicago Tribune declared: \"To say that Valerie Sayers is a natural-born writer wildly underestimates the facts…. She has carved out for herself a corner of the South as clearly delineated as Faulkner’s famous Yoknapatawpha County, a sense of the importance and holiness of place that calls to mind Eudora Welty’s writing on the subject.\" Sayers was born and raised in Beaufort, South Carolina, and educated at Fordham and Columbia; she lived in New York for many years. Her writing has considered the experience of Irish Catholics in the American South, the forces of segregation and Civil Rights, and the place of pacifism in domestic politics. Sayers is most often read in the lineage of Mary Flannery O'Connor, Carson McCullers, Pat Conroy, and Walker Percy. Her stories, essays, and reviews have appeared widely in such publications as The New York Times, Washington Post, Commonweal, Zoetrope, Ploughshares, Image, Witness, and Prairie Schooner, and have been cited in Best American Short Stories and Best American Essays. Her short story \"The Other Woman\" is published in Cabbage and Bones: An Anthology of Irish American Women's Fiction (1997). The Powers, which the Washington Post described as \"brilliantly realized...in brutally elegant prose\" opens in the summer of 1941, and holds the war fever then sweeping across Europe in tension with the contemporary baseball mania sweeping up the United States, a fever fueled by the Yankees' Joe DiMaggio. The journal Image: Art, Faith, Mystery featured an interview with Sayers on \"Baseball and Fiction\". Sayers's literary awards include a Pushcart Prize for fiction and a National Endowment for the Arts literature fellowship. Northwestern University Press plans to reissue her first five novels during 2013. Since 1993, Sayers has been a professor of English and the Director of the Creative Writing Program at the University of Notre Dame. Critical discussions of Sayers's work appear in Mary E. Reichardt's Catholic Women Writers: A Bio-bibliographical Sourcebook (2001) and in Bryan Giemza's Catholic Writers and the Invention of the American South (2013). Sayers's essay \"The Word Cure: Cancer, Language, and Prayer\" appears in the journal Image."

  "text" : "Vadym Kholodenko (born 1986, in Kiev) is a Ukrainian pianist, and winner of the gold medal at the Fourteenth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, who captured the attention of jury, audience, and critics alike for \"mesmerizing and exhilarating\" performances that brought the crowd to their feet, \"[cheering] him like a rock star\". Also taking home prizes for best performance of the piano quintet and best performance of a commissioned work, Vadym highlighted the Final Round with two concerti with the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Leonard Slatkin. His cadenza in Mozart's Concerto No. 21 in C Major, K. 467, which he wrote on the plane, was praised as \"fascinatingly contrapuntal,\" showing \"the guts of a true superartist.\" Kholodenko performed over 50 engagements in 2013–14 as part of his debut season as Cliburn Gold Medalist, including the Bakersfield (CA) Symphony Orchestra, the Mann Center with The Philadelphia Orchestra, La Jolla Music Society, CU Presents, Cliburn Concerts, the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts, the Lied Center of Kansas, and Portland Piano International. Also part of his prize package, recording label harmonia mundi usa released a live CD of his award-winning Van Cliburn Competition performances on November 12, 2013, followed by a studio recording. Kholodenko has worked with Yuri Bashmet, Vladimir Spivakov, Constantine Orbelian, Mark Gorenstein, Alexander Rudin, Dmitry Liss, Eugeny Bushkov, Alexander Sladkovsky, and other distinguished conductors, and has performed across the globe in Austria, China, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Switzerland, and the United States.

Vincent was the fifth son of Henri de Rochemore (d. 1739), Chevalier de St. Louis and seigneur de la Deveze, and his wife Marie-Blanche de Ricard. He married Marie-Madeleine de Gaston in 1748 at Rochefort, and had two sons, Francois (b. 1751) and Louis (b. 1755). He arrived in Louisiana in 1758 to serve as the Commissary-General of the Marine and Ordonnateur of Louisiana. He came into almost instant conflict with Kerlerec. The two accused each other of corruption, and Kerlerec had Rochemore recalled to France to answer charges, along with two of the governor's other political enemies, Antoine Philippe de Marigny and Royal Treasurer Jean Baptiste d'Estrehan. Rochemore used his influence in France to discredit Kerlerec, who in turn was removed from his position as governor and recalled to France. Rochemore died in France in 1763, survived by his widow and two sons. His younger son, Louis, died in battle in 1778 while commanding one of the ships in the fleet of Admiral de Suffren. The older son, François, was a French military officer who was imprisoned during the French Revolution and later executed on charges of conspiracy during his imprisonment."

  "text" : "Vincenzo Pietropaolo (born in 1951) was an award-winning photographer known for photographs that display an empathy for his subjects, who has focussed on documentary photography.In 2011, Satu Repo wrote about the first of Pietropaolo's photographs to be published, in 1971, in This magazine. Those photos were of immigrant workers, on strike outside Artistic Woodwork. She described how \"The photos were remarkable in both their intensity and intimacy. You were face-to-face with these men, solemn but determined, exercising their right to organize. You couldn’t help but share the photographer’s clear empathy for them.\" Since then Pietropaolo's photographs have been widely published, have been the subject of gallery shows, and have won awards, including the Cesar E. Chavez Black Eagle Award. During the 1970s and 1980s Pietropaolo also worked in the field of city planning, choosing to devote himself exclusively to photography in 1991."

Shortly after the end of World War II, Trahan was the first farmer in the state of Louisiana to start producing crawfish in the same fields that he planted rice. This was done by rotating the crops. The rice was a summer crop, while the crawfish were a winter crop. According to biologist Percy Viosca, Jr., Trahan was given \"full credit\" for pioneering this method of producing a crawfish crop. This method of crawfish farming continues today and has grown into Louisiana's largest freshwater crustacean industry, with annual revenues that exceed US$300 million."

  "text" : "Varyon Cullie Shannon, known as V. C. Shannon (May 2, 1910 – June 1, 1989), was a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from Shreveport in Caddo Parish in northwestern Louisiana. He served from 1972 until 1979. He was the first to hold the newly created District 4 seat, having been successful in the general election held on February 1, 1972. The Shannon family has roots in McCracken County, Kentucky. Shannon's grandfather, Benjamin Franklin Shannon, Jr. (died c. 1904), fought for the Confederate States of America in the Civil War and was in 1864 a prisoner of war in Illinois. Shannon's father, John Oscar Shannon (1887-1958), was a merchant and farmer in Port Gibson in Claiborne County in western Mississippi. In 1908, John Shannon married Pearl Van (died 1964) in a ceremony performed by the then mayor of Port Gibson. John and Pearl had two sons, V. C. and Floyd Oscar Shannon (born 1914). Both Floyd and V. C. Shannon relocated to Shreveport. Shannon and his wife, the former Claire Wood (1912-1974), had two sons, the late D. Kenneth Shannon, Sr., of Birmingham, Alabama, and Varyon Stacey Shannon (1934-2009), a graduate of C. E. Byrd High School in Shreveport and Louisiana State University. A veteran of the Korean War, the junior Shannon was a businessman involved for many years in the waste disposal industry in Baton Rouge. Also, they had one daughter, Connie Gaile Shannon Emmons, who resides in Shreveport, Louisiana, born on July 10, 1941, is a graduate of Fair Park High School and Ayers Career College. It is unknown when Shannon relocated to Shreveport, presumably well before 1950. Nor is his occupation available. His House tenure corresponded with the first two terms of Governor Edwin Edwards. Shannon left the legislature with about a year remaining in his second term. He resigned and was succeeded by fellow Democrat Robert P. \"Bobby\" Waddell, subsequently a judge of the Louisiana 1st Judicial District in Caddo Parish. Shannon and his wife, Claire, who preceded him in death by nearly fifteen years, are interred at Centuries Memorial Park in Shreveport."

  "text" : "Vasily Rodionovich Petrov  (Russian: Василий Родионович Петров; 12 March [O.S. 28 February] 1875, Kharkov Governorate, Russian Empire - May 4, 1937, Moscow, USSR) was an outstanding Russian opera singer (bass). Feodor Chaliapin once commented to him, \"Ah, Vasya, if I could have your voice.\" (ru: «Эх, Вася, мне бы твой голос»). This jocular remark bore testament to Vasily Petrov's undeniable talent. Petrov was born into the large family of a village tailor. His musical abilities were evident from an early age: he learned to play the violin at the age of five, and at the age of nine he was learning to play the violin professionally, as well as singing in a choir. He graduated from a ministerial free school for the poor and began to work as a teacher. Soon after, he moved to Kharkov. In 1894, he injured a finger, preventing him from pursuing a career as a violinist. However, he still had one musical passion — singing. At the end of 1894, Vasily Petrov became a chorister with the Kharkov Cathedral. In 1895 he joined a provincial Ukrainian private Opera company, fulfilling his wish to become an operatic artist. In 1898, one of his friends asked the Directorate of the Moscow Conservatory about interviewing Vasily Petrov. Consequently, Petrov was immediately enrolled to study at the Moscow Conservatory under supervision of Anton Bartzal (Russian: Антон Иванович Барцал). He graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in 1902 and was immediately accepted into the Moscow Imperial Troup (Bolshoi Theatre) where he performed in concerts. In 1899, Petrov, who was still merely a student in the first stage of his course, replaced the ill Chaliapin as Dosifey in the opera Khovanshchina in Mamontov's Private Russian Opera company. Thus began the friendship of the two great Russian bass singers. Petrov played the role of Dosifey again in 1910 with the Zimin Opera company. During and after the revolution of 1917, he managed to retain his position at the Bolshoi Theatre due to having come from a working-class background. From 1923, as the result of complications from having contracted malaria, both of Petrov's legs atrophied leaving him reliant on prostheses in order to walk, but this did not deter him from actively performing onstage. At the invitation of Constantin Stanislavski, Petrov taught at the Stanislavski Opera studio from 1925 to 1929. He also taught at other music institutions and continued his work at the Bolshoi theatre until 1936. His last performance was at the Bolshoi theatre in June 1936 as Vasily Sobakin in the opera The Tsar's bride by N. Rimsky-Korsakov. During his career, Petrov sang in 87 different operatic roles at Bolshoi theatre. He died on May 4, 1937 in Moscow. Vasily Rodionovich Petrov remains for posterity as one of the greatest representatives of Russian vocal art. His grandson, Nikolai Arnoldovich Petrov (1943-2011), was known as an outstanding pianist."

After graduating from the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts of Paris and Angers (prof. Richard Deacon), he achieved his formation by a Phd at the National School of Fine Arts of Nantes. His work is mostly composed by sculptures, drawings, videos that intend to materialize what could be a mental space. In his site-specific installations, he opposes the exhibition space with the mental perception of another space, leading the visitor through a confusing experience, for example at the Centre d'Art de la Maréchalerie of Versailles in 2013. He takes inspiration from mathematics, computer generated imagery but also from architecture and urbanism. His materials for sculpture and installation are often modular simple construction material such as bricks, concrete blocks, wood, glass or pvc tubes. He is currently represented by the Galerie Bertrand Grimont in Paris."

He also failed to qualify or crashed in practice in eleven more race attempts, including the Indianapolis 500 in 1958 and 1959. He captured his first and only race win in his sixth race start in June 1959 at the famed Langhorne Speedway. A month later in his next race, Johnson was killed in a third-lap crash in a Non-Championship race at Williams Grove Speedway where his car was either rammed from the side by that of Joe Barzda or the wheels of their cars became entangled. Barzda's car had suffered a reported stuck throttle when entering the third turn and, after making contact, flipped over just as Johnson's. While Barzda escaped with minor injuries, Johnson died of a skull fracture and other injuries or a broken neck. Johnson's Vargo Special was the same racer in which Dick Linder had perished a few months earlier and in which Hugh Randall would be killed three years later. At the time of his death Johnson was reported to be a resident of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and a former resident of Anaheim, California, Bally, Pennsylvania, where he had moved about three years before his death, and Norristown, Pennsylvania."

After the failure of the September Uprising of 1923 he fled to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, then moved between Communist Russia and secret missions in Bulgaria. In 1933 Tanev was in Germany working for the Comintern under Georgi Dimitrov. On 9 March 1933 Tanev, Dimitrov and Blagoy Popov, along with others were arrested and charged with complicity in the Reichstag fire. All three were acquitted. Tanev was acclaimed as a hero on his return to Russia, but was forced into self-denunciation later in the 1930s. The Bulgarian Communist Party ordered him to carry out a mission in Bulgaria in 1941, where he was killed later in that year."

  "text" : "Veit Stratmann (born 1960) is a German contemporary artist, currently living in Paris. The work of Veit Stratmann has been developed since the early 1990s, influenced by artists of the neo-avant-garde of the 1970s, like Michael Asher. One of the characteristics of many of his works is the focus on the intervention on the location and the deliberate choice of a form of lower-aesthetic value. His work revolves around questioning: can an artistic gesture be based on the notions of choice and decision-making – the postures of those whoencounter the work? Can this decision-making and the infinite suspension of time involved in doing so become constructive material(Morgan Marlet describes this in her MA thesis on Veit Stratmann's work in the urban space as “suspending space to suspend time”). If political action originates in the act of decision making, can an encounter with art generate a permanent oscillation between political and artisticgestures? Can an artistic gesture undo the coherence of a space without affecting its physical integrity? Or create a “parenthesis” or construct a loophole in itsmeaning in order to create the blurring of status? Can this become creative matter? Can an artist's work be a deflector? Can art be the departure point of observation rather than that which is observed? Stratmann's work is often done in and for public space. The presence of an object in public space does not necessarily confer a particular status to that givenobject. The encounter with an object in public space does not impose any particular status or behavioural code upon the public. Both the viewer and thework viewed define the nature and the quality of this encounter. Public space thus presents an ideal place for posing questions - and a way of transforming its fragile status into creative material. Veit Stratmann's personal history is also at the root of his work in public space and it has undoubtedly conditioned the social issues that underline his line of questioning. Born in Germany, he moved to France in 1981. This displacement of his personal “territory” and focal point from a general sense of “belonging” (in Germany) to an acute awareness of “not belonging” (in France) reoriented his perception of space, territory, separation and belonging. He began to explore the possibilities of influencing his space without actually modifying it. Becoming aware of the limits of his space brought about questioning: how can the limits be made permeable? How can the interstices be used? How can these territories be adjusted, modified, transformed? The range of Veit Stratmann's artistic preoccupations is anchored in this socio-cultural and spatial questioning. Yet his line of questioning enters the sphere of “art” only when there is exchange with others – as many others as possible. This naturally pulls his artistic action towards the « polis » – public space (not thepolitical space but the space of politics). This is where decision and choice-making, negotiation, stance-taking, limitations and borders take form andmake sense."

  "text" : "Vikki Dougan (born 1929) is a model and actress. She is most famous for appearing at social events in a series of daring low-cut backless dresses throughout the 1950s. Dougan began modeling at age eleven. She made for herself a successful career in modeling before gaining her first movie role in Back from Eternity as an uncredited showgirl. She gained small parts in another nine movies. In 1953 publicity man Milton Weiss had the idea of promoting Vikki using the backless dresses to garner publicity. The idea was to gain a contrast with the fashion for models and actresses with large bosoms, such as Jayne Mansfield. Throughout the 1950s she scandalized more respectable Hollywood society with her appearances in her daring backless dresses. In 1953 photographer Ralph Crane photographed her extensively for Life Magazine. Their edition of October 26 featured her on the cover. 1961 her appearances in her backless dresses became celebrated in song by The Limeliters. It appears on the album, The Slightly Fabulous Limeliters. In June 1957 Dougan appeared in the (Vol. 4, Issue 6) edition of Playboy magazine. She featured again in the December 1962 issue, under the section \"Playboy's Other Girlfriends\". In January 1964 Cavalier magazine featured twelve nude photographs of Vikki Dougan in a pictorial entitled \"The Back is Back\". Dougan brought a lawsuit against the magazine, stating that the magazine did not have permission to publish them. The photographs had been posed for Playboy but Dougan had subsequently declined to let Playboy publish the photographs. Throughout the 1960s she dated a string of prominent Hollywood men, including Frank Sinatra."

Khatuntsev was graduated from Pokrovsky Technical School, then studied at the All-Union Communist Institute of Journalism and the History Department of Moscow State University. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, while Khatuntsev was a student at Moscow State University, he joined a militia battalion of the Presnensky District of Moscow. He then worked as a production manager in the defense industry. In 1946, Khatuntsev joined TASS as a reporter handling foreign news, then became senior editor of the International News Radio division and a foreign correspondent in Finland. In 1960 he became Deputy General Director of TASS. He subsequently worked as Deputy Chief Editor of the mass-circulation national newspaper Labor (Russian: Труд), and, on July 11, 1978, became General Director of TASS. Khatuntsev died on April 19, 1979. He is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. [Khatuntsev] was a serious, considerate man, a talented journalist, a veteran of the hard school of life. He knew the real price of everything, did not advance because of greed for high office, and did not like sycophants. They said that when Zamyatin left to head the Department of the Central Committee, he objected to Khatuntsev replacing him. But the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee had some smart people. They knew who was who, and insisted on Khatuntsev's candidacy. He wasn't Director General for long – massive heart attack. The men and women of TASS were deeply grieved. B. I.

He was born in San Secondo Parmense, and studied at the Parma Conservatory, where he learnt composition from Guido Alberto Fano. From 1912 to 1958 he taught piano, harmony, counterpoint and composition at the Florence Conservatory; there he came into contact with Ildebrando Pizzetti, who was director of the conservatory from 1917 to 1923, and who influenced Frazzi's compositional style. Frazzi also taught at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana from 1936 to 1963. His students included Bruno Bartolozzi, Bruno Bettinelli, Valentino Bucchi, Luigi Dallapiccola and Angelo Francesco Lavagnino. He died in Florence on 7 July 1975."

Some scholars believe he had a sexual relationship with Gippius, although this is not mentioned in his memoir about Gippius, Difficult Soul. In the correspondence between Gippius and Zlobin, the two played with gender ambiguity in the Russian language. He wrote about a fantasy of sleeping with her. In 1927-1928 he was the head of a journal \"New Ship\" together with Yuri Terapiano. He then worked on different projects for Gippius and helped to organise, in his Paris flat, \"Sundays\" for Russian poets and writers."

  "text" : "Valentine Jepkorir Kipketer (born 5 January 1993) is a Kenyan long-distance runner who specialises in the half marathon and marathon distances. She has won marathons in Mumbai and Amsterdam and represented her country at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics. She has personal bests of 2:23:02 hours for the marathon and 1:08:21 hours for the half marathon. Kipketer first emerged in cross country running competitions: after a fifth place at the 2008 Eurocross at the age of fifteen, in 2009 she came third at the Discovery Cross Country Championships in Eldoret and was the North Rift Valley junior champion. Her international career began in 2010 in the Netherlands: she ran a 5000 metres best of 16:22.83 minutes at the FBK Games, came third at the 4 Mijl van Groningen and was in the top ten at the Zevenheuvelenloop. Her breakthrough came the following year with her transition into road running events. She won the major Berlin Half Marathon race in 70:12 minutes. A runner-up finish at the Zwolle Half Marathon preceded another prominent victory at the Lille Half Marathon, where her winning time of 68:21 minutes (ranking her eleventh in the world that year). She dipped under seventy minutes again at the New Delhi Half Marathon, but this was only enough for seventh in a very competitive field. She opened 2012 with a win at the Lotto Cross Cup de Hannut. Her only other outing that year was a debut over the marathon distance – she was leading at the half way point but faded in the second half, ending fifth with a time of 2:28:02 hours. Kipketer won her first marathon race at the beginning of 2013, taking the title at the Mumbai Marathon in a personal best of 2:24:33 hours. Although she was only fourth at the Berlin Half Marathon, she was selected for the 2013 World Championships in Athletics. She faltered on her international debut, dropping out of the World Championship marathon. The Amsterdam Marathon saw a revival in her fortunes as she won the major race with a new best time of 2:23:02 hours, although she expressed disappointment at not having run faster."

  "text" : "Vivian Fung is a Canadian born composer. Born in Edmonton, Canada, she began composition studies with Violet Archer and later studied with Narcis Bonet in Paris, France. She received her doctorate from The Juilliard School in New York in 2002, where her mentors included David Diamond and Robert Beaser. She composes many different types of music to be performed by different groups, such as orchestras, operas, quartets, and pianists. Her music is drawn from many different cultures and she uses that inspiration to merge it with Western forms. Examples of such non-Western influences are Balinese, Javanese gamelan, and folk songs from minority regions of China. Her personal heritage has proven to play a strong role in her music. Among her many achievements, she has received a multitude of awards and grants: the 2012 Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, New York Foundation for the Arts’ Gregory Millard Fellowship, ASCAP, BMI, American Music Center, MAP Fund, Music Alive!, and the League of American Orchestras, American Composers’ Forum, and the Canada Council for the Arts. Vivian has been composer-in-residence of the Delaware Chamber Music Festival, Music in the Loft chamber music series in Chicago, the San José Chamber Orchestra, and the Billings Symphony. Vivian Fung also completed residencies at the MacDowell, Yaddo, and Banff arts colonies, as well as residencies at the Atlantic Center for the Arts. She is also an associate composer of the Canadian Music Centre. Vivian Fung‘s work has been embraced as part of the core repertoire of music by many distinguished artists and ensembles around the globe. In 2012, Naxos Canadian Classics released the world premiere recording of her 'Violin Concerto', 'Piano Concerto', her album “Dreamscapes,” and 'Glimpses' for prepared piano, with Metropolis Ensemble conducted by Andrew Cyr, featuring her personal friend, violinist Kristin Lee, and pianist Conor Hanick. Her 'Violin Concerto' earned her the 2013 JUNO Award for “Classical Composition of the Year.”  Several of her works have also been released commercially on the Telarc, Çedille, and Signpost labels. After the world premiere in March 2011 of Vivian's work 'Yunnan Folk Songs', The Chicago Tribune wrote, “Yunnan Folk Songs stood out… [with] a winning rawness that went beyond exoticism.” Vivian travels often to search for inspiration and so she has explored diverse cultures in North Vietnam, Spain, and Bali, Indonesia. In 2012, Vivian traveled to Southwest China for ethno-musicological research to study minority music and cultures in the Yunnan province. It was a continuation of the research that previously inspired 'Yunnan Folk Songs' (2011). The project was commissioned by Fulcrum Point New Music in Chicago with support from the MAP Fund. One of her most recent works to date is 'String Quartet No.3' which was a commission by the 11th Banff International String Quartet Competition (BISQC). It was performed by 10 accomplished string quartets and the American group, the Dover Quartet, won first prize. The Calgary Herald lauded the piece and even retitled it 'Dark Journeys'. Stephan Bonfield wrote, \"...recall Ms. Fung’s eloquent anguish during her pre-concert talk over the Connecticut school shootings whose reports we horribly witnessed last year, in addition to the tremendous world conflict that she was documenting, relevant at this moment in Syria, all against a backdrop of her own personal revelations about her family’s history and its journeys of struggle. Indeed, this work could one day be nicknamed along the lines of String Quartet No. 3 – the “Dark Journeys” quartet.”"
