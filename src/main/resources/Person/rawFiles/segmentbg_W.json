He is perhaps most famous for his portrait of Alexander Hamilton which hangs in the United States State Department, and his full length portrait of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, which hangs in Province House (Nova Scotia), Canada. He also worked for Joseph Booth's Polygraphic Society. Former Director and Chief Curator of the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute Paul Schweizer writes that Weaver's work \"convey [s] a chaste elegance that is similar in look and mood to the finest neoclassical portraits made in North America.\" Weaver's composition reflects a knowledge of British and French military portraiture. He painted portraits and miniatures in many of the principal cities along the Atlantic seaboard from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Savannah, Georgia. He also produced portraits of Martha and George Washington, though their locations are unknown. Weaver was one of the first professional artists to work in Halifax (c. 1797). He made portraits or miniatures of the city's merchants, aristocrats and military officers. Currently, six small portraits that Weaver painted in Nova Scotia have been identified. Five of these were painted on tinplate. There are likely more that are unsigned."

In 1868 he joined the Geological Survey of Ireland, becoming an expert on water supply. In 1881 he left, and with his brother Anthony he founded the Portrush, Bushmills, and Giant's Causeway Railway and Tramway Company. This operated the world's first electrical railway, and was funded by capital raised from friends and investors including Sir Walter Siemens and Lord Kelvin. Traill devised and patented a conduit system of burying the live rail in a pipe with electrical contact. The expected goods trade never took off, and the line remained until its closure 1949 as a summer tourist railway. In February 1887 he ran in a by-election in North Antrim as an Independent Unionist, coming in third. He married three times, and met his third wife, Nora Westwood, in 1895 when he rescued her from drowning. In 1990, the Northern Bank issued a banknote bearing a portrait of Traill."

Although he was raised in the Baptist Church, he began his affiliation with the Quakers during his university years and became a lifelong pacifist. Dr. Cousins was the first black faculty member at Wellesley College, and among the first African Americans to teach at a top liberal arts college Shortly after completing his Ph.D. at Yale University, Cousins went to India with the American Friends Service Committee and began a career in international community development. He led several projects over the years in which reliance on local leaders and community members, rather than outside aid, led to important improvement in slum living conditions. Notable among these was Cousin's work in the 1970s through UNICEF on the successful model project in Hyderabad, India's fifth largest city. There, Cousins and his team concentrated on creating a community spirit before attempting to improve homes and other community facilities."

His career faltered after the death of Queen Anne because he was known to be a Jacobite. After being arrested for his part in the Atterbury Plot, but released for lack of evidence, North and Grey took service in the army of King Philip V of Spain. He died in Madrid."

  "text" : "Willem (Wim) Betz (born February 22, 1943) is a Flemish physician and professor emeritus at the Belgian university Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), where he was head of the center for training in general medical practice until November 2007. Betz is a leading skeptic in Flanders and participant in the EU COST B4 Project (a European initiative for comprehensive research on complementary and alternative medicine). He is a founding member and current vice-president of the Belgian skeptic organization SKEPP. After twenty years as a general practitioner, he turned full-time to the teaching of general medical practice as well as conducting scientific research. He took courses in several types of alternative medicine (homeopathy, neural therapy, manual therapy) and practiced them successfully. However, he started to question the explanations given for the successes that were being claimed by alternative treatments and began to investigate the existing evidence for these methods. According to Betz, the explanations can be found in the field of psychosomatics (which studies how the mind can affect the body), in the placebo effect, in the fact that many illnesses disappear spontaneously (e.g., common colds) or fluctuate (e.g., allergies), as well as in the deceptive methods of quackery."

Born and raised in Birmingham, Warwickshire, he joined the British Merchant Navy at the age of 16 and later worked in physical training for the British Army, among other jobs. He decided to become a writer and wrote The Song of Pentecost, featuring the adventures of a group of mice who travel to a new home. It was published by Methuen in 1982, a 215-page novel with illustrations by Martin Ursell. It was an international bestseller and the 1982 Whitbread Awards Children's Book of the Year. He followed with two sequels and several other books. Beside the Pentecost trilogy (1982 to 1987), the books by Corbett most widely held in WorldCat libraries are The Ark of the People (1998) and The Quest for the End of the Tail (2000), featuring the tiny Willow People. Those were first two of three 300-page novels published by Hodder Children's Books, sometimes called the Ark of the People series. Corbett died in February 2003 and two more books were published later that year."

In the proclamation that announces the opening of the court he is styled “The Right Worshipful William Spry, Doctor of Laws.” The other officers of the new court were: vice-admiral, the Earl of Northumberland; registrar, the Hon. Spencer Percival; marshal, Charles Howard, gent. These officers probably expected to fulfil their duties by deputies. Judge Spry opened his court at Halifax on 9 October 1764. Its creation had been opposed in the colonies, and the passage of the Stamp Act the next year, with the accompanying disturbances, probably prevented its extension to other provinces. The Court was abolished in 1768. Judge Spry was appointed Governor of Barbados in June 1767. Spry arrived at Barbados the following year, and died in office in 1772."

After launching a campaign to raise the money for an operation to resolve the problem, for which he raised only $2,000, he underwent surgery in April 2013 after visiting Dr. Joel Gelman of the University of California, Irvine's Center for Reconstructive Urology, who was aware that Warren couldn't afford the surgery and so did it for free. Warren's struggles with his condition and his subsequent operation were filmed by a British television crew for a documentary The Man with the 10-Stone Testicles, which aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom on June 24, 2013.

  "text" : "William Wells (1744-27 December 1827), minister and farmer at Bromsgrove, Worcestershire; and at Brattleboro, Vermont. William Wells was born at Biggleswade. He was orphaned when young, cared for by an uncle, Ebenezer Custerson a farmer at Cardington, Bedfordshire, and educated by Rev Samuel Sanderson (1702–66) at Bedford. He studied under Caleb Ashworth at Daventry Academy, 1765–70, a fellow student with Thomas Belsham. He was appointed minister at Bromsgrove Presbyterian Chapel in 1770, where he remained until 1793. January 1771 he married Jane Hancox of Dudley. In the troubles which preceded American Independence, he took a strong interest in favour of the Colonies, taking an active part with Richard Price, Thomas Wren of Portsmouth, in garnering subscriptions for the relief of the American Prisoners. Convinced of the benefits of smallpox inoculation, he inoculated his own children, and inoculated the children of poor neighbours, who could not afford the surgeons’ fee. He is said to have spent two years riding about the country, inoculating as many as thirteen hundred children. During the Birmingham riots, his home was threatened and the meeting-house escaped only by accident. Wells had been contemplating emigration to New England since 1780. He was now resolved upon it, arriving at Boston, with his wife and eight children, 12 June 1793. He was soon joined by William Priestley, son of Dr Joseph Priestley, who stayed with the family, perhaps helping with Wells's farm. The next year, he purchased a farm at Brattleboro, Vermont, where he lived until his death. He corresponded with William Bentley and other Unitarians in New England After a year or two, he was invited to become minister at Brattleboro, but declined a formal appointment. He agreed, however, to perform the functions of that office as 'officiating pastor', on an annual basis, being annually chosen by the town for about twenty years. While he was absent on a visit to England, in 1818, he was awarded a Doctorate of Divinity from Harvard University."

  "text" : "Rev Dr. William Nicol (23 March 1887, in Robertson – 22 June 1967) was a Dutch Reformed minister, theologian, educator and Administrator of the Transvaal Province of South Africa. In 1906, he obtained his bachelor's degree at Stellenbosch University and then studied at the Free University of Amsterdam and Princeton. From 1913 to 1938 he was minister of the Dutch Reformed Church in Johannesburg East, called Irene Church. In June 1938, he became a minister in Pretoria East. From 1934 to 1948 he was moderator of the Dutch Reformed Synod of the Transvaal. In Johannesburg, he was a champion for the recognition of the Afrikaans language and the establishment of Afrikaans-medium schools. Nicol was the founder of Johannesburg East's parish magazine, Irenenuus, in January 1923, that he wanted the members in their particular situation escorted to their faith. It was written in Afrikaans in a time when the language just started gaining a foothold in schools and was rarely heard from the pulpit. Nicol in August 1923 (date uncertain) made history when he wrote the first sermon in Afrikaans broadcast on the radio directly into the radio studios in downtown Johannesburg. At 9:45 on Sunday, 7 June 1924, the minister and church made history when a full service was held in Afrikaans for the first time. He also broadcast on the Union broadcast and from Irene Hall. A month later, on 4 October 1925, the first communion service was broadcast from Irene Hall led by Nicol. On 1 November 1948 he was elected as the administrator of Transvaal and ten years later his work especially with regard to education and culture continued to grow. He retired on 1 October 1958. Nicol believed in teaching education in the person's mother tongue and said any education taught in a second language would hinder a persons growth and learning ability. Thus he helped translate the Bible with help from African religious leaders into Zulu. He opposed the National Party's Bantu Education and suggested a model with learning in the mother tongue with English as a second language so that people could all communicate. A major arterial road in Sandton, William Nicol Drive, is named after him."

Fitzherbert was educated in Wellington, at Sydney Grammar School, and at Canterbury University College. He was an engineer with the Wellington Provincial Council and with the Hutt County Council. He farmed in the Wanganui district, and then in the Hutt Valley and in Hawke’s Bay. In 1876, he married the adopted daughter of George Waterhouse, and they had five daughters and four sons. He died suddenly in Lower Hutt on 2 February 1906 of heart failure. In 2011, plaques were installed on 13 boulders at the Hutt Recreation Ground commemorating the first 13 mayors."

  "text" : "William Hay Caldwell (1859–28 August 1941) was a Scottish zoologist. Attending Cambridge University, he was the first recipient of an studentship founded in honour of his supervisor Francis Maitland Balfour, who died in a climbing accident in 1882. Two years after graduating from Cambridge in 1880, Caldwell was appointed Demonstrator in Comparative Anatomy, working for Professor Alfred Newton. In 1884, Caldwell used his studentship, which consisted of \"£200 studentship, a £500 grant, the prestige and backing of the Royal Society, and letters of introduction from Newton to travel to Australia\" to investigate whether the platypus laid eggs. With the assistance of the local Aborigines, Caldwell set up camp on the banks of the Burnett River in northern Queensland, hunting for lungfish, echidna, and platypus eggs. After extensive searching assisted by a team of 150 Aborigines, he discovered a few eggs. Mindful of the high cost per word, Caldwell famously but tersely wired London, \"Monotremes oviparous, ovum meroblastic.\" That is, monotremes lay eggs, and the eggs are similar to those of reptiles in that only part of the egg divides as it develops. Caldwell stayed away from the beginning stages of Darwinism and wanted to study evolutionary patterns himself. He believed that patterns of individual development could assist in developing and understanding the process of evolution."

Called by one of his editors \"the modern-day father of investigative journalism\", Lambert forced the resignation of Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas in 1969. His Life magazine story on Fortas won the George Polk Award for magazine reporting that year. Fortas, accused of having taken $20,000 from stock swindler Louis Wolfson in 1966, resigned nine days after Lambert's story appeared. Lambert and The New York Times reporter Wallace Turner shared the Pulitzer Prize for local reporting in 1957 for their five-part series in the Portland Oregonian focusing on Dave Beck, president of the International Society of Teamsters, and exposing corruption in the union. Lambert and Turner were the first witnesses in the congressional investigation of Beck and the Teamsters. Lambert died on February 8, 1998, in Philadelphia of a respiratory ailment. He was survived by his wife Jean Kenway Lambert and daughters Kathy (Wollen) Lambert and Heather (Oxberry) Lambert."

He is a fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities and a fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia.As a historian of science and medicine, Anderson focuses on the biomedical dimensions of racial thought, especially in colonial settings, and the globalisation of medicine and science. He has introduced anthropological insights and themes to the history of medicine and science; developed innovative frameworks for the analysis of science and globalisation; and conducted historical research into the material cultures of scientific exchange. His influential formulation of the postcolonial studies of science and medicine has generated a new style of inquiry within science and technology studies."

  "text" : "William Clark Hughes (January 31, 1868 – August 29, 1930) was a Louisiana Democrat who served from 1926 to 1928 as the Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives. He represented Bossier Parish in the lower house of the legislature from 1904 until his accidental death in 1930. Hughes was born in the Rocky Mount community of Bossier Parish to William Josiah Hughes (1837-1921), a captain in the Confederate Army, and the former Mary Ann Clark (1843-1923). His home in Rocky Mount remained in the family until 1972, when it was donated to the Bossier Restoration Foundation. In 1995, the house was relocated to Benton, the seat of Bossier Parish government. There the Hughes House sets in Benton Square near the Bossier Parish School Board office. Hughes and his first wife, Lula Dubois Hughes (1869-1899), had three daughters: Mary Virginia (born and died 1894), Martha \"Mattie\" L. Hughes Dowdell (1895-1970), and Margery Hughes O'Kelley (1896-1973). Hughes later married Annie Oliver, who was born 1882 in Giles County, Tennessee. They had one daughter, Annie Elizabeth Hughes Hale Tucker, who was born in 1906 in Shreveport, Louisiana. Hughes' legislative service traversed the administrations of seven governors from Newton C. Blanchard to Huey Pierce Long, Jr. He was Speaker of the House under Long's short-term predecessor, Oramel H. Simpson; in Louisiana despite the presumed separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, the governor handpicks the Speaker. Long chose his lieutenant, John B. Fournet, a freshman member from Jeff Davis Parish in southwestern Louisiana, who later became the long-term Chief Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Hughes operated the Kingston Plantation in the Bossier Parish community known as Hughes Spur, presumably named for Hughes' father. In 1930, at the age of sixty-two and still serving in the legislature, he was struck dead by touching a metal cistern which had been electrically charged in a lightning storm. He had intended to use the cistern to fight a lightning-induced fire on his farm. Hughes is interred at the Rocky Mount Cemetery."

In addition, he participated in the work of such the Carmelite church, a church cloister in Bielany, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Miechów. Rojowski also decorated the chapel of Bishop Andrzej Stanisław Załuski in the Wawel Cathedral, including a carved statue of the bishop.

He clerked for the New York Legislature and railroad in Albany before moving to Hartford, Connecticut to attend Trinity College in 1872. In 1892 he was appointed to the staff of Morgan Bulkeley with the rank of Colonel. In 1906 he was selected to serve as vice president of Colt's Manufacturing Company. He was elected President three years later and served in this capacity until 1911. After a 5-year hiatus he resumed this position in 1916 and served as president of Colt a second time until 1921 when he resigned to become chairman of the company's board of directors. In anticipation of the military draw down following World War I, Skinner implemented a diversification program at Colt's Manufacturing similar to that done at the close of the American Civil War. Skinner acquired contracts for business machines, calculators, dishwashers, motorcycles, and automobiles; all marketed under a name other than Colt. Other measures included cutting the work week, reducing salaries, and keeping more employees on the payroll than they needed, all of which kept the company in business after Skinner's retirement."

  "text" : "Walter \"Little Man\" Buchanan, Jr. (born 1915) is a jazz bassist known for his work in the late 1940s-early 1950s as a member of various line-ups led by saxophonist Arnett Cobb. In April 1944 he was playing in a band led by Jesse Miller at Joe's Deluxe Club, in Chicago, with Albert Atkinson (sax), Ike Day, Argonne Thornton (piano), and Kermit Scott. In January 12, 1949 he recorded with Milt Larkin's band for Savoy Records together with Buck Clayton, Hal Singer, George Rhodes on piano, and Joe Harris on drums. In February 1949 he recorded again for Savoy, as a member of the Hal Singer Sextet, comprising Tate Houston, Buchanan, Butch Ballard, George Rhodes, Chippy Outcalt and Willie Moore, and on the same session, the same line-up recorded another track backing Chicago Davis. An August 1949 issue of Down Beat features a photograph by William P. Gottlieb showing Buchanan onstage with Cobb at the Apollo Theater, New York. In October 1950 he married Dinah Washington, but their marriage broke up only a few months later. In February 1951 heis credited as backing Washington on four tracks for Mercury Records. The line-up is unknown except for Wynton Kelly. Due to the imminent breakup of their marriage, however, some sources suggest that Buchanan would probably not have attended the recording session. Buchanan then recorded on a series of sessions with different line-ups led by Cobb and, in August 1951, with a septet comprising Cobb, Willie Moore, Dickie Harris, Johnny Griffin, George Rhodes, Buchanan, and Al Walker on drums. In June 1953 he recorded again with Cobb, this time billed as Arnett Cobb and His Orchestra, with Ed \"Tiger\" Lewis (trumpet), Dickie Harris (trombone), Cobb, Charlie Ferguson (tenor, baritone saxophone), George Rhodes (piano), Walter Buchanan (bass), and Al Walker (drums). Arnett Cobb & His Orchestra recorded again, on an unknown date, with a different line-up, this time comprising Buchanan, George Jones on drums, George Rhodes, Cobb, Michael \"Booty\" Wood and David Page on trumpet."

  "text" : "William de Courcy was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and baron. William was the son of Richard de Courcy and his wife Wandelmode. The family was from the Calvados region of Normandy. William inherited the English lands of his father about 1088. On the accession of King Henry I of England in 1100, William was appointed as a royal steward, or dapifer. There were probably four stewards in the royal household, and Henry kept in office the three he inherited from his brother – Eudo, Haimo, and Roger Bigod. William was the only new appointment to this office at the start of Henry's reign. In March 1101 William served as a surety for King Henry fulfilling a treaty with Robert II, the Count of Flanders. William pledged 100 marks as a security that would have been forfeited if the king failed to uphold the treaty terms. In 1107 William witnessed 1 charter of King Henry in Normandy and 6 more royal charters during 1110 in England. While Henry was absent from England in 1111 William was one of the advisors of Queen Matilda, who was left behind in England to govern the country. William married Emma, the daughter and heiress of William de Falaise, who was the owner of Stogursey in Somerset at the time of Domesday Book. William inherited the lands of his wife and can be considered Baron of Stogursey in right of his wife. William gave a gift of land as well as the right of advowson of the church at Nuneham Courtenay in Oxfordshire to Abingdon Abbey, with the avowdson grant being related by the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis. Shortly after these grants, William further gave to Abingdon a fishery named \"Sotiswere\". William died around 1114. He had three sons – William, Richard, and Robert. The son William inherited the barony of Stogursey. Robert may have inherited his father's royal stewardship."

  "text" : "Wang Shujin (1904-1981), also known as Wang Heng Sun, was a Chinese martial artist, expert in the disciplines of Bagua Zhang, Taiji Quan, and Xingyi Quan. He was one of the biggest impulsors of those arts outside China, being their first teacher in Taiwan and Japan. Wang was also a spiritual leader in the Taoist sect Yi Guan Dao. Shujin started training at 18 under renowned matser Zhang Zhaodong, who he served until his death 1940. He learned as well zhanzhuang qigong under Wang Xiangzhai. Wang moved to Taiwan in the 1940s, and he taught martial arts in Japan in the 1950s and 60s. He was known for being an innovator and the first teacher to teach the Taijiquan, Xingyiquan, and Baquazhang in the country of Japan, established the Cheng Ming School there and in Taiwan. He would initiate eight known disciples during his lifetime: Chao Piaosheng, Huang Jinsheng, Jibiki Hidemine, Lai Tianzhao, Rottmann Manfred, Wang Fulai, Zhang Yizhung and Wells Marnix. A man of almost 300 pounds, he was considered one of the greatest Chinese fighters, and it was said that his control of zhanzhuang and his immense strength and toughness enabled him to absorb the impact of strikes which would knock out a common person. This led to an interesting anecdote on December 14, 1954 when Wang met boxing champion Joe Louis while he was touring Taipei. Shujin challenged him to punch him in the stomach with all his power, claiming he would absorb the blow, but Louis refused on the saying he didn't want to kill Wang by accident. Wang famously hated karate, claiming it was a martial art valid only \"to fight children and old women,\" and it is said Shujin tested his skills against several karate practitioners in Japan, remaining undefeated. Another anecdote supposedly saw karateka Jon Bluming injurying his wrist when attempting to hit Wang in the belly during a sparring. Bluming, however, has stated that he was just a white belt in karate at the time, and that although it is true that Shujin absorbed his punch, Bluming wasn't injured, nor he considered it a special skill given Shujin's size and build."

  "text" : "William Benjamin Cornwell (November 25, 1864 – April 8, 1926) was an American lawyer, businessperson, newspaper editor and publisher, and railroad and timber executive in the U.S. state of West Virginia. He was an older brother of writer and newspaper publisher Marshall S. Cornwell (1871–1898) and of West Virginia Governor John J. Cornwell (1867–1953). Cornwell studied jurisprudence at the West Virginia University College of Law, and afterward began practicing law in Romney. In 1890, he and his brother, John J. Cornwell, purchased The Review and South Branch Intelligencer newspapers. Following their acquisition of the South Branch Intelligencer, they renamed the newspaper Hampshire Review. In 1900, Cornwell sold his ownership in the Hampshire Review to his brother John. While he owned the newspaper, Cornwell served as the Prosecuting Attorney for Hampshire County (1892–1900). In addition to serving as Prosecuting Attorney, he served as the Commissioner of School Lands for Hampshire County in 1900. In 1902, he relocated to Fairmont, where he engaged in the practice of law until 1910. He and his brother, John were corporators and shareholders of the South Branch Boom and Lumber Company following its incorporation in 1901. They were also corporators and shareholders of the Potomac White Sand Company of Green Spring following its incorporation in 1902. Cornwell served as the president of the Hampshire Southern Railroad which was constructed under his leadership, beginning in June 1909, and he continued to operate it until 1911 when it was purchased by the Moorefield and Virginia Railroad Company. Cornwell organized, and became the president of, the Winchester and Western Railroad which had been incorporated in 1916. In addition to serving as the company's president, he also served on its board of directors. In 1921, he also organized a subsidiary, Winchester Lumber Corporation, for the purpose of developing the timber resources of Hampshire and Hardy counties in West Virginia and Frederick County in Virginia. Cornwell served as the president and general manager of the Winchester Lumber Corporation. He died in 1926 in Romney, West Virginia and was interred next to his first wife Nannie and second wife Sophie at Indian Mound Cemetery."

William and Emma were also the parents of two other sons: Richard and Robert. William married Avice, the daughter and coheir of William Meschin, and Cecily de Rumilly. The marriage took place around 1125. William, along with his brother Robert, confirmed the gift of his father of the advowson of the church of Nuneham Courtenay in Oxfordshire to Abingdon Abbey. This reconfirmation of his father's grant was recorded in the abbey's chronicle, the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis, like the original grant had been. William then gave further lands to the abbey, including a meadow named \"cow mead\" and a pasture large enough for 300 sheep, 8 oxen and 10 cows. William died before 1130. William's widow married William Paynel, son of Fulk Paynel, as his second wife. His heir was his son William de Courcy. Another son was Robert, who was steward to King Stephen of England."

  "text" : "Whitney Snow Stoddard (March 25, 1913 – April 2, 2003) was an American art historian who specialized in medieval art. Born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, Stoddard studied art history at Williams College under the direction of Karl Weston, the charismatic chair of Williams's art department and museum. Upon graduation in 1935, Stoddard decided to pursue his interests in art history by entering a doctoral program at Harvard University, where he worked with Chandler Post and Wilhelm Koehler on the sculpture of Chartres Cathedral. He returned to Williams to teach art history in 1938, and, except a brief hiatus when he served in the Navy during World War II, taught at Williams for the rest of his career. In 1966, Stoddard authored what soon became the standard textbook for the study of medieval art, Monastery and Cathedral in France (later Art and Architecture in Medieval France). Yet Stoddard prioritized his undergraduate teaching throughout his career at Williams. Alongside colleagues S. Lane Faison and William Pierson, Jr., he trained a new generation of art history students at Williams for careers as art historians and museum curators. Collectively known as the Williams Art Mafia, these included Earl A. Powell III of the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, Glenn D. Lowry of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, James N. Wood of the Art Institute of Chicago and the J. Paul Getty Trust and Thomas Krens of the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Under his leadership, the Williams art history program developed into one of the finest undergraduate curricula in the country. In 1989, the College Art Association honored him with a Distinguished Teaching Award. To thank him for his pioneering work on St. Gilles and St. Trophime cathedrals, the French city of Arles gave him the honorary key to their city. Stoddard died, aged 90, in Williamstown, Massachusetts."

  "text" : "Warren Hill (June 1960 – January 27, 2015) was a prisoner executed in Georgia in the United States. Hill was originally sentenced to life imprisonment for shooting his girlfriend, Myra Wright, in 1985. He was subsequently sentenced to death for killing his cellmate, Joseph Handspike. In 1990 Hill killed Handspike in their cell by bludgeoning him to death with a wooden board studded with nails. His execution by lethal injection, scheduled for July 15, 2013, was postponed due to a legal challenge against Georgia's Lethal Injection Secrecy Act. This law, passed in March 2013, makes the identities of companies and individuals who make and supply lethal injection drugs, and the identities of the doctors hired by the state to oversee executions, a “state secret” that must be shielded from disclosure to the public, the media, and even the judiciary. Hill's lawyers argued that this would prevent Hill from knowing whether the execution would be carried out by competent personnel using properly formulated drugs. The secrecy regime was ultimately upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court. There was also controversy as to whether or not Hill qualified as being mentally disabled, a designation that would have precluded him from being executed. On this basis of his mental capabilities the European Union had appealed several times to the Georgia Chairman of the Board of Pardons and Paroles and Georgia Governor Nathan Deal to prevent Hill from being executed. Hill was executed on January 27, 2015."

  "text" : "William Leavitt (born 1941) is a conceptual artist known for paintings, photographs, installations, and performance works that examine \"the vernacular culture of L.A. through the filter of the entertainment industry...drawing on 'stock environments' and designs of films as well as the literature of the place.\" A critical figure in the West Coast conceptual art movement of the late 60s, Leavitt himself has managed to maintain a low profile. \"Over the last 40 years, William Leavitt has made a name for himself as an influential artist while staying so far out of fame's spotlight that his hard-to-categorize works have been all but invisible to the public,\" wrote the LA Times. While his work is collected by high profile artists such as John Baldessari and Mike Kelley (who donated Leavitt works to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles), Leavitt himself has eschewed celebrity. Leavitt received a BFA from University of Colorado, Boulder and a MFA from Claremont Graduate School. Since moving to Los Angeles in 1965 his work evolved, increasingly referencing themes endemic to the city such as the line between reality and fantasy and the nature of illusion. Leavitt is a contemporary to artists like Allen Ruppersberg, Bruce Nauman, Ed Ruscha, John Baldessari, Bas Jan Ader, Guy de Cointet, and William Wegman, a generation that \"distinguished their work from most melancholic Minimal/Conceptual art made in New York and Europe by using deadpan humor, slapstick comedy and the cliche as a way to, as Baldessari put it, 'take conceptual art off of its pedestal, so to speak.'\" Leavitt was given a significant survey exhibition by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 2011, titled Theater Objects. Despite Leavitt's long history of exhibitions in New York, Los Angeles, and abroad, the Theater Objects retrospective was described as \"a revelation\" by art critic Christopher Knight."

In the final she nipped Jessica Judd at the line to take the silver medal behind the favourite Ajee' Wilson. The sixteen-year-old Wang set a personal best of 2:01.34 minutes to win at the China City Games junior competition – this was the fastest run by a Chinese athlete in over five years and the best by a Chinese youth since Ma Junren-trained Lin Na ran at the 1997 Chinese Games. Chunyu competed exclusively on the national circuit in 2012 and her best run of the season came at the Chinese Athletics Championships, where she was just two hundredths of a second behind Zhao Jing, with a time of 2:01.48 minutes.

  "text" : "William Archer (1820–1874) was an Australian architect, naturalist, grazier, politician and member of the prominent Archer family. He was the second son of Thomas Archer, a prominent pastoralist and politician himself. A keen interest in architecture led to him going to London to study architecture when he finished school, where he studied under William Rogers and Robert Stephenson. During his life he built many colonial buildings across Tasmania, served as a member of both the Tasmanian House of Assembly and Tasmanian Legislative Council and made significant contributions to botany, with several native Tasmanian plants named after him. Despite this he died penniless at his brothers house Fairfield on 15 October 1874."

  "text" : "William Meschin (sometimes William le Meschin; died between 1130 and 1135) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and baron. Meschin was the brother of Ranulf le Meschin, the Earl of Chester. They were the sons of Ranulf de Briquessart, the viscount of the Bessin, and his wife, Matilda, the daughter of Richard le Goz, viscount of Avranches. The boys were also nephews of Hugh d'Avranches, who was Earl of Chester. There was also an older brother, Richard, who died young, and a sister, who married Robert de Grandmesnil. Meschin went on the First Crusade and was present at the Siege of Nicaea in 1097. Meschin was given Gilsland by his brother, in order to protect the approaches to Carlisle. Due to attacks by the Scots, Meschin was unable to hold it. In compensation, King Henry I of England gave him lands around Allerdale in Cumberland, which centred on Egremont. These lands comprised the lordship, or Barony of Egremont. Through his wife, he acquired Skipton, and the lordship, or Barony of Skipton. Besides these lands, Meschin also was awarded two escheated properties in Leicestershire, some of which had earlier been lands of Roger de Busli. Other properties in Leicestershire were previously held by Durand Malet and William Blund in the Domesday Book. Meschin also held lands in Lincolnshire and Cheshire from his brother. Meschin built the original parts of Egremont Castle at Egremont. It was a motte-and-bailey stone castle on the River Ehen. He and his wife also founded the Augustinian priory of Embsay Priory. Katrina Legg argues that Meschin's main motive for the foundation was to show support for a monastic order that enjoyed the patronage of King Henry I. Against this, Legg feels that Meschin's wife's motives were more probably religious, as she was close to Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Another religious foundation of Meschin's was St Bees Priory, a daughter house of St Mary's Abbey, York. St Bees was founded around the same time as Embsay, Embsay was founded between 1120 and 1121, and St Bees was founded sometime after 1120. Meschin married Cecily, daughter of Robert de Rumily. They had one son, Ranulf Meschin, and three daughters, Alice, Avice, and Matilda. Another son, Matthew, who was the eldest son, died before his parents. Meschin died between 1130 and 1135. His widow married Henry de Tracy, and she died around 1151. Skipton went to Alice, who married William fitzDuncan. Alice and her first husband also acquired Egremont, after the death of her brother Ranulf without heirs. After the death of fitzDuncan, Alice married Alexander fitzGerold. Avice married William de Courcy. Avice married as her second husband William Paynel, son of Ralph Paynel, as his second wife. Before 1153 Avice had married as her third husband Walter, the son of Alan de Percy. Matilda married twice – first to Philip de Belmeis and second to Hugh de Mortimer. All three daughters were the eventual co-heirs of their father, after their brother died without offspring between 1135 and 1140. Meschin's lands were divided between their descendants, with parts ending up with the Counts of Aumale, the family of the Courcys, and the last and smallest part to the Mortimer family."

  "text" : "Wenzel Krumpholz, or Václav Krumpholz (born at Zlonice, near Prague in 1750, died Vienna May 2, 1817), was a musician who played mandolin and violin. He studied the mandolin at an early age and became one of the most renowned performers on this instrument. At a later date he adopted the violin also, for in 1796 he was one of the first violins in the orchestra of the Court Opera, Vienna. Krumpholz was the son of a bandmaster in a French regiment who lived in Paris during childhood, learning music from his father. His brother, Johann Baptist Krumpholz, was also a musician, a celebrated harpist and composer. According to music historian Philip J. Bone, there was a strong friendship between Wenzel Krumpholz and Ludwig van Beethoven. Bone talked about the relationship between Krumpholz and Beethoven in his book The Guitar and Mandolin. He said that Krumpholz's name was \"immortalized by his intimacy with Beethoven, who was exceedingly fond of him, and who used to jokingly call him mein Narr (my fool).\" He talked about what men in the music business had to say about the Beethoven-Krumpholz friendship: according to Ferdinand Ries, Krumpholz gave Beethoven instruction on the violin when in Vienna and it is most probable that he gave instruction on the mandolin. Carl Czerny said in his autobiography that it was Krumpholz who had introduced him to Beethoven, and that Krumpholz was one of the first to recognize Beethoven's genius and inspired others with his own enthusiasm. Bone said that Krumpholz frequently played the mandolin to Beethoven and indicated that it influenced Beethoven to write music for the mandolin. He talked about research done by Dominco Artaria, who had bought a Skizzenbook, containing sketches of some of Beethoven's music. Artaria stated in his Aittographische Skizze that Beethoven intended to write a sonata for mandolin and pianoforte for Krumpholz. This composition is the one sketched in Beethoven's note book (preserved as (No. 29,801) in the manuscript department of the British Museum) and it was first made public by Breitkopf and Hartel, Leipzig. On the day following Krumpholz's death, Beethoven composed the Gesang der Mönche from Schiller's William Tell, for three men's voices \"in commemoration of the sudden and unexpected death of our Krumpholz\". Only two of Krumpholz's compositions were printed. He taught Jean-Joseph Benoit Pollet the mandolin. That same student learned harp from his brother Jean-Baptiste Krumpholz."

Till's murder was a watershed moment in the African-American Civil Rights Movement. Louis testified in court about what he had seen, but an all-white jury found the men not guilty. Fearing for his life, Louis moved to Chicago after the trial and changed his name from Willie Reed to Willie Louis.

He supported a radical plan in which workers in an industry would take one third of the profits, the other thirds going to capital and the public. By the end of his tenure the Brotherhood controlled investments worth over $100 million."

  "text" : "Wendy A. Tadros was the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSBC) Chairperson from 2006 to 2014. Since at least 1995, she had been a board member. As chairperson, Tadros was a senior appointee of the Government of Canada, and was responsible for accident investigations that may or may not have included fatalities, such as the tragedy of Lac-Megantic, of which Tadros stated that the \"investigation will take months,\" and warned against blaming the Lac-Megantic tragedy on one person. She was quoted as saying that the Lac-Megantic derailment \"may well be the most devastating rail accident in Canadian history.” She frequently appeared before legislators in Parliament in Ottawa. A statement of the duties of the TSBC was provided by her on 13 June 2006 to the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. She has been aware since at least 1995 of the problems of DOT-111 tank cars, and wrote in committee at the time that \"the tank cars that lost product were all Class 111A cars, a class known to be susceptible to product loss at derailment.\" She returned to the subject of the DOT-111 tank cars in the investigation of a derailment near River Glade, New Brunswick when she wrote in committee that \"Class 111A tank cars are more susceptible to release product upon derailment and impact than pressure tank cars, and yet there are a number of toxic and volatile liquids that are still permitted to be carried in minimum standard Class 111A tank cars.\" She noted a failure of the safety regulations for the Transport of Dangerous Goods (TDG) in report R02W0063, issued 2004, that \"Since the train originated and would have terminated in Canada, and the DG products were not listed in Schedule I of the TDG regulations, neither the shipper nor CN was required to have an emergency response plan.\""

  "text" : "William Donati is a biographer and academic. He holds four university degrees in literature, including a PhD in English. Donati gained national attention when he charged that author Charles Higham committed literary fraud in his book about actor Errol Flynn. Higham’s Errol Flynn: The Untold Story (Doubleday 1980) claimed that Flynn had been a spy for Germany and was involved in the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Donati investigated the controversy and accused Higham of altering a government surveillance document in the paperback version to make it appear that Flynn had been identified as a Nazi spy, as reported in the Los Angeles Times.  Donati co-authored My Days With Errol Flynn (Roundtable 1988), the autobiography of stuntman Buster Wiles, Flynn’s close friend, and his research on Higham’s claims appears in a section of the book. Donati and Wiles were guests on Geraldo in a segment about Errol Flynn, Cary Grant, and Richard Burton. Donati is also the author of Ida Lupino: A Biography. The biography was recognized as a realistic account with documentation: “We have only to read on to see that so much of what led to an extraordinary career will be gnawed at by inner turmoil, alcohol and decades of being one’s own worst enemy.” He also wrote Lucky Luciano: The Rise and Fall of a Mob Boss (McFarland 2010) He examined over 40,000 archival documents, and presented “Lucky’s world of drugs, gambling, prostitution, and gang rival killings\". The biography has a strong anti-gangster tone that criticized the underworld and praised special prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey. Donati's most recent book is The Life and Death of Thelma Todd (McFarland 2012). Donati appeared in an episode of \"Hollywood Mysteries and Scandals\" in 1998 examining Todd’s 1935 death, which remains one of Hollywood’s most enduring unsolved mysteries. Hot Toddy by Andy Edmonds asserted the actress had been murdered by Lucky Luciano, a claim Donati disputes. Arts writer Thomas Gladysz listed it as one of the Best Film Books of 2012."

  "text" : "William Brede Kristensen (21 June 1867 in Kristiansand – 25 September 1953 in Leiden) was a Norwegian historian of religion. Kristensen completed secondary school in 1884. For a short while he studied theology, but from the fall of 1887 he concentrated on history of religion, first in Kristiania, later (1890–92) at Leiden University under Professor Cornelis Petrus Tiele and 1892–93 in Paris under Gaston Maspero. In 1896 he received his Doctor Philosophiae from the University of Kristiania on a thesis titled The Egyptians' Conceptions of Life after Death in Relation to the Gods Ra and Osiris (Ægypternes Forestillinger om Liv efter Døden i Forbindelse med Guderne Ra og Osiris). Kristensen was granted a scholarship, combined with the duty of giving lectures at University of Kristiania in 1898. In 1901 he became the successor of Professor Tiele in history of religion and Phenomenology of religion at Leiden University, a professorship he held until his retirement in 1937.Kristensen can be seen as the anchorman of Dutch Phenomenology of religion. Kristensen argues that phenomenology seeks the “meaning” of religious phenomena. Kristensen clarifies this supposition by defining the meaning that his phenomenology is seeking as “the meaning that the religious phenomena have for the believers themselves”."

  "text" : "William McMurtrie (March 10, 1851 – May 14, 1913) was an American chemist. Born on a farm near Belvidere, New Jersey, the son of Abram McMurtrie and Almira Smith, William matriculated to Lafayette College where he graduated with a mining engineer degree in 1871—the school did not then offer a degree program in chemistry, his primary interest. He undertook graduate studies at the College during 1871–1872 and was appointed as an assistant chemist with the United States Department of Agriculture. In 1873, he was named Chief Chemist for the department; a post he would hold until 1878. He was awarded a Ph.D. from Lafayette in 1875—the first doctorate in chemistry awarded at the school. On April 5, 1876 he was married to Helen Douglass and the couple would have two children. Dr. McMurtrie traveled to the Paris Exposition in 1878 as representative of the Department of Agriculture. He became a special agent of the Department in 1879, collecting information regarding agricultural technology. The following year, he served as a representative for the commissioner of agriculture at an international exhibit in Philadelphia for sheep, wool, and wool products. Published in 1880, his Report on the culture of the sugar beet and the manufacture of sugar therefrom in France and the United States helped to launch the sugar beet industry in the United States. From 1882 until 1888, Dr. McMurtrie was professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois. In 1884, he was named chemist for the Illinois State Board of Agriculture, then become chemist for the Illinois Agricultural Station in 1886. He entered the commercial sphere in 1888 when he moved to New York to work as chemist for the New York Tartar Company. In 1896, Dr. McMurtrie was chosen vice president of the chemistry section for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was selected president of the American Chemical Society in 1900. He served as a trustee for Lafayette College from 1906 until 1912. During his career he was the author of numerous reports prepared for the U.S. Department of Agriculture."

  "text" : "William Davies, FGS (13 July 1814 – 13 February 1891) was a British palaeontologist. Davies was born on 13 July 1814 at Holywell, Flintshire. His father was Thomas Davies and his mother was Elizabeth Turner. He studied botany and in 1843 began work at the Geology Department of the British Museum, first also in the field of mineralogy, later specialising in vertebrate palaeontology. On 1 April 1846 he joint the Survey as a Fossil Collector. Davies assisted Sir Antonio Brady in his work on collecting Pleistocene mammal fossils, and Brady acknowledged his debt to Davies in Catalogue of Pleistocene Mammalia from Ilford, Essex (1874). Excavating a large mammoth skull, Davies used the innovation of surrounding the fossil, in the field, with plaster of Paris, reinforced by iron bars. In 1874 he salvaged the Dacentrurus holotype. Davies was awarded the inaugural Murchison Medal from the Geological Society of London in 1873, and was made a fellow (FGS) in 1877. In 1875 he was made an Assistant, responsible for the entire fossil collection of the museum, and in 1880 was promoted Assistant First Class. In 1880, Davies supervised the transfer of the museum's collections to new buildings in the Natural History Museum. Davies was very active in the collecting and mounting of fish fossils. He trained the fish expert Arthur Smith Woodward. Davies during his life published fifteen scientific papers. The dinosaur Thecospondylus daviesi was named after him. Davies retired in 1887, and died at his home at Labdens, Colliers End, Hertford, on 13 February 1891. Even after his retirement he remained active in the field and proofread many palaeontological publications. He had married twice, and had two children (a son and daughter) by his first wife. His son, Thomas Davies (1837–1891), became a mineralogist, editor of the Mineralogical Magazine, and like his father worked at the British Museum. It was said of William Davies that: \"his extensive knowledge was ever at the service of others, for he was one of those men who cared more for the advancement of science than of himself.\""

William Collard Smith, (19 July 1830 – 20 October 1894) was a politician in colonial Victoria (Australia), member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly and Minister of Education 1880 to 1881. Smith was youngest son of William Smith, manager of a large cotton factory at Bollington, in Cheshire, England, where he was born. He emigrated to Victoria in 1852, and ultimately settled at Ballarat, of which he was Mayor. Identifying himself with the mining interest, he began to acquire that ascendency in the local politics of the goldfields' city, which he for many years maintained. Smith was returned to the Legislative Assembly in August 1861 for Ballarat West, in conjunction with the ex-Premier of Victoria, Duncan Gillies, and after a brief retirement stood again in 1871, when he was returned, and represented the constituency without intermission till April 1892, when he was defeated. Lieut.-Colonel Smith, who holds that rank in the local forces, early identified himself with the volunteer movement, and distinguished himself in Parliament by his mastery of the Local Government question. He was Minister of Mines in Graham Berry's first Government from August to October 1875, and held the same office in conjunction with that of Minister of Education in Berry's second Cabinet from May 1877 to March 1880. He also acted as Treasurer of Victoria during his chief's absence in England on the famous \"Embassy\" from December 1878 to November 1879. In Berry's third Administration Colonel Smith was Minister of Education from August 1880 to July 1881. He was one of the delegates to the Federation Convention held in Sydney in March 1891, and the next year lost his seat for Ballarat West. In September 1894 Smith was again elected for Ballarat West, but died soon afterward."

An enthusiast of anthroposophy he published a lecture Musikalische Betrachtungen in geisteswissenschaftlichem Sinn in Berlin in 1917, which were in the main well received by Rudolf Steiner himself. He was in January 1919 the first editor of Der Weg a short-lived monthly magazine \"for Art, Literature and Music\" which was the most progressive voice for art in Munich in the immediate post war. The editorship passed to the writer Eduard Trautner and the artist Hans Theodor Joel after the third issue, and then the magazine ceased with the eighth issue.

He is responsible for much of the foundation of the structural and institutional infrastructure of today's Roman Catholic Church in Paterson, New Jersey. To the end of his 93 years, a simple parish priest and caring steward of his flock, he refused the Pope's appointment of him as a Domestic prelate and, even, the then powerful Ku Klux Klan could not intimidate this beloved priest's honored 1922 burial. Father \"Mac\" as he was affectionately known in Paterson was so revered by its Irish and German Roman Catholic communities that his mere admonishing appearance in midst of Passaic County's 1880 Garret Rock May Day Riot or what national newspaper coverage of the time called \"the most serious riot that has ever occurred in that section of the country\" was sufficient to permit police to thereafter act to end the rioting. During his lifetime, the Pope, anyway, accorded this truly Reverend Father the extraordinary honor of naming him to the office of Papal chamberlain, which office is normally the reserve of European nobility. Father McNulty lies in front of Paterson's St. John's Church under an honoring bronze monument of his counseling a parish youth."

MacGregor is best known as the first performer of Paul Hindemith's Ludus tonalis (1943, Chicago), he also played Hindemith's Sonata for Piano Four Hands together with the author. In 1944 during Igor Stravinsky's American tour MacGregor played his Concerto for Two Pianos together with the composer. His records of 1950s include different pieces by Beethoven, Franz Schubert and Debussy. MacGregor's painting has been exhibited in New York City, Chicago, Newark and other cities throughout the USA. The Virgin Islands Daily News pointed out that \"MacGregor shows the same vigor, warmth and professional technique in his music as he does in his painting\"."

Educated to secondary school level, Hutchinson became active in the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and was first elected to its Executive Council in 1913. The following year, he was also elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, becoming its chairman in 1920. He stood for the party in Bolton at the 1924 general election, but was not successful. Unusually for a trade union official, Hutchinson was a supporter of guild socialism, and was close to G. D. H. Cole and the Fabian Society. In 1925, Hutchinson was elected to London County Council in Woolwich East, although he did not defend his seat at the following election. From 1930 to 1933, he was President of the renamed Amalgamated Engineering Union, and he served the union until his retirement in 1943. He then briefly worked as an organiser for the Industrial Orthopaedic Society, before retiring fully in 1946."

  "text" : "William Walton (1706–1768) was the son of Captain William and Mary (Santford) Walton. He followed his father into the shipping and mercantile business and became a prominent figure in the colony of New York, serving as a member of the New York General Assembly (1751–58) and of the Governor's Council (1758–68). He was one of the founders and a trustee of the New York Society Library and a member of the Board of Trade from 1758 until his death in 1768. The family of William Walton acquired its fortune in part through an advantageous contract to furnish provisions and supplies to the Spaniards at St. Augustine, Florida. His father, the captain, was an enterprising builder of vessels, as well as a shipper of goods, and appears also to have sailed his own vessels on trading voyages to the West Indies and to the Spanish Main. William the son married Cornelia, daughter of Dr. William Beekman and Catharine Peters de la Noy, on January 27, 1731. His brother Jacob had, five years previously, married Maria, the sister of Dr. William Beekman, and daughter of Gerard Beekman and Magdalen Abeel. The two brothers were in partnership until the death of Jacob, in 1749. A son of the latter, whose name was William also, became the favorite and heir of the uncle. It was he, the younger William Walton, who in 1757, married the daughter of Lt. Governor De Lancey, whose fortune was equal to his own. William Walton the elder was genial and a brilliant conversationalist. Dining was his principal pleasure, and he entertained many important personages from Europe when they visited New York.He was regarded as the first merchant of his time, and as a prominent legislator and an honored counselor. He died childless in 1768."

  "text" : "Wioletta Grzegorzewska, Wioletta Greg (9 February 1974) is a Polish poet and writer, born in a small village Rzeniszów in Jurassic Highland in Poland. In 2006, she left her country and moved to the Isle of Wight. She lives in Essex. Wioletta spent ten years in Czestochowa where she organised cultural events, edited student journals, wrote articles about local literary developments. Between 1998 – 2012 she published six poetry volumes, as well as a novella Guguły, in which she's covering her childhood and the experience of growing up in Communist Poland. Senior editor Max Porter from Portobello Books said: Guguły is an enchanting and intriguing book. Wioletta Greg is a poet and every line of this haunting autobiographical novella has its own weird, beautiful atmosphere. It reminded me of Evie Wyld, Ludmila Petrushevskaya and Herta Muller.\" Greg's short stories and poems have been published in: Asymptote, The Guardian, Litro Magazine, Poetry Wales, Wasafiri, The White Review. Her poetry book Finite Formulae & Theories of Chance has been shortlisted for the 2015 Griffin Poetry Prize. The judges said: \"These poems, as translated from Polish into English by Marek Kazmierski, retain the force of first experience and, equally, a collection of history’s remains. Greg’s thoughts include the catastrophe of the 20th century whose marks still wobble before her eyes, and the experience of living in post-Communist Poland. This stunning collection shows us (mostly through the eyes and memories of childhood) a world of objects transported across years. ‘Tossing satin bulbs into wicker baskets,’ the child poet is at ease with the earth and the hardy objects made from it. Greg grants us the privilege of seeing what she saw before she saw more.\" Wioletta has won The Goldene Eule 2015 in Vienna. In 2012 an Arts Council-funded audio recording project of the British Library, Between Two Worlds: Poetry and Translation, recorded her poetry. Her poems have been translated into English by Marek Kazmierski, Anna Hyde, Catalan  by Xavier Farre and Welsh."

After her business took off she opened a wholesale bakery in New York City that specialized in cookies. In 1995 she had to close her business suddenly to care for her oldest daughter Ruby suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident. After her daughter's recovery she and her husband Michael Davidson opened Ruby et Violette, a gourmet cookie shop in June 2001. It became renown for its extensive variety of chocolate chip cookies. Five percent of her net profits from sales of cookies went to the Mount Sinai traumatic brain injury unit, where her daughter had been treated. She sold the bakery in 2006.Soon after she began writing a memoir about helping her oldest daughter recover from a traumatic brain injury. Retelling the devastating event uncovered many of her own travails as a child, wife, mother and entrepreneur. Mom, I Want To Speak to Marie Antoinette: A Story About Traumatic Brain Injury, Abuse, Death, Divorce, Love & Laughter was published in 2013. It was agented by Dystel and Goderich Literary Management. She became a contributing writer to The Huffington Post in October 2013."

  "text" : "William Nobles (December 23, 1892 – November 24, 1968) was a cinematographer on nearly two-hundred Hollywood films in a career that spanned five decades, from 1917 to 1966. His most noted work is probably the Gene Autry film Red River Valley in 1936, and the original Dick Tracy serial film in 1937, working with Edgar Lyons. One author described his contribution to filmmaking as follows: Responsible for Republic's first 20 serials behind the camera was first-rate innovator William Nobles. In collaboration with Edgar Lyons (on the first six) and working solo (for the next fourteen) the former Mascot associate of Nat Levine was one of the best action and Western lensmen in the business. His photographic polish and technique in filming the hectic and furious work of Yak Canutt and company, gained him the reputation of being a major factor in lifting Republic's Westerns and serials far above the quality of its contemporaries, making it the leader in those areas for the next fifteen years. Another notes the \"fine photography\" by Nobles in The Fighting Devil Dogs, 1938. Nobles was born in Waubay, South Dakota, and died in Costa Mesa, California, at the age of 75."

  "text" : "William de Whithurst (died after 1350) was an English Crown official, who held office as a judge in Ireland. He appears to have been a native of Gloucester, where he held lands as a tenant of William de Holyns. He was a clerk in the Chancery by the mid 1320s, and he was said to have given \"long and faithful service\" to the Crown. The best evidence for his activities before 1346 lies in two petitions dating apparently from 1331. William petitioned the King for relief against being distrained by the Exchequer for debts owed to the Crown by the late Earl of Kent, the King's uncle, of whose property he had been appointed Keeper, claiming that he had a letter under the Privy Seal discharging him from liability for the debt; an endorsement on the petition shows that this plea was accepted. He also petitioned to be cleared of liability for a sum of £100 given to him by the late King Edward II, during the conflict which led to King Edward's final downfall in 1327, to pay the wages of the soldiers at Gloucester, on the ground that he could produce no written evidence as to whether or not the wages had actually been paid, since he had given the money to one Simon de Reading. In 1346, in consideration of his good service, King Edward III appointed him Master of the Rolls in Ireland; he served until about 1350 when he returned to England to become the parish priest of Brixham, Devon. The Patent Rolls for 1349 record a debt of forty shillings owed to him by William de Wode, which was to be levied in Northampton."

He was arrested on 15 April 2014 and was sent to Alhair \"political prison\" while prosecution. On July 6, 2014, Abulkhair was sentenced to 15 years in prison by the Specialized Criminal Court, (10 years executed and five suspended) and travel ban for another 15-year in addition to a fine of 200 thousand riyals. On 12 January 2015 the case returned from the Court of Appeal, after the judge requested increasing the previous judgment because AbuAlkhair refused to apologize. Thus, the judgment was tightened to 15-year executed. Abulkhair prayed for God’s victory and insisted not to recognize the court and the legitimacy of the SCC. Abulkhair is still in prison in the Capital of Saudi Arabia far away from his hometown in Jeddah."

  "text" : "Wulfad (died 876) was the archbishop of Bourges from 866 until his death. Prior to that, he was the abbot of Montier-en-Der (from 856) and Soissons (from 858). He also served as a tutor to Carloman, a younger son of King Charles the Bald. Carloman succeeded Wulfad as abbot of Soissons in 860. Wulfad was ordained a priest by Archbishop Ebbo of Reims, who had been deposed in 835 and re-instated in 840. Wulfad was ordained during Ebbo's second incumbency, which ended in 841. He may have served the anti-king Pippin II of Aquitaine, an opponent of Charles the Bald, as a notary during 847–48, a period in which support for Pippin reached a high. In 857, Charles tried to promote him to the vacant see of Langres, but was successfully blocked by Ebbo's successor, Hincmar. In 859, Wulfad was removed from his priestly office, along with all the other priests, deacons and subdeacons ordained by Ebbo, at the synod of Savonnières, held under Hincmar's presidency. Neither Wulfad's support for Pippin nor his defrocking by Hincmar deterred Charles the Bald from appointing him archbishop of Bourges in 866. He had probably supported the king during the Neustrian rebellions of 858–60, for in a charter of 859 Charles calls him \"our dearest abbot and minister\". Although Hincmar disputed Wulfad's eligibility for the episcopate, the synod held at Soissons in August 866 refused to adjudicate the case. In 868 Charles convinced Pope Nicholas I that Wulfad's \"prudence and vigour\" were needed to counter the Vikings that threatened the region around Bourges. The pope confirmed him in the see. In Wulfad's day, all books were copied by hand, thus friends lent books to friends to allow them to copy them out for their own libraries. A list of books in Wulfad's library, probably intended to circulate among his friends, has survived on the back of a manuscript copy of the philosopher John Scotus Eriugena's Ambigua. Wulfad was a close associate of Eriugena, who dedicated to him his Periphyseon and called him a \"collaborator in philosophical disputes\". Wulfad's list of books includes titles by Eriugena, including the latter's translations of Pseudo-Dionysius and Maximus the Confessor's Ad Thalassium. There is a poem preserved in the manuscript F. 67 in the Leiden Universiteitsbibliothek that preserves a poem addressed to Wulfad by a monk suffering from the cold while his fellow monk, Wulfad's former student, Carloman, was by a warm fire."

Upon the death of his father in 1896, he became the Earl of Limerick. He held the office of Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Limerick.

  "text" : "Will Viharo is an East Bay/Seattle-based author who has published nine novels. Seven of his novels are neo-noir (or neo-pulp ) works which blend elements of surrealism, gore, violent sex, and horror. His body of writing includes the Vic Valentine series (Love Stories Are Too Violent For Me, Fate Is My Pimp/Romance Takes A Raincheck, and I Lost My Heart In Hollywood/Diary of a Dick), Lavender Blonde, and Down A Dark Alley. Love Stories Are Too Violent For Me, originally published by Wild Card Press in 1993, was republished in August 2013 by Gutter Press, in anticipation of the movie adaption, which Christian Slater will direct and star in. Viharo, who was born in New York City on April 2, 1963, has also written two supernatural horror works: A Mermaid Drowns in the Midnight Lounge and Freaks That Carry Your Luggage Up To Your Room. From 1997 to 2012, Viharo, under the name Will the Thrill, regularly hosted Thrillville, a series of B-movie showings, with his wife Monica \"the Tiki Goddess\" Cortes Viharo. The locations of these stagings included the Parkway Speakeasy Theater in Oakland, California, which closed in 2009; the Cerrito Theater in El Cerrito, California (now operating under different management); and the Roxie Theater in San Francisco. Viharo's parents named him after William Shakespeare. His mother is a former beauty queen, and his father, Robert Viharo, a B-movie actor. In April 2014, Viharo and his wife, Monica Cortes Viharo - a college professor - moved from Alameda, California to Seattle, Washington. On July 24, 2015, Viharo's The Space Needler's Intergalactic Bar Guide, an erotic science fiction book co-authored with Scott Fulks, was published. In a March 2014 interview, Viharo stated that he was working on short stories - \"an unusual form\" for him - and would soon be finishing his sixth Vic Valentine novel, then (publicly) untitled. On November 29, 2015, that novel (titled Hard-Boiled Heart) was published. Just prior this period, actor Christian Slater—who had begun in earnest to adapt Love Stories Are Too Violent For Me for the silver screen—was side-tracked by the success of his first-season television show Mr. Robot."

In World War II, as a brigadier, he commanded the first force deployed in the New Guinea Campaign, Australia's most important military campaign. During this campaign, he opposed elements of Australian military policy, and his name was omitted from the official Australian history of the New Guinea Campaign. In civilian life he founded Australian engineering firm WE Smith Marine and General Engineer in 1922 (later WE Smith Engineering Pty Ltd) which he managed continuously – except for the period during World War II that he undertook full-time military service – until his retirement in the 1970s."

He was appointed Keeper of the Royal Wardrobe in 1320, and was later employed abroad on royal business. He was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1331 but served in that office only for a few months: he quickly returned to England and was sitting on a Royal Commission there at the end of the year. He retained some links with Ireland, becoming a prebendary in the Diocese of Ossory in 1332. He went abroad on official business with Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham in 1336. He became vicar of Stanhope, County Durham and warden of Grantham Hospital. He seems to have spent much of his later years in York, and in 1357 he was given permission to found a guild in the city, with himself as one of the fraternity."

  "text" : "Walter Poenisch (July 11, 1913 - June 6, 2000) was an American baker and long-distance swimmer. In 1963, at the age of 50, Poenisch began his professional swimming career by swimming in the Jim Moran Lake Michigan Swim, a 30-mile professional marathon swim in Lake Michigan. In June 1972, Poenisch tried to establish a long-distance ocean swimming record off of Florida but was pulled from the water after sharks attacked his safety cage. In 1976, he swam 125 miles in the Florida Straits and was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest ocean swim. To memorialize his 65th birthday in 1978, Poenisch set out to be the first to swim from Havana, Cuba to the Florida Keys. As then-President of Cuba Fidel Castro watched, Poenisch began his swim from Cuba on July 13, 1978. About thirty-three hours later, Poenisch arrived at Little Duck Key, a small island in the lower Florida Keys. As a result of not filing for official recognition - he had no outside observer beside his own personal crew - his swim did not receive official recognition. He subsequently sued three parties, including the International Swimming Hall of Fame and Diana Nyad, a long-distance swimmer competitor who began her first Cuba-to-Florida swim on July 16, 1978 - two days after Poenisch arrived in Florida. Poenisch claimed that Nyad's publicist and Nyad had slandered him just before she left on her swim due to how they characterized his Cuba-to-Florida swim efforts. Poenisch received $5,000 from each of the three parties in an out-of-court settlement five years later in April 1983. Poenisch died in June 2000 and, as of September 2013, has not received official recognition for his 1978 Cuba-to-Florida swim."

He authored several books, most notably Kinetic Architecture, with co-author Roger Clark, see Kinetic architecture; numerous experimental structural engineering articles; and many technical articles. During his years at UVA, he also served as research engineer for the Virginia Department of Transportation. The term kinetic architecture was coined by Zuk and Roger H. Clark in the early 1970s, when \"dynamic spatial design problems were explored in mechanical systems.\" (Zuk and Clark 1970)."

  "text" : "William H. Crook (October 15, 1839 – March 13, 1915) was one of President Abraham Lincoln's bodyguards in 1865. After Lincoln's assassination (while Crook was off duty), he continued to work in the White House for a total of over 50 years, serving 12 presidents. Even during the height of the American Civil War, presidential security was lax. Throngs of people entered the White House every day. \"The entrance doors and all the doors on the Pennsylvania side of the mansion were open at all hours of the day and, often, very late into the evening.\" Lincoln finally gave in to concerns for his safety in November 1864, and was assigned four around-the-clock bodyguards. When one was reassigned as the White House doorkeeper, Crook, then a member of the Washington Police Force and a former Union Army soldier, was selected as his replacement, beginning January 4, 1865. Lincoln's son Tad had a speech impediment and referred to Crook as \"Took\". When Crook was later drafted, he went to see the President, who arranged to keep his services. On April 14, 1865, Crook began his shift at 8 a.m. He was to have been relieved by John Frederick Parker at 4 p.m., but Parker was several hours late. Lincoln had told Crook that he had been having dreams of himself being assassinated for three straight nights. Crook tried to persuade the President not to attend a performance of the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theater that night, or at least allow him to go along as an extra bodyguard, but Lincoln said he had promised his wife they would go. As Lincoln left for the theater, he turned to Crook and said \"Goodbye, Crook.\" Before, Lincoln had always said, \"Good night, Crook.\" Crook later recalled: \"It was the first time that he neglected to say ‘Good Night’ to me and it was the only time that he ever said ‘Good-bye’. I thought of it at that moment and, a few hours later, when the news flashed over Washington that he had been shot, his last words were so burned into my being that they can never be forgotten.\" Crook blamed Parker, who had left his post at the theater without permission. Crook also served as a bodyguard for Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson. It was he who brought the news to the embattled President that he had been acquitted in his impeachment trial in May 1868. When good friend Ulysses S. Grant became President, he appointed Crook \"Executive Clerk of the President of the United States\" in 1870, and dispersing agent in 1877, the latter the position he would hold for the rest of his career. On January 5, 1915, President Woodrow Wilson and the members of the White House staff celebrated his 50 years of service and presented him with a cane. Crook set his memoirs down on paper in the book Through Five Administrations: Reminiscences of Colonel William H. Crook, Body-Guard to President Lincoln, compiled and edited by Margarita Spalding Gerry. There are actually six covered, from Lincoln to Chester A. Arthur, though James A. Garfield and Arthur are covered in a single chapter. William H. Crook died at his boarding house after being sick with pneumonia for more than a week. He was predeceased by his wife, Jane Catherine Rodbird (1846-1895). He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery; President Wilson attended the funeral."

Kinrade is one of the most significant writers of Manx carols (or ‘carvels’), in an era when these are now considered to be the only surviving source of literature in Manx. To him have been attributed a number of carvels, including the following: \n*  Lhig da’n slane seihll cur clashtyn / Let the whole world harken \n*  O uss vriw bioee as merriu / Thou judge of living and dead \n*  The Question-and-Answer carol. \n*  The Carol of Warning and Example to Young Men \n*  She corrym rish yn earish shoh \n*  Cre'n stayd va dooinney hoshiaght \n*  Carval Noah / Noah’s Carol \n*  Carval Susannah / Susannah’s Carol The majority of these carvels were most notably published in Carvalyn Gailkagh (Manx Carols) by A. W. Moore in 1891. However, ‘Lhig da’n slane seihll cur clashtyn‘ (‘Let the whole world harken’) had been published earlier, in 1870. It is believed that this carvel was sung to the tune of ‘Mish ta’n Billey Roauyr,’ as the tune’s title appears to be a corruption of the first line of the second verse: ‘T’eh mysh ny biljyn reurey‘ (‘He is digging about the trees’). A translation of Kinrade’s poetry has most recently appeared in Manannan’s Cloak: An Anthology of Manx Literature by Robert Corteen Carswell:"

  "text" : "Wilfred Lawrence Knox (21 May 1886 – 9 February 1950) was a Church of England clergyman and theologian. He was one of four brothers who distinguished themselves in different fields, the eldest a writer and editor, the second a classical scholar and wartime code-breaker, and the youngest a Roman Catholic theologian and priest. After leaving Oxford with a first-class honours degree in classics, Knox joined the civil service, left to work with the poor of London's East End, and then studied for ordination to the priesthood. He served only briefly in parish work, spending much of his life with the Oratory of the Good Shepherd, where he was warden from 1924 to 1940, and at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was chaplain and a fellow. A first-rate classical scholar, Knox approached his studies of the New Testament from the point of view of a Hellenist, and wrote several books on St Paul and other aspects of church history from the Hellenistic angle. He also wrote books explaining Anglo-Catholicism and others giving advice on how to follow the Christian way of life."

  "text" : "Willibald Nagel (19 June 1870 – 13 November 1911) was a German physiologist, best known for his work in the field of sensory physiology. Born in Tübingen, Nagel earned doctorates in sciences (1892) and medicine (1893), obtaining his habilitation two years later at the University of Freiburg as an assistant to physiologist Johannes von Kries. In 1902 he became an associate professor in Berlin, where he was appointed head of the sensory physiology department in the institute of physiology. In 1908 he was named professor of physiology at the University of Rostock. His primary areas of work involved physiological optics, physiology in regards to sense of smell and taste, studies of position and motion sensations and the physiology of the vocal organs, to name a few. He is best remembered for the development of ophthalmic instruments and aids—he built an adaptometer for measuring dark adaptation of the eyes, an anomaloscope for the study of color blindness, and introduced the so-called Nagelschen Farbtäfelchen (Nagel's color tablet) for the testing of color perception. With Hermann Ebbinghaus, he was co-editor of the journal Zeitschrift für psychologie und physiologie der sinnesorgane. He died in Rostock."

  "text" : "Dr William Stork (flourished 1751-, d. 1768) practiced as an oculist in England and the American colonies, and subsequently settled in the British colony of East Florida and published pamphlets encouraging its settlement. Some accounts state that he was initially from Germany, but do not provide primary references which prove the claim. Stork advertised in London in 1751 and 1752 that he was the oculist to the Princess of Wales. He then advertised his services as an oculist in Jamaica in 1760. He arrived in Philadelphia and advertised his services as an oculist in 1761. He travelled up and down the Eastern colonies from Annapolis to Boston between 1761 and 1764. From the diary of Dedham Massachusetts physician Nathaniel Ames, we know that Stork performed cataract couching. Stork is the first known to have performed cataract couching in the area that became the United States. The British acquired Florida from the Spanish by the treaty of 1763 which ended the Seven Years War (i.e. the French and Indian War). Stork made a career change in 1764, and decided to be a plantations agent in the colony of East Florida. Stork was in Florida in 1765, and traveled to England by 1766, when the first edition of his Florida journal was published. He then travelled back to Florida in 1767, and \"died with the fright\" during an insurrection of indentured servants in August 1768. His An Account of East Florida, written in English, was published in three editions, two in 1766, subtitled \"With Remark on its Future Importance to Trade and Commerce\" and a third in 1769, as A description of East-Florida, subtitled \"with a journal kept by John Bartram of Philadelphia, botanist to His Majesty for the Floridas : upon a journey from St. Augustine up the river St. John's, as far as the lakes : with explanatory botanical notes, illustrated with an accurate map of East-Florida, and two plans, one of St. Augustine, and the other of the Bay of Espiritu Santo\", the latter referring to St. Augustine, Florida, St. Johns River, the bay now known as Tampa Bay, and the botanist John Bartram. The book reputedly featured a plagiarised copy of a map by George Gauld, who wrote (speaking of himself in the third person): On the summer of 1765 he made an accurate survey of the Bay of Spiritu Santo, which soon appeared in William Stork's \"History of East Florida\" [sic]. How it happened to be published there we cannot pretend to say; but it is the only part of the many surreptitious sketches, which have been pirated from Mr. Gauld's works, that have been literally and pretty correctly copied' although there is an error of about 30 miles or more in Latittude. A manuscript work by John William Gerard de Brahm, in the library of Harvard University, listing the residents of East Florida up to 1771, refers to him as \"William Stork, Esq., historian\". The published work by de Brahm lists “Storck William Esqr.” as a Florida inhabitant between the years 1763 and 1771 “In the King’s Employ” under the category of “Draughtsmen” with the stated qualifications “Oculist, Physician”, with his status listed as “Dead.”"

In 1856 he replaced Adolf Morawek (1816-1855) as professor of the surgical clinic at the University of Würzburg. As a result of his work with the wounded in the Austro-Prussian War (1866), he was named Royal Bavarian Councillor in 1867. During the Franco-Prussian War, he distinguished himself in his role as a Bavarian general physician."

  "text" : "Walter Burton Harris (29 August 1866 – 4 April 1933) was a journalist, writer, traveller and socialite who achieved fame for his writings on Morocco, where he worked for many years as special correspondent for The Times. He settled in the country at the age of 19, eventually building himself a fine villa in Tangier where he lived for much of his life. His linguistic skills and physical appearance enabled him to pose successfully as a native Moroccan, travelling to parts of the country regarded as off-limits to foreigners. He wrote a number of well-regarded books and articles on his travels in Morocco and other countries in the Near and Far East. Harris also played a significant, though not always constructive, role in the European diplomatic intrigues that affected Morocco around the turn of the 20th century."

  "text" : "William Conroy (1857 – 18 November 1887) was the last person executed at the Perth Gaol. Conroy was convicted of murdering Fremantle Town Councillor John Snook. Conroy had immigrated from Ireland about ten years earlier, and before going to Fremantle was the licensee of the Victoria Hotel, located at the corner of James Street and Melbourne Road in Perth. On 6 September 1886 Conroy became the first publican of the new National Hotel on High Street in Fremantle. On 23 June 1887 Conroy went to the Fremantle Town Hall where there was a children's ball in progress. He demanded entrance, as he was a licensee of the National Hotel, but was told by Snook that only ladies and children were to be admitted. He persisted in his demands and finally the door was slammed on him. Conroy later gained admittance to the Town Hall. When Snook left the supper room, Conroy followed him, drew a revolver from his pocket, shot Snook and put the gun back in his pocket. Conroy was arrested immediately. Snook died three months later. The trial took place at Perth and he was sentenced to death on 7 October 1887. After he was sentenced a petition was raised and signed by approximately 1500 people, including all members of the jury who had at the time of passing the verdict asked the judge to be lenient. This was then given to Governor Broome. A further call to the governor for clemency occurred during a public meeting attend by 1,000 people at the Perth Town Hall. Governor Broome then reviewed the case with two judges and medical people who had previously been part of Conroy's trial, but the governor decided to let the law take it course. Conroy was hanged at Perth Gaol at 8 a.m. on 18 November 1887. The execution however was not swift as when Conroy was hanged the initial fall failed to break his neck and it took approximately 15 minutes for him to die of strangulation. Conroy was buried at Fremantle Cemetery."

  "text" : "Winifred Horrabin, née Batho (1887-1971), was a British socialist activist and journalist. She was born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, on 9 August 1887, daughter of Arthur John Batho, a postal telegraph clerk, and his wife Lilian, née Outram. She was the fourth of six children, three of whom died in infancy. The family were members of The Wicker Congregational Church. Her father died in May 1891, in Graaff-Reinet, South Africa, where he was seeking treatment for his tuberculosis. Winifred began attending the Sheffield School of Art in 1907, where she met her future husband, the political activist, cartographer and cartoonist Frank Horrabin. She had a political awakening while a student, influenced by the South African socialist and feminist Olive Schreiner. She joined the Women's Social and Political Union, a militant group campaigning for women's suffrage led by Emmeline Pankhurst, and in 1909 disrupted a speech by Winston Churchill with the suffragette cry \"Votes for women!\" She and Horrabin married on 11 August 1911, and they moved to London the same year. In 1912 she delivered a paper, \"Is Woman's Place the Home?\", to the Fabian Society, arguing that the liberation of women from economic slavery depended on the destruction of private property. She and her husband were involved in the Central Labour College, and in 1913 Winifred set up a Women's League to focus on the education of female workers. In 1915, inspired by the art of William Morris, she became a guild socialist. She was honorary secretary of The Plebs' League, and contributed to The Plebs, the League's journal, which her husband edited. She became a founder member of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1920. She and her husband collaborated on a book, Working Class Education, published in 1924. In 1926 she travelled to the Soviet Union, where she met N. K. Krupskaya and visited Lenin's tomb. Her trip appears to have been organised by the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR. She also visited Poland and witnessed a mass trial of political dissidents. In 1932 her brother Harold died from wounds sustained in the First World War, and she made an anti-war speech to the National Conference of Labour Women, arguing that the working classes should reject employment in munitions factories, even if it meant starvation. The Horrabins were involved in setting up the Socialist League, a left-wing faction within the Labour Party led by Stafford Cripps, in 1932, and it was Winifred who named it, after the original Socialist League, founded by William Morris. It took anti-war, anti-fascist and pro-nationalisation positions, but only lasted until 1937, when the Labour Party declared that membership was incompatible with membership of the Party. She began reviewing books and films for Tribune in 1937, continuing to do so until 1948. She also wrote for the political magazine Time and Tide and had a weekly column in the Manchester Evening News from 1944 under the pseudonym Freda Wynne. In 1938 her mother died, and she was diagnosed with an ovarian cyst, undergoing a hysterectomy the following year. Her husband, who had been having a long-term affair with his secretary, Margaret McWilliams, asked for a separation in 1942 and they divorced in 1947. In her later years she compiled a collection of autobiographical essays, The Summer of a Dormouse, and wrote a novel, After Which War?, but did not publish them. Other unpublished works included a play, Victorian Love Story: Beloved Good, about Thomas Carlyle and his wife Jane, and a biography of Olive Schreiner. She died at her home in Dorking, Surrey, on 24 June 1971, and was cremated at Randall's Park crematorium, Leatherhead, on 30 June. Her papers are held by the University of Hull."

Joerg, was born in Brooklyn, New York. A prodigy, Joerg graduated from the Brooklyn Polytechnic Preparatory School at the age of fourteen. He was fluent in many languages, and studied in Germany, at Thomas Gymnasium and the University of Leipzig, from 1901 to 1904, then studied geography and surveying at Columbia University for a year. After returning to Germany for a five year stint at the University of Göttingen in Germany, Joerg entered into employment with the American Geographical Society in 1911, where he would remain until 1937 when he left the Society to accept the post of Chief of the Division of Maps and Charts in the National Archives and Record Administration in Washington, D.C. Joerg was the first employee of the society to have had advanced university training in modern geography. Joerg published many books articles on geography, including volumes on the geography of the polar regions. Although he personally never travelled to the polar regions, he was considered to be the world's greatest expert on the geography of these regions. His early death was caused by a cerebral hemorrhage."

  "text" : "William Salkeld (1671–1715), legal writer, was the son of Samuel Salkeld of Fallowden, Northumberland, who died in 1699, and came of an ancient Cumberland family. He matriculated at St. Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 22 April 1687, at the age of fifteen. He entered himself as a student of the Middle Temple, 2 May 1692, and was called to the bar on 3 June 1698. He settled in Dorset on his marriage, in 1700, with Mary, only daughter and heiress of John Ryves of Fifehide Nevill in that county. He acquired a portion of that manor, disposing in 1707 of his paternal estate of Fallowden. Having in the meanwhile attained to a fair practice at the bar, Salkeld was in 1713 appointed Chief Justice of the Great Sessions for the counties of Carmarthen, Cardigan, and Pembroke. On 24 Jan. 1715 he became Serjeant-at-Law, and, in spite of the change of dynasty, he presided over the Carmarthen circuit until his death on 14 Sept. following. He was buried in the church of Fifehide Nevill, where a monument was erected to his memory. His widow died in 1723, aged 42, leaving three sons and three daughters. Serjeant Salkeld is best remembered as a diligent and painstaking law reporter, his Reports of Cases in the King's Bench, 1689–1712, published posthumously in 1717 and 1718, being the standing authority for that period. With others he translated into English the Reports of Sir Creswell Levinz in the King's Bench, 1660–1697, which appeared in 1722."

  "text" : "William Cleland Lowe (January 15, 1941 – October 19, 2013) was a visionary IBM Executive and is known as the \"Father of the IBM PC\". Mr. Lowe received a bachelor's degree in physics at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania in 1962 and joined IBM as a product test engineer. In 1975, he was named director of development and manufacturing operations for the General Systems Division in Atlanta, Georgia. In January 1977, he was appointed director of strategic development for GSD and, later that year, administrative assistant to the division's president. In January 1978, Mr. Lowe was named systems manager, Entry Level Systems Division, for GSD in Boca Raton, Florida, and in November, 1978, lab director for the site. In March 1981, he was appointed a vice president of the Information Systems Division and general manager of the IBM's Rochester, Minnesota, facility. In 1982, he became vice president for the System Products Division in White Plains, N.Y. and in 1983 was appointed assistant group executive for the Information Systems and Communications Group. Mr. Lowe returned to Entry Systems Division in March 1985 and served as ESD President through 1988. He was elected an IBM vice president in January 1986. In 1973, while an executive in General Systems Division, Mr. Lowe was instrumental in fostering an engineering prototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) created by Dr. Paul Friedl and a team at the IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center. SCAMP has been dubbed in PC Magazine as \"the world's first personal computer\"  and this seminal, single-user portable computer now resides in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC. A non-working industrial design model was also created in 1973 illustrating how the SCAMP engineering prototype could be transformed into a usable product design for the marketplace. The engineering prototype and design model were utilized internally by Mr. Lowe in his early efforts to demonstrate the viability of creating a single-user computer. Throughout the 1970s he continually demonstrated numerous single-user computer design concepts in an effort to convince IBM to enter the personal computer business. A selection of these early IBM industrial design concepts created in the infancy of personal computing is highlighted in the book DELETE: A Design History of Computer Vapourware. While the up-and-coming personal computer market potential had been studied and validated, Mr. Lowe determined IBM was unable to internally build a personal computer profitably and in a timely manner. When he spoke on the topic to the important Corporate Management Committee in July 1980, he said that to enter the market IBM needed to acquire another company \"because we can't do this within the culture of IBM\". The company Mr. Lowe suggested was Atari and he had an IBM industrial design model created using their existing Atari 800 platform to demonstrate the concept.  CEO Frank Carey had begun to encourage the creation of small, autonomous \"Independent Business Units\" (IBU) within IBM. Therefore, rather than acquiring Atari, the corporate committee allowed Mr. Lowe to form a group of 12 employees and requested a strategy for developing the product internally. The crude prototype they designed barely worked when Mr. Lowe demonstrated it to the committee in August, 1980 but he presented a detailed business plan that streamlined the development process by proposing an open architecture as well as non-proprietary components and software. Furthermore, the new PC product would be sold through retail stores. All these elements of Mr. Lowe's plan were contrary to IBM tradition. Consequently, the Corporate Management Committee gave approval to move forward and in 1980 Mr. Lowe designated a multi-disciplinary team under manager Don Estridge to develop and launch the new product. In order to move quickly they designed it from standard components and outsourced development of the operating system to Microsoft and the processor to Intel. Following Mr. Lowe's strategy, the IBM PC was developed in one year. It was launched in August, 1981 and sold far more than had been projected, thereby legitimizing the personal computer business. In 1988 Lowe left IBM for Xerox, then in 1991 became chief operating officer of Gulfstream Aerospace. Lowe died of a heart attack in 2013."

  "text" : "William Wilson (16 February 1834 – 16 November 1891) was a politician in colonial Victoria (Australia), a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, and later of the Victorian Legislative Council. Wilson was born at Renton, two miles from Dumbarton, Scotland. He emigrated to Australia in October 1852, in the ship Sir William Molesworth—a joint stock concern—all the passengers having an interest in her. The captain and crew went out on 1s. per month wages, in order to get their discharge on landing. Shortly after his arrival, in 1853, Mr. Wilson commenced business in the timber trade at Geelong as a member of the firm of Tate, Wilson & Wright. After they had straggled through the commercial crisis of 1854, the partnership was dissolved, whereupon Mr. Wilson went into the New Zealand trade, bringing oats, etc., to the Fiery Creek rush. He afterwards bought a business there, and on the opening of the Canton lead at Ararat, Victoria, opened a wholesale store there. Three years later he sold his business, and turned his attention, with a fair measure of success, to pastoral pursuits, first on the Lower Goulburn and then in the Lower Wimmera. He then joined the firm of Boyd, McNaught & Boyd, which was subsequently known as Wilson, Crosbie & Co. Wilson had been one of the earliest town councillors of Ararat; and in February 1866 was returned to the Legislative Assembly for the Ararat district. Wilson was Commissioner of Railways in the James McCulloch Government from 2 to 20 September 1869, and again under the same Premier from 9 April 1870, to 19 June 1871. At the following election he was defeated by Michael Carroll, but was soon afterwards returned to the Legislative Council as a representative of the Eastern Province. He afterwards retired and paid a somewhat lengthened visit to Europe. He re-entered the political arena for a short time in 1881, when he opposed the re-election of David Gaunson, at Ararat, on his appointment as Commissioner of Crown Lands, and succeeded in defeating him by a considerable majority. He did not, however, again offer himself at the general election in 1883. Mr. Wilson was in England from 1885 to 1886, when he returned to the colony. In 1873 he became a director of the National Bank of Australasia, and was chairman of the board in 1876. Mr. Wilson was largely interested in pastoral pursuits in Victoria and New South Wales, and was also chairman of the Evening Standard Newspaper Company of Melbourne. He died on 16 November 1891."

  "text" : "William Irving Winter-Irving, born William Irving Winter (1840 – 28 June 1901) was an Australian grazier, magistrate and politician, member of the Victorian Legislative Council. Winter-Irving was the third son of the late John Winter, of Lauder, Berwickshire, Scotland, who brought his family to Victoria (Australia) in 1841, and ultimately settled in Lauderdale, Ballarat, by his marriage with Janet Margaret Irving, of Bonshaw, Scotland. He was educated at the Scotch College, Melbourne, and was brought up to pastoral pursuits, in which his father achieved very great success. In 1857 he, with his brothers, purchased Colbinabbin and other stations in the Rodney district at a cost of about £200,000; and in 1868, on a friendly dissolution of partnership, the Stanhope estate fell to his share. In 1874, in conjunction with J. Ettershank, of East Loddon, Winter visited England and successfully conducted the appeal to the Privy Council against the Crown, relative to the five shilling per acre penalty sought to be enforced against the holders of certificated lands. Mr. Winter was for some years a member of the Waranga Shire Council, being twice president, and was appointed a territorial magistrate in 1868. In 1868 Winter married the only daughter of William Drayton Taylor, J.P., of Noorilim, Goulburn. In 1871 Winter stood for the Eastern Province against Sir Francis Murphy, but ultimately retired in that gentleman's favour. In 1884, on the death of Sir William Mitchell, President of the Legislative Council, he was returned unopposed for the Northern Province; Winter held this seat until death. In 1890 Winter assumed his mother's surname in addition to and in conjunction with his patronymic. His brother, James Winter, of Toolamba, Murchison, who died at Norwood, near London, in 1886, was also a well-known pastoralist."

  "text" : "Wynne Islwyn Samuel (1912–5 June 1989) was a Welsh politician. Born in Ystalyfera, Samuel became an orphan at an early age. He studied at Ystalyfera Grammar School and then a deacon and lay preacher in the Baptist Church. Although he was given an opportunity to play with Glamorgan County Cricket Club, he was dissuaded by his aunt, and instead became a clerk for Swansea Town Council. Samuel joined Plaid Cymru in the early 1930s, and became active in the party when he lost his job, following its policy of neutrality in World War II. He was the party's South Wales organiser from 1940 until 1950, also editing The Welsh Nation, its English-language magazine, and gaining election to Pontardawe Rural District Council. He established a base in Ystalyfera, recruiting sufficiently that it was home to the party's largest branch in South Wales, and he was the party's first Parliamentary candidate in the south, taking second place in the Neath by-election, 1945. Samuel stood for the party on several further occasions: Neath at the 1945 general election, Aberdare at a 1946 by-election and the 1950 and general elections, and Pembroke in 1970, but was never elected. In 1954, Samuel was the Secretary of the National Eisteddfod of Wales in Ystradgynlais, although this was not a success, due to heavy rain. In 1960/1, he was President of the Baptist Union of Wales. In later life, he studied law with the University of London External System, and then obtained a doctorate from the National University of Ireland, following which he became a barrister and law lecturer at Chester Technical College. He also set up Cymdeithas Bro a Thref Cymru, an organisation bringing together the town and community councils of Wales."

He pioneered the Gulf-McArthur-Katherine route, and was the first to strike gold at Pine Creek in 1872. Mixing cattle farming with gold prospecting, Uhr travelled Queensland and the Northern Territory before settling on the Goyder River managing a gold station there. He gained a reputation as \"a fearless and competent bushman who had little sympathy for natives\" after brushes with hostile Australian Aboriginals. In 1883 he led reprisals against an Aboriginal population for the murder of a stockman. He won damages in 1885 to the value of 3,000 Pounds sterling after a wrongful arrest for cattle theft, and from then on followed the Australian gold rush from Western Australia to Coolgardie where he founded the D'Arcy Uhr Goldmining Co. He expanded his portfolio by founding Butcher and Uhr, and settled in Coolgardie with his wife Jane Hayes. However he was widowed after the couple had two children, and he remarried Myra Essie Thompson. He died in Coolgardie and was given a lavish public funeral. His grandson, Clive Uhr, would become a noted radiologist and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire."

  "text" : "(Not to be confused with William Burges (Australian politician) or William Henry Burgess Piddington.) William Henry Burgess (21 May 1847 – 1 May 1917) was an Australian politician and businessman. Burgess was born in Hobart and was educated at the High School, Hobart, and at Horton College, Ross. He began his career as a grocer but believing the administration needed improvement he stood as a City of Hobart alderman in 1876, winning the election. He became Mayor of Hobart in 1879 and in 1881 he stood for parliament, being elected House of Assembly member for West Hobart. He became Treasurer of Tasmania from 1884 to March 1887 under Premier Adye Douglas and James Agnew.  Burgess, who was the recognised Leader of the Opposition to the Philip Fysh Ministry, was a captain unattached in the Tasmanian Defence Force. He was one of the Tasmanian delegates to the Federation Convention held at Sydney in 1891. In August 1891, owing to the stoppage of the Bank of Van Diemen's Land, with the management of which he was identified, Burgess resigned his seat in the Executive Council and in Parliament and his position as Leader of the Opposition. In 1916 Burgess made a return to Tasmanian politics, winning election to the multi-member seat of Denison as a Liberal; however, he died the following year in Hobart."

  "text" : "William Walter Murray Yeatts (died 4 August 1948) was Census Commissioner for the 1941 census of India, which was the last such exercise prior to the country's independence from the British Raj. He was appointed to the same office for the 1951 census, having elected to stay in the country, but died before it took place. Yeatts was educated in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1914, following being awarded a degree, he joined the Royal Artillery and served during World War I. He then joined the Indian Civil Service in Madras. Between 1932 and 1946 he held various positions in the Government of India, culminating in his appointments as Census Commissioner for the 1941 and 1951 censuses of that country. He had been previously been involved in the 1931 census of Madras Presidency. His oversight of the 1941 census was inauspicious, in part because of the limitations imposed by the onset of World War II and in part because of significant changes that he was persuaded to make to the methodology. A keen sportsman, although aloof, his term as president of the Himalayan Club was also affected by the war, with the club's activities being necessarily curtailed. Yeatts was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1938 and a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1946. He died in Edinburgh on 4 August 1948."
