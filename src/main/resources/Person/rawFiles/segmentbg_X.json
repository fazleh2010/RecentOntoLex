  "text" : "Xu Yong (Chinese: 徐勇; born September 1949) is a Chinese historian and professor at Peking University. He was a member of the Japan-China Joint History Research Committee established by Chinese and Japanese governments in 2006. Some of Xu's work is controversial. He has argued in research papers and symposiums that the issue of sovereignty over Okinawa is unsettled. His view is that the approval of the Qing Dynasty of China was needed when Japan abolished the Kingdom of Ryukyu and set up Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. A series of historical events are highlighted by Xu's argument, including \n*  the abolition of the kingdom by the Meiji government in 1879 \n*  US control over Okinawa after World War II \n*  Okinawa's reversion to Japanese sovereignty from US occupation in 1972. Xu's work supports China's right to claim Okinawa as part of the People's Republic of China."

  "text" : "Xochi Birch is an American computer programmer and entrepreneur in San Francisco, California. She is the co-founder of several companies since 1999, most notably the online social networking website Bebo, with her husband Michael Birch. She and Michael also founded several domains, with support from Paul Birch and Morgan Sowden. Xochi and Michael Birch launched Bebo in 2005. By 2007 the site had over 45 million registered users and was the sixth most popular site in the UK, bigger than AOL, Amazon.co.uk and bbc.co.uk. They sold Bebo to AOL in March 2008 for $850 million. Their combined 70% stake yielded a profit of $595 million from the deal. The Bebo franchise quickly declined under its new owners and fell into bankruptcy; in 2013 the couple bought Bebo back for $1 million. Following their sale of Bebo, the two started five separate companies they run in parallel. Their current project is The Battery, an exclusive members club in San Francisco, with their vision stated as “to create a culture where inspiration is embraced, diverse communities come together and egos are checked at the door.” Birch is a supporter of the non-profit organization charity:water, having given over $4 million to the organization. For her 40th birthday she asked people to donate to charity:water instead of giving her a gift; the campaign raised more than $20,000. Xochi has repeatedly spoken at the Dublin Web Summit, alongside other industry veterans such as Kevin Rose, Kevin Lynch and Robert Scoble."

Known as one of the \"Eight Great Courtesans of the Ming Dynasty\", she was an accomplished painter and poet, and was noted for her skill at mounted archery. She was particularly noted for her figure paintings, which included many Buddhist subjects. Her works are held in a number of museums both in China and elsewhere. Her archery was commented upon by a number of contemporary writers, as were her masculine, martial tendencies; these were regarded as an attractive feature by the literati of the period. She lived in Eastern China, residing for most of her life in the Zhejiang and Jiangsu districts. After a career as a celebrated courtesan in Nanjing, Xue married several times, but none of these unions lasted. During her later life, she eventually opted for the life of a Buddhist recluse."
