Zeng entered politics in 1991, when he became a Workers' Party member; thereafter he renounced his affiliation to the group and has since become a perennial candidate in Singaporean elections, albeit often dropping out of contention at the last minute. Zeng was also an active acupuncturist who arranged for global meetings and operated an acupuncture centre in Singapore, later changing his focus to selling healthcare products after a string of molestation lawsuits initiated by his patients. In 2014, Zeng was diagnosed with terminal cancer; this necessitated the excision of his entire nose, which led to significant facial disfigurement, and he became a tissue paper peddler, abandoning his previous jobs. Aspects of Zeng's life, including his court cases and unorthodox behaviour, have generated controversy and criticism."

Topel was born on April 13, 1987 in Shumen, Bulgaria to Turkish parents. Her father Cengiz Topel is a chess trainer and her mother Vildan is a nurse. She began with chess playing at the age eight when her mother presented Zehra's cousin a chess board, and her father instructed her. She moved with her father in 1997 to Istanbul, Turkey while the mother stayed in the time being in Bulgaria with Zehra's older sister Hatice. Zehra applied for Turkish citizenship, but had to wait for four years to get naturalized. In 2000, Zehra Topel was granted Turkish citizenship. In the two years from 1995 to 1997 in Bulgaria, she won many titles in her age category. However, during the time span of the first four years in Turkey, she was not permitted to represent Turkey. She spent the time before naturalization by training at home because she was not allowed to play in official national tournaments but only in unofficial ones. She won the silver medal at the 1st Mediterranean women's championship held in Lebanon in October 2003. In 2007, she was awarded the Woman International Master (WIM) title. In 2009, Zehra Topel became second in the Turkish Championship with 8/9, losing only to multiple Turkish champion WIM Betül Cemre Yıldız. She plays also simultaneous chess. Zehra Topel attended Vissh Pedagogicheski Institut v Shumen in Bulgaria studying Anglistics. She later was educated at the Istanbul Kültür University on a chess scholarship."

  "text" : "Zwelentlanga Fatman Mgcawu, commonly known as Fatman, was born and grew up in Pabalello, Upington, becoming Upington’s first black mayor in the first post-1994 local government elections. In 2013 the erstwhile Siyanda District in the Northern Cape, with Upington as its administrative centre, was renamed ZF Mgcawu District Municipality.  Mgcawu died in July 2001. Mgcawu is said to have been \"a man with many talents.\" Attending the University of Cape Town, he emerged from the Drama Department with training as an actor. \"He was a passionate actor and comedian,\" states the local government website following the Siyanda District's being renamed in his honour. \"He dedicated his life to the fight against the apartheid system,\" reports the Kathu Gazette. In addition to his acting and political roles he is also recorded as having been active in a church role. He pursued poverty alleviation projects and was instrumental in the upgrading of the Upington Airport. The process of renaming the Siyanda District in Mgcawu's honour began in 2010, being subsequently published in the Provincial Government Gazette on 22 October 2012, notice 14 of 2012; the then Siyanda District Council deciding on an implementation date of 1 July 2013."

She was the daughter of Marco Dandolo and related to the doges Andrea Dandolo and Arigo Dandolo. She married Priuli in 1526 in what was considered as almost an unequal match, as she was considered more high born than he. Zilia hosted many parties in the famous Palazzo Priuli. She was described as the leading female aristocrat and the most respected female noble in Venice, and the election of her spouse to doge is attributed to her. When her spouse was elected doge in 1556, the council decided that Zilia should be crowned. This was somewhat remarkable, as no dogaressa had been crowned since Taddea Michiel in 1478. Her Grand Entry and coronation on 18 September 1557 set the pattern for future ceremonies of the same kind. A new form of glass was named after her La Zilia. Zilia was given many honors from the state unknown to other dogaressas. As a widow in 1559, she was granted the title of princess, her own court and pension from the state: when she appeared in public as dowager dogaressa, she was accompanied by courtiers, and was entitled to wear state robes. Their marriage produced one daughter, who Titian painted in \"The Annunciation\" as Mary."

  "text" : "Zakaria Ramhani (born 1983, Tangiers) is a Moroccan visual artist who lives and works in Montreal. He is known for his large-scale paintings that use Arabic calligraphy as a formal gesture. He has caused controversy with the political nature of his art that deals with issues of Middle Eastern politics and the Arab Spring. Authorities at Art Dubai last year censored Ramhani's You Were My Only Love for its depiction of police brutality in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Ramhani altered the famous image of the \"blue bra woman,\" who became a symbol of Egyptian protest against extreme military power, showing her struggling against gorillas as Vincent Van Gogh looks on disapprovingly. Ramhani grew up in a Muslim society and in an artistic household; his father was a landscape painter who avoided portraying the human figure for religious reasons. He occasionally had to paint commissioned portraits and explained to his son that he would ask God's forgiveness. The paradox at the core of Ramhani's work is the tradition of aniconism in Islam. His fascination with portraiture is at odds with the practice of Islamic calligraphy, which has long been a venerated art form for representing the divine. In 2006, Ramhani became the youngest Moroccan citizen to be awarded a residency from the French government at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris. Since then, he has exhibited in Europe and the Middle East, including at the Barbican Centre in London, Centre d'Exposition Val-d'Or in Quebec, Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris, the Dakar Biennale, the Bahrain National Museum, the Cairo Biennale, and the British Museum at DIFC Dubai. He had one of the top ten highest auction results for artists under 30 in 2010. His work is in the collections of the Barjeel Foundation, the Alain-Dominique Perrin Collection, and the Royal family of Morocco. He is represented by Julie Meneret Contemporary Art who exhibited his work for the first time in the United States in the fall of 2013, with a show entitled May Allah Forgive Me, Vol. 1 and 2."
