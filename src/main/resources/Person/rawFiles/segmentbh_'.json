  "text" : "Muhammad ibn Ahmed ibn Muhammad 'Illish (1802 - 1882 CE) (1217 - 1299 AH) (Arabic: محمد بن أحمد عليش‎‎), more commonly referred to in Muslim works simply as 'Illish or Sheikh 'Illish, was a 19th-century CE Egyptian Muslim jurist from Tripolitanian origin. 'Illish was an important late scholar of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh). He is perhaps the last of a line of widely read and respected sources of traditional fatwas of the late Maliki school from an Azharite scholar. Sheikh 'Illish was an extremely popular teacher at Al-Azhar. His lectures were regularly attended by audiences of over 200 students. In July 1854, 'Illish was appointed the Maliki Mufti of Al-Azhar. By the time of his death in the 1880s, 'Illish was one of the premier leaders of Egyptian scholarly society. His Manh al-Jalil as well as his Fatawa are widely used today among traditional Malikis for fatwa positions of the school."
