  "text" : "Augusta Emma Wilde, Baroness Truro (née d'Este, 11 August 1801 – 21 May 1866) was the daughter of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex (sixth son of King George III), later Duke of Sussex, by his marriage with the Lady Augusta Murray, second daughter of John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, and his countess, Lady Charlotte Stewart. The prince was married at Rome, and afterwards at St George's, Hanover Square. Upon the death of his father, Sir Augustus d’Este (her ladyship's brother) claimed the dukedom; but the House of Lords decided against the claim, on the grounds of the invalidity of the prince’s marriage, it having been contracted without the consent of the Crown, as required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772 Lady Truro had strong connections with Ramsgate, residing at Mount Albion House on the East Cliff. She owned a considerable amount of valuable property in the town, mostly situated on the Mount Albion Estate. In 1845, she married Thomas Wilde, later 1st Baron Truro (7 July 1782 – 11 November 1858). They had no children. In later years, her ladyship suffered from severe bouts of asthma and had spent the autumn on the continent. She returned to her town residence in Eaton Square, London, where she died suddenly on 21 May 1866. The Thanet Advertiser remembered her as: \"a lady of strict business habits, and rather reserved in manner, of exceedingly good general information, living, while at Ramsgate, in a very quiet and unostentatious way”. The funeral took place on the afternoon of Monday 28 May 1866 at St Laurence Church, Ramsgate. She is interred in the family mausoleum (Grade II listed). She left an estate valued at around £70,000, of which over £40,000 was left to charity."

  "text" : "Alan Marshall Meckler (born 1945) is an American internet pioneer and publishing executive. He was the founder and Chairman of Mecklermedia Corporation until the company was acquired by Penton Media in November 1998, and founded several print magazines including Virtual Reality World, CDrom World, and Internet World. Until August 2014, he had been Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mediabistro Inc. whose media assets were sold to Prometheus Global Partners, leaving a company renamed MecklerMedia Corporation which is producing trade shows world-wide in such fields as 3D Printing, Bitcoin and Facebook marketing. Born in New York City in 1945, Meckler was raised in Great Neck, NY, and the son of Lilian Meckler and late Herman Meckler, a well known actor and one of the founders of modern equipment leasing whose Lease Plan International grew to 75,000 trucks in 1967 shortly after which the company was acquired by one of its largest accounts, PepsiCo, on whose board he sat. He is also the brother of the well-known director Nancy Meckler who is married to David Aukin. He received both his BA and PhD from Columbia University. His 1980 doctoral dissertation, Scholarly Micropublishing in America, 1938–1979, was published by Greenwood Press in 1982. He is also the editor of \"The Draft and its Enemies\" published in 1974 by the University of Illinois Press In 2013 Meckler began covering the field of 3D printing with the launch of the trade show Inside 3D Printing. The first version of the show took place at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in April, 2013. It has also been produced in 2013 in Chicago; San Jose, California; and Singapore. Versions are planned in 2014 in Japan, China, Australia, South Korea and Brazil. Meckler has also launched a new trade show for the virtual currency known as Bitcoin. The first show was launched in New York City in July, 2013. In May 2015, Meckler launched a show \"RoboUniverse\" in New York City and shows are planned for Seoul, Singapore, Shanghai, Mumbai and San Diego as well. In 2014, with his son John Meckler, Meckler created a mutual fund devoted to 3D printing and additive manufacturing. 3D Printing and Technology Fund is the first mutual fund worldwide devoted to this investment coverage. On July 10, 2015 the fund changed its name to 3D Printing, Robotics and Technology Fund. The fund trades under the symbol TDPNX. Meckler's daughter, Kate Meckler, is a NYC philanthropist and real estate agent. Meckler served in the U.S. Army Reserve and the N.Y. Air National Guard from 1969 to 1975."

  "text" : "Alexis Arts, aka Danilo Audiello (Born in Foggia, Italy, 5 May 1986), is an Italian illusionist, escapologist, actor, dancer, and creative director in the theatre world. His shows mix artistic illusionism with mentalism and other disciplines such as dance, transformation (quick-change), mime, theatre, Chinese shadow artistry, and martial arts. As such he could be defined not only as a magician, but as an all round entertainer trained in numerous fields. His passion is to combine these skills in order to create different atmospheres and characters that tell moving, unexpected stories—stories which make audiences question their perceptions of reality. As such Arts refers to himself as a \"fantasist\"—dedicated to building surreal spectacles and stories that both move and perplex the viewer. One of his most notable achievements to date, is that he has broken 6 Guinness World Records. These are for the fastest escape from a pair of handcuffs, fastest escape from a straitjacket, the Largest Card Illusion Reveal. and the Largest Mentalist Mnemonics Book Test. Alexis won the award of the European Championship of Magic, FISM 2014 in the category of Big Stage Illusions with his Prison Break act. His latest achievement was the World Championship of Magic FISM 2015, in which the Prison Break act was awarded as the best in the category of Big Stage Illusions bringing the title to Italy again after 40 years."

  "text" : "Abraham Cressy Morrison (1888–1951) was an American chemist and president of the New York Academy of Sciences. Abraham Cressy Morrison was born in Wrentham, Mass. on December 6, 1864. He traveled extensively with his parents (California, Isthmus of Panama) before they were “met with reverses” and he had to “give up all educational advantages and devote himself to the serious problem of life” at age 13. “He drifted from retail dry goods to machinery and tools, from wholesale dry goods to work in a hotel, from a lawyer’s office to syrups and molasses, from coals and wood to hard rubber and from there to a proprietary [business] called Maltine.” “The proprietary business with the Maltine Manufacturing Company was not satisfactory in some respects, but during the short time he remained in their employ he was called upon to interview, on the subject of their wares, some seven thousand physicians and five thousand druggists.” This provided him with a foundation into the technique of advertising and landed him a job with the Pabst Brewing Co., where he eventually became in charge of advertising/publicity, at the age of 23. He worked for Pabst Brewery from 1895-97. It appears that Morrison was hired by Pabst principally to market Pabst's 'Malt Tonic' which was sold as the 'Best Tonic.' Morrison was an avid ‘wheelman’ (bicyclist). He was an official in the League of American Wheelmen, serving as president of the Milwaukee Wheelmen, and eventually being named vice president in the national organization. He participated in long distance races and finished “within the money” in several 100-mile contests. He worked in Milwaukee and had a cottage in the Village of Whitefish Bay. The Milwaukee to Whitefish Bay ‘run’ was described by bicycling enthusiasts of the day as perhaps the most popular short run in Wisconsin. An early magazine for bicycle enthusiasts stated, “The road is always in prime condition and during the summer months good entertainment may be found at the Bay. The famous road begins in the extreme northeastern part of the city and follows a winding course of 5 miles along the lake shore.” Morrison led local and national campaigns to improve roads and was appointed by the governor of Wisconsin to the ‘Committee on Good Roads.’ While in Milwaukee, Morrison had many other interests. He wrote a history of Milwaukee for a publication by the local real estate companies, and a chapter on the brewing industry that was itself included in the History of Milwaukee County. He also wrote some literary works – including \"The Story of Damon and Pythias,\" and \"The Man Who Resembled Christ.\" The first publication was adopted as the “authentic version of the Knights of Pythias and ran through several editions – nearly 200,000 copies.” Morrison published a book \"Man in a Chemical World\" in 1937, joining a growing tradition of books that tried to make science better known to the public. Cressy Morrison is well known for his beautifully poetic little book, \"Man Does Not Stand Alone,\" a condensed version of which was published by Readers Digest Books under that title. It was published in 1944, during the depths of the Second World War. In the publisher's preface to the condensed version, it is described as \"a believing scientist's challenge to Julian Huxley's famous work \"Man Stands Alone\". The work is described in that preface as \"One of the best sellers of the twentieth century.\" He also made a notable brief position statement entitled, \"Seven Reasons a Scientist Believes in God.\" While serving as president of the New York Academy of Sciences, Morrison offered the \"Morrison Astronomy Prize\" from 1926 until at least 1945. One of the recipients was Hans Bethe for his theory of the carbon cycle in stars (1939). It is reported that Bethe, who on becoming aware of the prize, asked Physical Review to delay publication of his paper so he could compete for the Morrison Astronomy Prize. Bethe famously told the tale that he used the $500 prize to \"liberate my mother's furniture\" from Germany. In 1967, Bethe received the Nobel Prize for the carbon cycle. Some published articles refer to Morrison as 'Dr.' A. Cressy Morrison, or as ‘Professor.’ While he was a named a ‘Fellow’ in the New York Academy of Sciences – a position generally held by esteemed scientists, his education appears to have been limited to “a public school education and a year in business college.\" Cressy, as his intimate friends knew him, married the former Marguerite Snow of New York. They had a family summer residence on Deer Isle, located just southwest of Bar Harbor, Maine, where Morrison spent time entertaining and fishing."

  "text" : "Stern was born in Suwałki, Poland (then part of the Russian Empire). During the First World War his mother fled the Germans with him and his brother David. They found refuge with her sister in Russia. When he was separated from his mother the 13-year-old Avraham earned his keep by carrying river water in Siberia. Eventually he stayed with an uncle in St. Petersburg before walking home to Poland. At the age of 18, Stern emigrated on his own to Palestine. Stern studied at the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem. He specialized in Classical languages and literature (Greek and Latin). His first political involvement was to found a student organization called “Hulda,” whose regulations stated it was dedicated “solely to the revival of the Hebrew nation in a new state.” During the 1929 riots in Palestine, Jewish communities came under attack by local Arabs, and Stern served with the Haganah, doing guard duty on a synagogue rooftop in Jerusalem’s Old City. Stern’s commander and friend Avraham Tehomi quit the Haganah because it was under the authority of the local labor movement and union. Hoping to create an independent army, and also to take a more active and less defensive military position, Tehomi founded the Irgun Zvai Leumi (\"National Military Organization\" known for short as the \"Organization\"). Stern joined the Irgun and completed an officer’s course in 1932. During his life Stern wrote dozens of poems embodying a physical, almost sensual, love for the Jewish homeland and a similar attitude towards martyrdom on its behalf. One analyst referred to the poems as expressing the eroticism of death together with de-eroticism of women. Stern’s poetry was heavily influenced by Russian and Polish poetry, especially Vladimir Mayakovsky’s. His song Unknown Soldiers was adopted first by the Irgun and later by the Lehi as an underground anthem. In it Stern sang of Jews who would not be drafted by other countries while they wandered in Exile from their own country, but rather who would enlist in a volunteer army of their own, go underground and die fighting in the streets, only to be buried secretly at night. One of the commanders of Lehi, Israel Eldad, claimed this song (along with two others, written by Uri Zvi Greenberg and Vladimir Jabotinsky) actually led to the creation of the underground. In other poems from the same period, up to eight years before he founded the Lehi underground, Stern detailed the feelings of revolutionaries hiding in basements or sitting in prison and wrote of dying in a hail of bullets. One example of his poetry is: “You are betrothed to me, my homeland \\ According to all the laws of Moses and Israel… \\ And with my death I will bury my head in your lap \\ And you will live forever in my blood.” Stern became one of the university’s top students. He was awarded a stipend to study for a doctorate in Florence, Italy. Avraham Tehomi made a special trip to Florence to recall him, in order to make him his deputy in the Irgun. Stern spent the rest of the 1930s traveling back and forth to Eastern Europe to organize revolutionary cells in Poland and promote immigration of Jews to Palestine in defiance of British restrictions (this was therefore known as “illegal immigration”). Stern developed a plan to train 40,000 young Jews to sail for Palestine and take over the country from the British colonial authorities. He succeeded in enlisting the Polish government in this effort. The Poles began training Irgun members and arms were set aside, but then Germany invaded Poland and began the Second World War. This ended the training, and immigration routes were cut off. Stern was in Palestine at the time and was arrested the same night the war began. He was incarcerated together with the entire High Command of the Irgun in the Jerusalem Central Prison and Sarafand Detention Camp."

  "text" : "Aiden Dillard is an American independent film director and artist. He is known for using surreal humor and camp (style) within the confines of low-budget film. Aiden Dillard was born in Escondido, California, but grew up in Durham, North Carolina. Aiden Dillard's feature films and video art often deals with contrasts between a rural and urban area, and high culture and low culture. While studying at Cooper Union in New York City on a full-tuition scholarship, his student film \"The Battle of the Burps and Farts\" was screened at TromaDance 2004 and was the only film in the history of the festival that was booed by everybody in attendance. Upon graduation Aiden Dillard directed an outrageous psychedelic spoof of \"Reefer Madness\", titled \"Meat Weed Madness\", which featured set decoration by Joe Holtzman, the editor-in-chief of Nest (magazine), and crudely constructed props and stop-motion animation. \"Meat Weed Madness\" premièred at the Wolfsonian-FIU in December 2005 during Art Basel Miami Beach, and was released on DVD by Troma Entertainment in 2006. Aiden Dillard's even more outrageous sequel \"Meat Weed America\" was released by Troma Entertainment on DVD in the fall of 2007, and features Troma's president Lloyd Kaufman, Debbie Rochon, and Peter Stickles. In 2008, Aiden Dillard moved to Miami, and wrote, produced, and directed a psychedelic crime-drama about children with autism who see angels called \"Special Angelz\", which premiered at Borscht Film Festival. In 2009, Aiden Dillard wrote, produced, and directed an action-comedy spoof of \"Death Wish (film)\" called \"Death Print\", which was set in the Miami art-world and shows an art dealer, played by Ted Vernon, who battles a Cuban Communist terrorist, with the help of musician Otto Von Schirach. This movie had a sold out premiere at the Colony Theater on Lincoln Road in South Beach. From 2010-2012 Aiden Dillard performed in an art noise band, called Ballscarf, that incorporated video projections and Aiden Dillard's own nudity to produce an effect that was described as \"nightmarish chaos\". In 2013, Aiden Dillard moved back to North Carolina and began to focus on visual art. In 2014 Troma Entertainment released Aiden Dillard's campy yet bloody slasher film \"Bikini Swamp Girl Massacre\" on DVD."

  "text" : "Antoine Robidoux (1794–1860) was a fur trapper and trader in the American Southwest, and son of Joseph Robidoux III and his wife Catherine Marie Rollet. His family were of French-Canadian descent and were strongly connected to the history of the North American fur trade. One of his five brothers, Joseph Robidoux IV, established the Blacksnake Hills Trading Post that eventually developed as the town of St. Joseph, Missouri. Antoine visited Utah on 13 November 1831 or 1837. Antoine was born in St. Louis and spoke English, French, and Spanish. In his early years he helped his father extend his business westward, taking up residence in Santa Fe, gaining Mexican citizenship, and after marrying the Governor's daughter Carmel Benevides, he received near-exclusive license to trade and trap in the Ute country of what is now western Colorado and eastern Utah. In 1828 he built Fort Uncompahgre, the first permanent trading settlement west of the Rockies in the Spanish intermountain corridor between Santa Fe and the Uinta Basin. Just a few years later he purchased the Reed Trading Post. Fort Uncompahgre was destroyed by Indians in 1844 and the fur business declined with changes in the European market. Over the next decade Antoine worked as guide and US army interpreter. In 1846 he was wounded in battle and applied for a government pension. Antoine married Carmel Benavides (1812-1888) in 1828. Carmel was the daughter of a Spanish officer was killed fighting the Comanches. They adopted a girl Carmelete, who married Isador Barada. Barada and his brother Edmund were arrested in 1849 for illegally operating a gaming house and fined $50 each. Their subsequent appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court resulted in a reversal of their conviction. He died in 1860 in St. Louis."

  "text" : "Asad ibn Abdallah ibn Asad al-Qasri (died 738) was a prominent official of the Umayyad Caliphate, serving twice as governor of Khurasan under the Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik. The descendant of a prominent Arab family, he was the brother of Khalid al-Qasri, the powerful governor of Iraq for most of Hisham's reign. Asad's first tenure as governor in 724–727 came in the wake of the \"Day of Thirst\", a severe defeat at the hands of the Turgesh Turks in Transoxiana. Asad tried to reconcile the local Soghdians to Muslim rule, initiated tax reforms to address the grievances of the native converts to Islam (mawali), and enjoyed good relations with many local nobles, who began to convert to Islam under his influence. His military expeditions during his first tenure were targeted mainly against restive local princes, avoiding a direct confrontation with the Turgesh. After his dismissal, his successors reversed his policy of reconciliation, resulting in a large-scale anti-Arab rebellion among the Soghdians. Another major defeat against the Turgesh in the Battle of the Defile was followed by the almost complete collapse of the Arab position in Trasoxiana and the outbreak of a major rebellion in Khurasan itself, led by al-Harith ibn Surayj. Appointed for a second time to govern Khurasan in late 734, Asad brought fresh troops into the province and managed to suppress Harith's uprising in 735–736, although the rebel leader himself escaped capture. An expedition in Khuttal in 737 brought about the intervention of the Turgesh khagan at the head of an army. Despite initial Arab setbacks and the Turgesh invasion of Khurasan, Asad succeeded in inflicting a defeat upon the khagan in person at the Battle of Kharistan, turning back the Turgesh army. Despite Asad's death a few months later, this success was instrumental in preserving Muslim rule in Central Asia, as the blow to the khagan's prestige led to his murder soon after and the collapse of Turgesh power. At the same time, Asad's conciliatory policy towards the native population laid the foundations for its eventual acceptance of Muslim rule and the Islamization of Central Asia."

From 1928 to 1935 he was in New Zealand making films about the Māori people. In 1928 he was sent by Carle Laemmle of Universal Studios to make a film he called Taranga, but did not keep to schedule or make any effective footage. So the film was made as Under the Southern Cross by Lew Collins. Two years later and described as \"somewhat eccentric\" Markey then returned for the making of Hei Tiki; originally a silent film, which was released in 1935 with music and voice-over added in America. The film was shot in Waihi. When shooting was finished Markey left for America with “the film footage, many of the artifacts he had borrowed from Māori, a great many unpaid bills, and his partner Zoe Varney”. He had obtained £10,000 from New Zealand inverstors, and borrowed taonga or cherished tribal artifacts from the Māori cast. He had fired Alfred Hill who was to write the music, and Ted Coubray the original cameraman, but sold Coubray’s camera to his rivals the Welsh brothers. A 1935 New York Times review of Hei Tiki says that Merkey had been a lecturer and editor."

In 1936, he left the ILP and joined Plaid Cymru, and as a result was victimised and dismissed from his job, surveying roads in Flintshire; he eventually received compensation for the dismissal. Despite not being a prominent figure in Plaid, he was elected President in 1943. He was also selected as the party's prospective candidate for Merioneth. However, he was unable to fulfil either responsibility, as he suffered with what was described as a \"nervous condition\", and the leadership of the party was in practice covered by his Vice President, Gwynfor Evans. Evans replaced Williams as the candidate for Merioneth in the 1945 general election, and replaced him as party President later in the year. Williams died early in 1963."

Prior to EpiVax, she was a professor at Brown University, where she established the TB/HIV Research Lab. The laboratory attracted a range of intelligent and creative Brown University undergraduate and graduate students (Bill Jesdale, Gabriel Meister, Tamar Renaud, Jessica Stevens, and many others) who worked with De Groot on projects ranging from improving healthcare for inmates living in correctional facilities in the United States, improving access to care in West Africa, and developing cutting edge tools for analyzing protein sequences and designing vaccines. While at Brown University, De Groot worked with Gabriel Meister and Bill Jesdale to develop the EpiMer and EpiMatrix epitope mapping tools. These were among the first motif-based and matrix-based, fully automated T cell epitope mapping tools. The team applied these tools to HIV vaccine design, and were soon travelling to HIV Vaccine conferences as a group to demonstrate how the tools could be used to help design vaccines that would be effective against a range of HIV strains (see GAIA Vaccine, and GAIA Vaccine Foundation). Additional tools were developed that automated genome sequence analysis for highly conserved, immungenic epitopes, starting from any protein sequence. Having successfully collaborated with a range of institutions, including University of Pennsylvania, Hopkins University, Harvard University, and the CDC, De Groot, working with then-consultant Bill Martin, decided to establish a commercial company to make these tools available to a wider audience. EpiVax was founded with an initial grant from the Slater Biotechnology Foundation (in 1998). During the 1998-2008 period, EpiVax became a well known for innovative, collaborative research in computational vaccinology and immunoinformatics. De Groot was invited to establish a new Institute at the University of Rhode Island in 2008. She currently directs the Institute for Immunology and Informatics at the University of Rhode Island, the GAIA Vaccine Foundation and the . She currently teaches a vaccine course at the University of Rhode Island downtown campus, and her laboratory does research on 'immune camouflage'."

  "text" : "Alfred Catt (19 December 1833 – 28 October 1919) was a South Australian politician. He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1881 to 1902, representing the electorates of Stanley (1881-1884) and Gladstone (1884-1902). He was Commissioner for Public Works under John Cox Bray from 1881 to 1884 and again under Thomas Playford II from 1887 to 1889. Catt was born in Newington, Kent, England, third child of Charles Catt, a carpenter, and his wife Sarah, née Knott.Catt arrived in South Australia in 1847, and for ten years engaged in agricultural pursuits at Balhannah and Strathalbyn. After a short trial of the Victorian diggings he returned to Strathalbyn, and entered into business. Subsequently he opened a store at the then youthful town of Gladstone, South Australia. Catt was elected to the Assembly for the district of Stanley, 27 April 1881. Three years later, when the constituency was reconstructed, he was returned for Gladstone. Catt accepted the post of Commissioner of Crown Lands in John Bray's first administration, on 24 June 1881, and held it till 23 April 1884, under circumstances of special difficulty. Disasters had fallen thickly upon the farmers of the colony, especially in the northern districts lying beyond Goyder's Line of rainfall, where thirsty and often heavily timbered country had been taken up at extravagant prices by the competing agriculturists, who in some cases had offered as much as £6 6s. per acre. The attempt to grow wheat in these parts proved that the selectors could not pay the stipulated price, and the Government of the day came to the rescue with a proposal that the farmers should be allowed to surrender their land and compete for it again. The result was that they got their land back at about £1 0s. 6d., thus entailing upon the State a nominal loss of about half a million. The surrender clauses were admittedly difficult to administer, and Mr. Catt was much blamed at the time for allowing farmers holding excellent land in the lower north and south-east to come under these clauses. Catt, however, claimed that these were exceptional cases. On the fall of the John Downer Ministry in 1887, Catt accepted the portfolio of Commissioner of Public Works under Thomas Playford II, and held it from 11 June 1887, to 27 June 1889. At the commencement of the session of 1890 Catt was unanimously elected to the Chairmanship of Committees of the Legislative Assembly. In 1887 he received the royal permission to bear the title of \"Honourable\" within the colony. Catt died in St Peters, Adelaide, South Australia, on 28 October 1919."

Sood held various positions at Mayo Clinic (research fellow, Consultant, Instructor of Medicine) and fellow of the American College of Physicians. Best known among his works are Attention and Interpretation Therapy (AIT) and Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART) which integrates elements from neurosciences, psychology, philosophy and spirituality to offer a scientific approach for stress management. As per Sood, studies show that people who are more optimistic tend to have better physical health, lower risks of strokes and heart disease, and higher overall survival rates. They also have better emotional health, lower stress, lower percentages of depression, better relationships, and are better equipped to solve life's problems. Sood claims that human mind wanders for half to two-thirds of the day and we can measure happiness through validated happiness scales, assessment is subjective Sood states that the classic fight-or-flight reaction is mostly due to the three major stress hormones, adrenaline, cortisol and norepinephrine"

  "text" : "Alfred Smith (9 July 1812 – 14 January 1892) was an English cricketer notable for his fourteen first-class cricket appearances for Sussex as a gentleman cricketer between 1841 and 1852. Smith was born in Henfield, Sussex. He played for West Sussex and the Gentlemen of Sussex first in 1839. He played several matches for each against East Sussex, the Players of Sussex, and various Gentlemen teams of Surrey and Hampshire throughout 1839 and 1840. He was invited to first play for Sussex on 14 June 1841 against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. On his debut he was dismissed for scores of four and one, batting in the lower order. Smith would face the MCC once more that year, in August at Brighton, before waiting a whole year for his next first-class match. He played, again for Sussex, on 29 August 1842 against an England XI where he was dismissed by William Hillyer for ten. Smith's activities for the next two years are unrecorded, and he does not feature on a cricket scorecard until June 1844, where he played three matches against East sussex and the Gentlemen of Hampshire. He joined Henfield Cricket Club and featured for them against Brighton that year also. In May 1845 he played for Petworth Cricket Club against the MCC, followed by Hampshire and then the MCC once more - all first-class games. He played a Gentlemen v Players game in September 1845, an early County cricket matches in 1851 between Sussex and Kent, and faced the All England XI in 1852 followed by two more outings against Kent. He then played a dozen more games against various Gentlemen's XIs including his final match in 1866. He died in 1892 in Wantley."

  "text" : "Alec David Edward Muffett (born April 22, 1968) is an internet-security evangelist, architect, and software engineer. He is principally known for his work on Crack, the original Unix password cracker, and for the CrackLib password-integrity testing library; he is also active in the Open Source software community. Alec Muffett was born in Pennsylvania, the third child, and only son, of David Joseph Mead Muffett and Kathleen Jubb; his sisters are Louise and Amanda. Alec was educated at Sacred Heart College, Droitwich and University College London, where he studied Astronomy. After graduation he commenced work as a lab assistant and Unix administrator at the university. In 1988 he took a position as Systems Programmer at the University of Wales in Aberystwyth, and it was there that he wrote the first version of the dictionary attack tool Crack. He was active on the Zardoz list during this period. Muffett joined Sun Microsystems in 1992, working initially as a systems administrator. He rose “through the ranks” to become the Principal Engineer for Security, a position which he held until he was retrenched, with many others, in 2009 (shortly before Oracle acquired Sun). While at Sun he was one of the researchers who worked on the factorization of the 512 bit RSA Challenge Number; RSA-155 was successfully factorized in August 1999. Muffett also worked on the Sun MD5 hash algorithm, which was introduced in Solaris 9 update 2. The new algorithm drew on Muffett's work in pluggable crypt, and it is now implemented in many different languages, for example Python. The algorithm uses the complete text of the famous soliloquy from Shakespeare's Hamlet: \"To be or not to be, that is the question...\" as the constant data. Muffett justified the choice of this text because \"it exposes more programmers to Shakespeare, which has got to be a good thing\".After a sabbatical year, Muffett began to work on The Mine! Project, as lead developer. He subsequently became a director and consultant at Green Lane Security; he also consults for Surevine. He became a director of the Open Rights Group in October 2011.Muffett blogs professionally, for Computer World at Unscrewing Security and personally at Dropsafe, and has numerous publications to his credit, besides being an frequent presenter at technical conferences.Muffett is the a co-inventor (with Darren Moffat and Casper Dik) of the patent \"Method and apparatus for implementing a pluggable password obscuring mechanism\", United States Patent 7,249,260, Issued June 12, 2003.Alec Muffett's father, David, was a larger than life character: a former British Colonial Administrator in Africa, big game hunter and professor of African studies at Duquesne University at Pittsburgh. Alec has inherited many of his father’s characteristics, and an appreciation of his approach to life, and security, can be gained by watching his famous “Defence in depth: castle assault” video . Muffett lives in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, United Kingdom and his interests include cooking, photography and bicycles. He worked as a Software Engineer for Facebook."

She told reporters that as member of a committee on justice, formed as part of Meghalaya Legal Service Authority, she was trying to help the parents of a rape victim access a media centre. She was involved in exposing graft and lack of transparency in child nutrition programs. She advocated for programs supporting local food rather than use of contractors. Fellow activist Angela Rangad said Kharshiing's 2013 arrests were attempts \"to suppress any attempt of asking questions and bringing to light largescale illegal deals and land grabs.\" Kharshiing has not been deterred from activism by detention. She said:“I will continue to fight with them for their rights and will not retreat even if I have to face arrest a thousand times”"

  "text" : "Andrew \"Cap\" Tilles (Nov. 25, 1865 - Nov. 22, 1951) was an American business magnate and philanthropist. At an early age, Tilles adopted his childhood nickname of Cap, which he used for the rest of his life. Tilles revolutionized the United States horse racing industry. Later in life, Tilles dedicated his resources to philanthropic projects in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1896, he co-founded and actively ran an investment syndicate that dominated the US horse racing industry through World War I. The investment syndicate became known in the media as the \"Big Three,\" after its three principal partners: Louis A. Cella, Samuel W. Adler, and C. A. Tilles. The syndicate was officially known as C.A.T., which was short for the Cella, Adler, and Tilles partnership. In 1905, Tilles was forced to close his race tracks, as a result of progressive politics abolishing gambling in Missouri. The closing of the tracks eventually resulted in a multimillion-dollar personal fortune for Tilles with the sale of the partnership's land holdings in St. Louis. The Delmar Race track land was particularly lucrative property for sale and development along the famed Loop of Delmar Boulevard. Tilles used his fortune to expand C.A.T. across the country. By 1914, Tilles had acquired 25 horse racing tracks across the United States, the most of any investor in US history. In 1901, he founded the Western Turf Association, which eventually monopolized the Midwestern and Southern track systems. By World War One, the Big Three had acquired most every major non-coastal horse race track in the heart of the country, with the exceptions of Hawthorne Race Course in Chicago and Churchill Downs. As president, Tilles revolutionized the horse racing industry by introducing electricity to the game, developing the modern system of licensing book makers, and holding the first ever recorded instance of night racing. Tilles was also associated with the cigar, real estate, stock, and brokerage businesses. In 1901, C.A.T. took ownership of the Delmar Investment Company, which among its holdings included a bucket shop. In 1909, bucket shops were declared illegal by the Anti-Bucket Shop Act of Congress. In 1910, Tilles and his partners at the Delmar Investment Company were arrested in the Western Union bucket shop scandal. Federal agents raided Western Union and uncovered a secret and illegal telegraph and ticker service for bucket shops across the country. In 1911, Tilles was extradited to Washington D.C. to stand trial for illegally operating and conspiring to operate a bucket shop in St. Louis. On October 10, 1911, the case was dismissed in favor of Tilles' acquittal after the Anti-Bucket Shop Act was declared unconstitutional by Justice Wright of the district of Columbia Supreme Court. In later years, Tilles turned towards philanthropy. Among his other charitable acts, Tilles initiated a million dollar foundation for the education of poor children. He also funded and developed three municipal parks, which remain in use to this day: Rosalie Tilles Memorial Park, Louis Tilles Memorial Park, and Tilles City Park."

  "text" : "Albert C. Triaca  (1875 – ?) was an Italian balloonist, pioneer aviator, and businessman. Triaca grew up in Italy as the son of a wealthy Naval Officer. He started as a student of the École polytechnique de l'université Paris-Sud where he created an aircraft that was submitted to the war department for development. Triaca flew a balloon in France to qualify as a French pilot for competition, but had the balloon escape after landing from a two-hour flight. He traveled to America in 1908 to become director to the New York School of Automotive Engineers. Triaca was an early Balloonist, marketing Stevens balloons in America. He provided a gold medal for the Aero Club of America balloon competition of 1909. The same year his French wife formed a woman's balloon club and participated in balloon events with her husband. On 1 May 1908, Triaca provided a balloon to the New York Air National Guard providing the first flights of the oldest National Guard unit in the United States. Albert C. Triaca founded the International School of Aeronautics in Paris, France and New York in 1908. Triaca demonstrated models and slide shows of the latest aeronautic developments in America and France. Facilities included a hydrogen generator for balloons and dirigibles, and sleds to wind test propellers. Triaca moved the school to Garden City, New York, near the Hempsted Plains Aerodrome. He developed an early experimental water cooled biplane in 1909 tested at Morris Park, Bronx intended to fly at the 1910 Gorden Bennett race. He also competed that year in the Aero Club of America competition, earning the tenth balloon license issued by the organization. Triaca partnered with Sidney B. Bowman Automobile company to market the Bayard dirigible, Antoinette motor, Stevens balloon, Curtiss motors and Chauvire aeroplane. He also listed himself as an aeronautical engineer to the New York based Church Airplane company in 1910. Triaca eventually separated from the Aero Club of America because he felt it was losing its interest in sport aviation. He closed the International School of Aeronautics in late 1910 to seek his fortunes in Massachusetts as president of the Aeroplane Company of America with the intention of license building Farman aircraft. When asked about the alarming death rate of early aviators, Triaca said that \"the science is right, the art is right, it is the individual who is at fault\"."

  "text" : "Adrienne Adele Augarde (12 May 1882 – 17 March 1913) was a British actress and singer popular for nearly a decade on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, primarily for her roles in Edwardian musical comedy. She began her career in 1898 in pantomime and small roles in musical comedy and opera, before gaining wide popularity playing leading roles in the popular musicals produced by George Edwardes. She also appeared in a few dramas. After starring in a number of long-running productions in London and New York from 1903 to 1912, Augarde embarked on an American vaudeville tour. During the tour, she fell ill and died, after a failed appendectomy, at the age of 30."

He joined the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, where he attained the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. He played cricket at various levels until his late forties, mostly as a batsman, including nine first-class matches for Sussex in 1908 and eight for MCC from 1908 to 1911. His highest first-class score was 42, for MCC against Leicestershire in 1909. He played Minor Counties cricket for Berkshire in 1926 and 1927, scoring 101 out of a team total of 194 against Hertfordshire in 1927. He served as secretary of Berkshire CCC and assistant secretary of Surrey CCC. At The Oval in the late 1920s he organized the net sessions for young club members; Ronald Mason remembers him as \"tall and willowy with a shock of grey hair on a handsome head that swayed engagingly as he walked\". Luther was also a prominent rackets player. He married Mary Noel in July 1921. They had one son."

After being arrested for arson against the farmer's property, he was confined from 1833 to 1839 to the New York House of Refuge, a juvenile detention facility in Manhattan, from which he escaped several times. Indentured to a farmer in Rockland County, New York, in 1839, he soon returned to Rochester, where he was convicted of larceny the following year. He went on to serve several terms in the Auburn State Prison and the Clinton State Prison. Released in 1866, he received a pardon from New York's governor, Samuel J. Tilden, in 1876. Reed lived until at least 1895, according to a manuscript letter preserved in New York State records. Reed's memoir, written around 1858-59, when he was still incarcerated, was acquired by the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale and authenticated by Yale scholar Caleb Smith, who published an edition of the manuscript in early 2016."

  "text" : "Alan D. Berg (born February 18, 1932) is an American international development authority, most notable for his advocacy and large-scale implementation of strategies to address malnutrition, especially among children and pregnant women. Berg's professional focus on nutrition spans more than half a century and has earned him wide recognition for stimulating a new policy approach to international nutrition assistance. His work has helped to transform the way development agencies and national governments think about the problem of malnutrition as a fundamental component of economic growth. His innovative planning and multisectoral operational work, particularly during his long tenure as the senior nutrition officer at the World Bank (1972–95), have modeled a number of practices that other donor institutions and countries now often incorporate into their own projects. Furthermore, Berg’s efforts to transform development assistance for nutrition have prompted a number of academic training programs for nutritionists to expand their curriculum to include coursework in nutrition policy, planning, and implementation, creating a new career path for graduates. In a 1997 survey of the international nutrition community, Berg was the one most often cited as a role model for young persons entering the field. In 2008, the United Nations Standing Committee on Nutrition honored Berg as one of the first recipients of the United Nations Achievement Award for Lifelong Service to Nutrition, citing him at the presentation as \"a global giant in nutrition history."

  "text" : "Allen Wade Kerr (born November 19, 1956) is an insurance agency owner in his native Little Rock, Arkansas, who was from 2009 to 2015 a Republican member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from District 32, which includes part of Pulaski County. In his third term in office, Kerr was term-limited in the election of 2014 and succeeded by his fellow Republican Jim Sorvillo. Governor Asa Hutchinson in 2015 appointed Kerr as the Arkansas Insurance Commissioner. First elected without opposition to the state House in 2008 to succeed fellow Republican Sid Rosenbaum, Kerr serves on the joint committees of Legislative Auditing and Public Retirement & Social Security Programs, of which he is the chairman. He is a member too of the State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Revenue and Taxation Committee. Kerr has a conservative voting record in the state House. He voted to override the vetoes of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation requiring photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas and to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation or whenever fetal heartbeat is felt. He voted to prohibit abortion from being included on the state health insurance exchange. He supported allowing the sale per month of up to five hundred gallons of unpasteurized whole milk directly to consumers from the farm. Kerr voted against approved legislation to make the office of county prosecutor in Arkansas nonpartisan. He co-sponsored legislation to allow handguns on church properties and to empower university officials to carry weapons in the name of campus safety. Kerr graduated from Jacksonville High School in Jacksonville in Pulaski County and attended the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. He is an award-winning agent with Farmers Insurance. He is a former member of the Pulaski County Quorum Court, akin to the county commission in most other states. He and his wife, the former Marliese Lea Estes (born 1965), are members of the United Methodist Church. The couple has two sons and two daughters. In the Republican primary held on May 20, 2014, Jim Sorvillo defeated intraparty rival Pat Hays, 54-46 percent, for the party's nomination to succeed Kerr."

  "text" : "Alan Arthur Reid (born 29 January 1956) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon and Geelong in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He also played for East Fremantle in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL). Reid, who came from Coorow, was a member of East Fremantle's 1974 premiership team. Reid began his professional career at 17 years old. He represented Western Australia in an interstate fixture against Victoria at Subiaco Oval in 1977, which they won by 94 points, to record their first ever \"State of Origin\" victory. A wingman, Reid had a strong debut season at Essendon in 1979, when he averaged over 20 disposals from his 16 appearances and polled nine Brownlow Medal votes. Only Terry Daniher polled more votes for Essendon that year. Injury restricted him to seven games in 1980, but he was a regular again in 1981, playing 18 games. His only appearances in 1982 came late in the season, due to an ankle injury. In 1983 he played only in round two, then got a clearance to Geelong, where he played seven games. He finished his VFL career on 52 games. Despite Essendon making the finals in three seasons that Reid played, 1979, 1981 and 1982, he never got to participate in a finals series. He moved to China in 1985 and has lived there since. A University of Western Australia graduate, Reid worked at the Australian Embassy in Beijing as Minister Commercial and Senior Trade Commissioner then at Fosters China Limited as Chief Operating Officer, during the 1990s. He is currently the Managing Director of Intercedent (Beijing) Ltd."

  "text" : "Adelaide Anne Procter (30 October 1825 – 2 February 1864) was an English poet and philanthropist. She worked prominently on behalf of unemployed women and the homeless, and was actively involved with feminist groups and journals. Procter never married. She became unhealthy, possibly due to her charity work, and died of tuberculosis at the age of 38. Procter's literary career began when she was a teenager; her poems were primarily published in Charles Dickens's periodicals Household Words and All the Year Round and later published in book form. Her charity work and her conversion to Roman Catholicism appear to have strongly influenced her poetry, which deals most commonly with such subjects as homelessness, poverty, and fallen women. Procter was the favourite poet of Queen Victoria. Her poetry went through numerous editions in the 19th century; Coventry Patmore called her the most popular poet of the day, after Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Her poems were set to music and made into hymns, and were published in the United States and Germany as well as in England. Nonetheless, by the early 20th century her reputation had diminished, and few modern critics have given her work attention. Those who have, however, argue that Procter's work is significant, in part for what it reveals about how Victorian women expressed otherwise repressed feelings."

In 1827 Fraser went to London and five years later sailed for Sydney, New South Wales, in the Rubicon. The ship, however, put in at Hobart, Tasmania (then called Van Diemen's Land), and he decided to stay there, which he did till 1852, when he visited Victoria and decided to settle there. Fraser had been interested in pastoral properties in the colony as far back as 1836, and he now started as an auctioneer in Bendigo, removing the business to Melbourne in 1853. In October 1858 Fraser was elected to the Legislative Council for the North Western Province, and was Commissioner of Public Works in the Francis Ministry from 14 June 1872 to 4 May 1874, representing the Government in the Council (Upper House). He was principally known as the plaintiff in an action which he brought against The Age (Melbourne) in 1878 for damages for a libel contained in an article reflecting on his conduct towards a deceased brother who had died in England in indigent circumstances. He recovered £250. Fraser died in St Kilda, Victoria, Australia on 20 August 1888."

  "text" : "Argrim (French: Argrin, Latin: Argrimus) was one of the rival bishops of Langres following the disputed election of 888. He was the uncontested bishop after 899 until his retirement in 910. Before becoming bishop he was a monk of Saint-Bénigne de Dijon. The death of bishop Geilo of Langres on 28 June 888 after the death of the Emperor Charles III in January resulted in the election of the bishop's successor taking place amidst political upheaval. Argrim was elected by the people in accordance with canon law, and was consecrated by archbishop Aurelian of Lyon. Despite the legality of the entire procedure, archbishop Fulk of Reims, a partisan of Carolingian legitimist claimant Charles III, opposed it and tried to install a rival bishop, Theutbald II. Although Pope Stephen V sided with Fulk, Aurelian refused to consecrate Theutbald and Argrim remained in power at Langres. During this time, Argrim had the support of King Odo of France, who issued a diploma to him on 19 December 889. After two years and three months, in the autumn of 890, Argrim was forced to flee Langres and Theutbald was installed as bishop. According to the Annales Vedastini, in late 894 Theutbald was assassinated and Argrim returned to power. Pope Formosus immediately anathematised the assassins, but granted the pallium to Argrim. In 896, Pope Stephen VI, who had been an enemy of Formosus, declared Argrim deposed. Argrim went to Rome to protest, and in 899 John IX revoked the deposition. His successor, Benedict IV, confirmed the revocation. In 910 Argrim resigned and returned to Saint-Bénigne de Dijon. His tombstone is preserved in the museum of Chalon-sur-Saône. It reads: + IN HOC SEPVLCRO QVIESCIT ARGRIMVS MONVQVONDAM EP'S LINGONIQVI OBIIT VII KL' FB'R"

He is currently wanted by the FBI for conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, providing and attempting to provide material support to terrorists in connection with Al-Qaeda, conspiracy to kill in a foreign country, conspiracy, and false statements. As of 2014, he was believed to be living in Syria with his wife and at least one child, according to authorities who are offering a USD 50,000 reward for tips leading to his arrest.

  "text" : "Antoine (\"Tony\") Wright, born 4 March 1960, is a ni-Vanuatu politician. Having studied in Morocco and at the International School in Bordeaux in France, he worked at the French embassy in Vanuatu. He was first elected to Parliament in the October 2012 general election, as MP for Port Vila, representing the Union of Moderate Parties - a francophone, generally conservative political movement. When Prime Minister Sato Kilman lost the confidence of Parliament on 23 October 2013, new Prime Minister Moana Carcasses Kalosil (of the Green Confederation) appointed Wright as Minister for Youth and Sports within his broad coalition government. In February 2014, he was one of several government MPs to defect to the Opposition, but then defected back to the government a few days later to retain his Cabinet position. He lost office when the Carcasses government was brought down by a motion of no confidence on 15 May 2014. In June 2015, following a further change of government which returned Sato Kilman to power, Wright became a government backbencher. In October 2015, together with several other MPs, Wright was convicted of bribery by the Vanuatu Supreme Court. The court found that he had accepted a payment of 1,000,000 vatu from Moana Carcasses in return for support in the motion of no-confidence that brought the Kilman government to power."

  "text" : "Abraham Carel Wertheim, also known as A.C. Wertheim (Amsterdam, 12 December 1832 – Amsterdam, 30 November 1897) was a banker, politician, and philanthropist from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Born into a family of emancipated and enlightened Dutch Jews, he developed his banking and investment skills at Wertheim & Gompertz, an investment firm founded by his uncle Johannes Wertheim. He was subsequently apprentice at prominent banker Julius Königswärter, who introduced him into cultural salons in Amsterdam. Upon his marriage to his cousin Rosalie Marie Wertheim he became a partner in Wertheim & Gompertz. This bank, together with a number of other firms, played a significant role in financing the building of new railroads in the United States. He was a patron of amateur drama in Amsterdam, and stimulated the development of the (later Royal) Dutch National Theatre Company (Vereeniging Het Nederlandsch Tooneel), soon the only major theatre company in the city. It played at the Municipal Theatre and the Grand Théatre. Wertheim was intimately involved in the rebuilding of the Municipal Theatre on the Leidseplein square after it burnt down in 1890. He was a mason. He was involved in a large number of Jewish communal organisations in Amsterdam, including being the president of the Jewish community. While he was not observant himself, he did not advocate reform and considered Orthodoxy the only representative movement within Judaism. As a liberal politician he was a member of the States-Provincial for North Holland (1866-1886) and from 1886 until his death of the Senate. He was a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. He is commemorated in the Wertheimpark in Amsterdam East, which contains a monument dedicated to him. He had eight children, of whom three died in childhood. His brother-in-law was Barend Joseph Stokvis. His nephew was pedagogist Philip Kohnstamm, and his grandchildren were composer Rosy Wertheim and sculptor Jobs Wertheim."

  "text" : "Aaron Goldsmith (born August 29, 1983 in Wichita, Kansas) is an American sportscaster. Since 2013, he has been a play-by-play announcer for the Seattle Mariners Radio Network, working innings 3, 6 and 7 of each game. In addition, Goldsmith also does some of the lead play-by-play on selected games for Root Sports Northwest during the Mariners baseball season. Goldsmith also does selected baseball games, primarily on selected Saturdays for Fox Sports 1. In the off-season, he also provides play-by-play for college football on Sports USA Radio Network and Pac-12 basketball on Fox Sports 1. Goldsmith spent the early part of his childhood in Wichita, Kansas and he was a Royals fan. He attended his first game at Kauffman Stadium and he has stated that Bo Jackson, George Brett, and Bret Saberhagen were some of his favorite players as a child. When his family moved to St. Louis, Goldsmith became a Cardinals fan. Goldsmith has stated that legendary Cardinals announcer Jack Buck was a big influence to him and that he meant just as much to St. Louis, as legendary Mariners announcer Dave Niehaus meant to Seattle. When Goldsmith was attending Principia College in Illinois working on a degree in history, he said that he woke up one morning, thinking that sportscasting may be a fun career. After graduating from Principia with his history degree, Goldsmith began taking classes at the Broadcast Center in St. Louis. Due to his history background, Goldsmith often found he was four years behind other students. It took 10 months for Goldsmith to graduate from The Broadcast Center. Upon graduation, Goldsmith began play-by-play broadcasting as an intern for Gateway Grizzlies games. The year was 2007, and Goldsmith would provide 2-innings of play-by-play for each home game. Goldsmith would follow this up with an unpaid internship with the Bourne Braves and then a similar position with the Portland Sea Dogs. In all cases, Goldsmith would be allowed to call select games or innings. During these stints, Goldsmith often found himself starving after calling games and realized he didn't even have a dollar to his name. After a brief time with the Sea Dogs, Goldsmith worked as the play-by-play voice for the Frisco RoughRiders. He would also serve as the team's manager of broadcasting and public relations. Goldsmith would remain with the RoughRiders for two seasons. During his time with the RoughRiders, Goldsmith proposed to his wife, Heather, and she accepted. In 2012, Goldsmith was hired to be the play-by-play voice for the Pawsox Radio Network. Goldsmith would provide play-by-play for every game that season, a first for himself. Goldsmith admits he joined the PawSox because of their history to produce big name announcers, but he knew that was no guarantee. Finally in 2013, Goldsmith joined the Mariners announcing team alongside Rick Rizzs. Goldsmith and his family now live in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. Goldsmith's play-by-play style is often attributed to an adaptation of Vin Scully, but Goldsmith attributes his style to his work with Eric Nadel and Dave O'Brien."

  "text" : "Armin Kohl Lobeck (1886-1958) was a noted American Cartographer, Geomorphologist and Landscape Artist. He was born in New York City on August 16, 1886, but his family moved to Haworth, New Jersey, three years later. Armin Lobeck was 21 years old when he entered Columbia University in 1907 because he dropped out of high school to care for his family when his father became ill. In his senior year at Columbia, he took Master's level courses in botany and architecture, and received his AB degree in 1911 and his Master's Degree in 1913. After working as a teacher at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy from 1911-1914, he returned to Columbia University where he was awarded his Ph.D. in 1917. At the beginning of World War I, he enlisted in the US Army and was sent to Fort Dix, NJ, but he was soon transferred to the United States Department of State. He was assigned to The Inquiry, an organization under Colonel E. M. House to prepare for making peace at the end of the war. While there, he received a reasonable salary of $183.00 a month. At the war's end, he was assigned to the Geography Section of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace. His duty was to prepare physiographic maps of problem areas, such as the Balkans, the Istria, Albania, and other regions. Armin Lobeck accepted a position as associate professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and worked there for 10 years from 1919-1929. His first physiographic map of importance was published as the large scale \"Physiographic Diagram of the United States\", published by the Nystrom Company in 1921. In 1929 he returned to Columbia University as full Professor of Geology, where he remained until his retirement in 1954. During World War II, Dr. Lobeck was employed by the Military Intelligence Service (United States), G-2, on the General Staff of the United States Army, and the Army Map Service. There he prepared sketch maps for the invasion of North Africa. He also prepared a series of European maps in sections for the use of the staff, that were combined after the war into a large physiographic map of Europe. Armin Lobeck died in Englewood, New Jersey, at the age of 71 years on April 26, 1958."

In September 1858 Kyte offered a sum of £1000 towards the expenses of an exploring expedition to cross the Australian continent from south to north. This led to the despatch of the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition in August 1860. In August 1861 Kyte stood for East Melbourne as a candidate for the Victorian Legislative Assembly, and defeated Edward Langton, who in February 1866 defeated him in a contest for the same constituency. Kyte represented Richmond from January 1867 to December 1867. Kyte died in Carlton, Victoria on 16 November 1868, survived by his wife, a son and two daughters."

He raised a considerable sum of money and joined the rebels in their capital of Ramla, where he was initially warmly received and acclaimed as \"Commander of the Faithful\". Soon, however, the money he had brought with him ran out and the Jarrahids ceased to respect him, while they were willing to receive gifts and money from the Fatimid Caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. Disheartened, Hasan returned to Mecca and Fatimid allegiance, while the Jarrahid rebellion was crushed by the Fatimid troops in late summer 1013."

  "text" : "Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn ibn Ali al-Maghribi (Aleppo, May 981 – Mayyafariqin, 1027), also called al-wazir al-Maghribi (\"the Western Vizier\") and by the surname al-Kamil Dhu'l-Wizaratayn (\"Perfect Possessor of the Two Vizierates\"), was the last member of the Banu'l-Maghribi, a family of statesmen who served in several Muslim courts of the Middle East in the 10th and early 11th centuries. Abu'l-Qasim himself was born in Hamdanid Aleppo before fleeing with his father to Fatimid Egypt, where he entered the bureaucracy. After his father's execution, he fled to Palestine, where he raised the local Bedouin leader Mufarrij ibn Daghfal to rebellion against the Fatimids (1011–13). As the rebellion began to falter, he fled to Iraq, where he entered the service of the Buyid emirs of Baghdad. Soon after he moved to the Jazira, where he entered the service of the Uqaylids of Mosul and finally the Marwanids of Mayyafariqin. He was also a poet and author of a number of treatises, including a \"mirror for princes\"."

The son of the governor of Bust, Maymandi was raised as the foster brother of the Ghaznavid prince Mahmud, and would first start his administrative career as the head of the department of correspondence of Khorasan. He would thereafter rapidly rise to higher offices, finally becoming the vizier of the Ghaznavid dynasty in 1013, which would last until 1024, when he was arrested due to the great amount of wealth that he had gained, which the suspicious Mahmud disliked. However, after a brief civil war, which ended in 1030, Maymandi was freed by Mahmud's son Mas'ud I, who offered him the chance of becoming vizier again. He first rejected the offer, but alter accepted in 1031. Maymandi's second vizeriate would only last one year, when he died at Herat. He was succeeded by Ahmad Shirazi."

  "text" : "Alois Machek (known in Serbian as Alojz Mahek/Алојз Махек) was a Czech football player and coach, and was responsible for the popularization of football in Serbia and Yugoslavia during the first two decades of the 20th century. Machek was born in Hradec Králové and started playing football in the local club. Then he became a metallurgic employee at the Škoda factory in Plzeň and played for a club named Češký lev. He received a message from his friend and compatriot, Eduard Mifek, who was already playing football in Serbia; Mifek invited him to become a player of a newly founded club, SK Velika Srbija. Machek met an envoy from the club, Serbian footballer Josip Furjanović, in Vienna, who presented him the proposal, and Machek accepted. He arrived in Belgrade, Kingdom of Serbia, in 1913 at the age of 18. Machek was among the first group of players that formed SK Velika Srbija. The first team was formed by young players Vlada Krstić, Mika Mitić, Mileta Jovanović, Jovan Ružić and Milorad Ilić, plus older and experienced Josip Furjanović, Milivoje Ivanović and Eduard Mifek. The club president Danilo Stojanović, who was also the goalkeeper, also recruited FK Šumadija 1903 players Petar Radojković, Mikan Pavlović, Dragoljub Veljković, Milorad Jovanović, Milanče Stefanović, as well as Venčel Petrovický from Bohemia. Besides Machek, Mifek and Perovický were also Czechs. Machek immediately impressed the others with his excellent technique, dribbling and strong shot and, besides being a player, he was also pointed out as team coach. He gained major popularity, and is considered by sports journalist Srbislav Todorović as the sole individual responsible for laying the foundation for modern football in Serbia. He was responsible for introducing the Czech school of football in Serbia, a school which was the most advanced at that time, alongside the Austrian and Hungarian models. In 1914, in addition to being a coach/player of Velika Srbija, he took charge as coach of another Belgrade club, SK Srpski mač,  which became the unofficial champions of Serbia that year. That same year, he played with Velika Srbija for the Serbian Olympic Cup. The final was played between Velika Srbija and Šumadija, and Velika Srbija won 3-1, with Mahek scoring two of the three goals of his team. All Serbian clubs ceased their activities with the start of the First World War on 15 July 1914, and most players were conscripted to the Serbian Army. Most of the elder players who were not conscripted, along with the foreign ones, left Belgrade and moved south to the interior of Serbia. Machek, along with his compatriots Mifek and Petrovický, were taken by Velika Srbija president Danilo Stojanović to play in Kragujevac with Šumadija, which was another club that Stojadinović had founded earlier. Machek and Petrovický later played at FK Morava Ćuprija, which had just been founded by other players from Belgrade that took refurge there during the war. At the end of the war in 1918, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was formed, renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929. The clubs were restored, and Ajojz Mahek rejoined Velika Srbija, now renamed to SK Jugoslavija. He would play with SK Jugoslavija until 1926. Along with his compatriot Karel Blaha as SK Jugoslavija coach, he went on to be part of the Yugoslav First League championship winning squads in 1924 and 1925; the two national championships crowned his playing career. He moved to SK Soko Beograd in 1927,  and lived in Yugoslavia for the rest of his life."

A daughter of minister (and one-term member of U.S. Congress) Mark Trafton, Trafton was born in Saccarappa, Maine around 1842 (sources vary, it was likely closer to 1842 though many say February 8, 1845). She studied for a time at Wesleyan Female College in Wilmington, Delaware. She began publishing short pieces in the Springfield Republican newspaper in 1868 under a pseudonym. In 1872, a series of her foreign letters published in that paper were released in book form as An American Girl Abroad. Two novels were serialized in Scribner's Monthly before being published in book form, including Katherine Earle (1874) and His Inheritance (1878). In 1889 she married lawyer Samuel Knox, Jr. (d. 1897). Her 1890 work Dorothy's Experience first appeared in serial form in the Christian Union. She was opposed to women's suffrage. A 1980 volume on American women writers opined that Trafton is little remembered now, and likely did not have much impact on other writers of her time. Yet, although \"her plots, by modern standards, seem contrived and sentimental ... she wrote lively, interesting stories\" and \"remained popular with young readers for at least a few decades.\""

In July 1995, she was accused of stealing a T-shirt from a clothing store. Asaki was never actually convicted of shoplifting, but Soka Gakkai claims that she was guilty, explaining, \"In recent years, shoplifting by housewives has become a social issue.\" She offered a restaurant receipt as an alibi, but police discovered that it was forged. Several newsweeklies reported that the clothing store proprietor was a member of Soka Gakkai who could have invented the shoplifting charge, and were all sued for defamation. Two months later, Akiyo fell to her death from a sixth-story apartment building next to Higashi-Murayama Station. Police ruled the death a suicide. She was 51."

  "text" : "Aeta Adelaide Lamb (1886-1928) was one of the longest serving organizers in the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the leading militant organization campaigning for Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom.She was born in Demerara in British Guiana, and named after a palm that her father, the botanist William Davis Lamb, had discovered there. Her father died when she was a child, and Aeta, her 2 siblings and her mother Adelaide, daughter of General Henry Nicoll, CB returned to live in England. She attended Notting Hill High School between 1898-1899.She joined the WSPU in 1906 - she was noted to be very eloquent and she wrote some of Christabel Pankhurst's speeches while working in its information department, even being said to be the 'real brains' behind some of her best known rhetoric. In October 1906 she took part in a deputation to the House of Commons and was arrested, but ultimately released after her mother paid her fine. Despite this she took part in another deputation in February / March 1907, and another in October 1908, resulting in prison terms of a week, then a month, served in Holloway Prison.In July 1907 she assisted with by-election campaign in North West Staffordshire alongside Annie Kenney and August 1907 in Bury St Edmunds alongside Emmeline Pankhurst, following which she was appointed as a national WSPU organizer in October 1907 whilst working with Miss Kenney in Bristol. In January 1908 she was again assisting Emmeline Pankhurst, this time at the Mid-Devon by-election, and then at the Herefordshire (Ross) by election. From there she was one of the main organizers the first meeting of the Bath branch of the WSPU in April 1908. It was here also that she got to know the Blathwayt Family of Eagle House, Batheaston which they operated as a home of refuge for suffragettes between 1908 and 1912. In 1911 Lamb was one of the last WSPU members to go there, planting a commemorative tree in their arboretum which they had named the 'Suffragette's Rest', before the Blathwayts withdrew their support due to the militancy of the organization.In April 1908 she helped Mary Gawthorpe in the Kincardineshire by-election campaign, after which she went on to help in the Montrose Burghs, Dundee and Stirling Burghs by election campaigns in May, and then another in Pudsey in June 1908. After these campaigns, her health and stamina began to fail, so she returned to London to work at the WSPU headquarters at Clements Inn until the outbreak of the Great War, becoming one of its longest serving organizers. One of her last duties was to draw up a list of suffragette prisoners for use in the campaign - by the time of its completion it contained over 1,200 documents relevant to the arrest of over 450 suffragettes. She remained loyal to the WSPU throughout its campaign, despite developing increasing misgivings of its policies of violent protest over the course of her time with them. During the War she worked in War Depots, and afterwards was largely unsuccessful in finding gainful employment, despite learning shorthand, typing, and even cookery. She died of cancer at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital at the age of 41 years."

  "text" : "Abby Kasonik is an American Painter born in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1975. She attended Stuart Hall School in Staunton, Virginia and completed her studies at VCU School of the Arts with a degree in Sculpture. “Charlottesville artist Abby Kasonik has quickly established a reputation around the country for her sublimely meditative paintings.” Her work tends towards enigmatic shadowy figures on a low horizon line, isolated and indistinct, as if seen through a dense fog, or heavy mist. Thin washes of color produce a veil of thick and thin drips, giving solidarity to the atmospheric space. Her paintings are “From the abstract to distinct, each painting utilizes... contemplative colors to create dreamlike vignettes.” Over time, and with atmospheric changes in light, paintings reveal subtle shifts in color and tone. A result of the many layers of underpainting, overpainting and glazes, this is the work's unique quality of depth. Depth is a key element in the pieces, as Kasonik plays with pictorial depth in the visual field of each painting. Her paintings offer the familiar landscape, but present it as confounding and quixotic, such that the viewer may never clearly define the narrative. Abby’s “terrains are devoid of life. Man made objects may be present, a railroad track or fence posts, but nothing animate moves; nothing grows.” Her body of work “emphasizes the infinity of space and engenders a sense of contemplative peace.”…\" So exaggerated that it keeps the paintings from being mere derivative iterations of traditional landscape.” Kasonik's paintings are inspired by water and science her “over-sized paintings feature layers of acrylic paint on canvas in evocative shades of blues and grays.” “Drawn to aquariums, Abby's work is heavily influenced by water and dimension. From the abstract to distinct, each painting utilizes calming contemplative colors to create dreamlike vignettes. Her process, which entails various and repetitive coats of acrylic paint and water, is incredibly laborious.” Kasonik continues to create and show her art throughout the country."

  "text" : "Aurora Cornu (born 6 December 1931, Proviţa de Jos, Prahova County, Romania) is a Romanian-born French writer, actress, film director, and translator. An independent spirit, she ran away three times from home, the last time permanently at the age of 14. She was adopted by an uncle. Her father died in prison after he was arrested for harboring a fugitive general of the defunct Romanian Royal Army (who was another of her uncles) for 11 years. She graduated from the \"Mihai Eminescu\" Literary School in Bucharest, and worked for a while for the poetry section of \"Viața Românească\" while doing translations. Her first husband was Marin Preda, to whom she was married between 1955 and 1959 (or 1960), and whom she encouraged to publish Moromeții, whose manuscript she had found in a drawer. Her fiancé in the mid-1960s, mathematician Tudor Ganea, did not succeed in getting her out of Romania, so she saw her chance to defect to the West while she was at the poetry festival in Knokke-Het Zoute, Belgium. She settled down in Paris, France, where, being destitute, Pierre Emmanuel's wife paid her rent for several years. In Paris she befriended, among others, Romanian émigrés Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, and Jean Parvulesco. Between 1967 and 1978 she was a collaborator of Monica Lovinescu and Virgil Ierunca in their literary radio program aired by Radio Free Europe. While living in France, she married Aurel Cornea, a Romanian-born French television sound engineer, who was a hostage of the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group known as the \"Revolutionary Justice Organization\" for ten and a half months in Lebanon in 1986. She has paid the construction costs for a church in Cornu, a church whose design was inspired by a Horia Damian drawing. In later years, she has been living in Paris and in New York."

  "text" : "Alexander Thomas Glenny (18 September 1882 – 5 October 1965), was a British immunologist known particularly for his work on the prevention of diphtheria. He was born in Camberwell, London, England, educated at Alleyn's School, Dulwich and awarded a B.Sc. by the University of London in 1905. In 1899 he started working for the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories, then in Central London, becoming head of the immunology department in 1906. He worked on immunizations and antitoxins against diseases, including tetanus and diphtheria, and, later, chemical weapons. His scientific work focused on the mechanisms of antibody production and the prevention of diphtheria. In 1921 he and H. J. Südmersen discovered the primary and secondary immune response. In the same paper they also briefly described the properties of diphtheria toxoid, which had been discovered by Glenny in 1904, apparently by accident. In 1925-6 he developed alum-precipitated diphtheria toxoid. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1944 and awarded the Edward Jenner Medal by the Royal Society of Medicine in 1953. Glenny died in 1965. He had married Emma Blanche Lillian Gibbs (born 1886) on 7 July 1910. They had three children, John (1913), Peter (1915), and Barbara (1918)."

She is featured in CNNIBN.com as top 30 witty, intelligent and incredibly funny Indian women to follow on Twitter. Aditi has written columns and articles in Grazia Men magazine, DNA and Firstpost.com and Financial Times (UK, Weekend Edition). Mittal is one of the better-known faces of the Indian English stand-up comedy scene in India. In 2009, she was one of the first 5 Indians to be featured in an Indians only stand-up show called Local Heroes, organized by the U.K based “The Comedy Store.”  Today, she is a regular at Canvas Laugh Factory, Comedy Store Mumbai and has performed at venues and humor festivals across the country, clubs in UK and at Laugh Factory, Los Angeles. In 2013, Mittal was invited by the BBC for the prestigious 100 Women conference in London.Mittal first performed her solo show ‘Things they wouldn’t let me say’ in July 2013 at the Canvas Laugh Factory, Mumbai. She is currently on tour with this show, which features an appearance by sex therapist, Dr.Mrs. Lutchuke and Dolly Khurana, the “thinking” Bollywood starlet. Mittal has been featured in the American documentary Stand-Up Planet, along with American and South African comics, which is a stand-up comic’s quest to find some of the best humor coming from corners of the developing world.

Her jokes cover everything from Osama to sanitary napkins, toddlers to Miss India winners. She says, “My brand of humour is personal. It’s observational.”  She developed the character of Dr. (Mrs.) Lutchuke because she did not like the way sex was portrayed by the media. Mittal has spoken at India’s 1st Sex Exposition by India Today, WIFT India (Women in Film and Television), Indian School of business, Hyderabad and comedy festivals across the country. She can speak fluent English and Hindi and has comprehension in French and Spanish. She believes that humour is the best fix for gravitas. Exuding an easy charm, Aditi Mittal, a fan of Tina Fey and Kirsten Wiig, stepped into the stand-up comedy scene after quitting her job in New York and moving to India. Allured by the burgeoning interest in it, she trained herself, subsequently moving on to live performances. In December 2014 she featured as a part of the Roast panel on the AIB (All India Bakchod) Knockout. In February, Mittal appeared as a guest on BBC Radio 4's The Now Show."

He came to U.S. 1887 and arrived in Alaska 1896 when he struck lucky. From 1897 he lived in Dawson City with dancer and opera singer Violet Raymond (he bought her all of diamonds in Dawson worth $75.000, gave her $20.000 in gold dust and $1000 a month in spending money), they married in 1901 in San Francisco, then settled in Seattle. His wedding gift to her was supposedly box full of gold worth approximately $100.000 and honeymoon in Orient, visiting Japan and China before making a trip to Paris. Violet estimated they carried a half million dollars out of the mines. From 1900 they were the owners of the Seattle's Holyoke Building and from 1905 to 1906 also the owners of the newly build 250 rooms Stander's Hotel (razed in 1930).Less than a year and a half after the opening of the Hotel Anton and Violet divorced, they divided an estate worth approximately $900,000. Stander had a problem with alcohol. Some says that Stander died in Pioneers' Home at Sitka, Alaska, some that he died in Multnomah, Oregon, because he was evicted from Pionere's Home for drunkenness."

In 1838, he was assistant treasurer of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad, which, along with three other railroads, built the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore. His service as an early railroad executive is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument. In 1841, he purchased Printz Island, toward the eastern end of Little Tinicum Island in the Delaware River. He was a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. In 1867, Smith published \"On the colonies of plants observed near Philadelphia\", the first of several scientific papers about the plants — often introduced from foreign lands — found on ballast heaps in the ports, and wharves of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. On April 5, 1869, he was appointed U.S. District Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In 1876, he published a revised edition of \"The Campaign Against Quebec,\" a history of the Revolutionary War campaign of 1775 by his grandfather, John Joseph Henry.

  "text" : "Agnes de Selincourt (1872–1917) was a Christian missionary in India, responsible for the founding of missions, becoming the first Principal of Lady Muir Memorial College, Allahabad, India and then Principal of Westfield College, London, UK from 1913 until her death in 1917. She was born on 4 September 1872 in Streatham, London, the eldest sister of Ernest de Sélincourt, who became vice-principal of the University of Birmingham. Her father, Charles Alexandre De Sélincourt, was a merchant of French origin, and her mother was, Theodora Bruce, née Bendall. She was educated at Notting Hill High School and attended Girton College, Cambridge from 1891 until 1894, where she obtained a first class degree studying French and German. From 1895-1896, she studied Oriental languages at Somerville College, Oxford. She reputedly had a working knowledge of 14 languages. She then spent a time also teaching at Sheffield High School. Women's education with a Christian mission was central to her life. Whilst still at university, in 1893, de Selincourt and her friend Clara Ruth Rouse were instrumental in bringing several independent organizations in British women's colleges into affiliation with the British College Christian Union. They also detailed how to transfer the ideals of social settlement work, involving serving a community by living among its people, from their college life into missions. In 1894 they outlined a plan for a Missionary Settlement for University Women where women from English universities would set up a hostel in India and do medical, educational, and evangelistic work. In 1896, she helped found this Missionary Settlement for University Women in Bombay, India, setting into practice the strategy of befriending the Indian women so that the teachings were heard. In 1900 she accompanied Mary Fraser on a walking tour of the Kula Valley. In 1901, she became the first Principal of Lady Muir Memorial College, Allahabad, India, and remained there until 1909. In 1904 she wrote describing the early days of her work at Lady Muir College telling how teaching was given in Hindustani, the one common language amongst students from 'widely different races and antecedents'. She was 'intensely interested to watch the development of these girls' whose commitment to intellectual pursuits were an 'encouragement for the future' and the students' 'fellow-countrywomen'. On her return to England she worked for the student Christian movement. In 1911 she was part of the executive committee chairing the second mission conference on Islam, in Lucknow, where she called on female missionaries to reach out to upper-class Muslim women, rather than taking the easy option of contact with the poorer classes, and in 1912 continued writing articles on her thoughts on missionary work, publishing an article in the newly formed International Review of Mission journal. In 1913, de Selincourt succeeded Constance Maynard as Principal of Westfield College, the second person to hold the lead role (and the first to use the title principal). There she continued working to support women's Christian higher education. She promoted the college with more vigour than her predecessor, and introduced public lectures, inviting the local and academic community to attend - the high point was the annual commemoration day, which included a speech from the Vice Chancellor of the University of London, and a Guest of Honour, one of the first of whom was Dame Millicent Fawcett, a leading non-militant women's suffrage campaigner. Her time in office as the principal was overshadowed by the Great War, and the financial hardship that this ensued. In 1917, her life, and term as Principal of Westfield, were cut short as she died from a tetanus injection following a cycling accident near the College. She died on 31 August 1917 at the Whitby Nursing Home, leaving her effects to her brother. Number 13, Kidderpore Avenue, London, originally known as Kingswear, was purchased in 1917 by Westfield College, and renamed Selincourt Hall following her death, and the Agnes de Selincourt Scholarship in Mathematics for Westfield College was named in her honour. The Agnes de Selincourt fund, a branch of the Trust Association of The Student Christian Movement of Great Britain was also named after her. A memorial plaque to Agnes de Selincourt is located in the Chapel at Girton College, Cambridge."

He was educated at Rugby and Trinity College, Oxford; and ordained after a period of study at Ripon College Cuddesdon in 1864. His only post was as Curate at St Alban's, Holborn, 1862-1913. Stanton was an indefatigable champion of the poor, staunch champion of ritual and exuberant preacher. He attracted devoted supporters and horrified critics in equal measure. In 1877 he founded a society for postmen, the Saint Martin's League. At the end of his life he was offered, and rejected, a prebendal stall in St Paul's Cathedral. Following his death, his funeral took place on 1 April 1913. Fellow clergy escorted his coffin as it was carried on a wheeled bier through crowded streets from his Holborn church to the London Necropolis railway station, Waterloo for transport to Brookwood Cemetery near Woking where a crowd of 1,000 had assembled for his interment."

He studied at Institut fur Osterreichische Geschichtsforschung and was a Professor at the University of Vienna, 1898-1936. Dopsch, using archaeological evidence, rejected the highly defined periodization of other scholars in favour of an emphasis on long term continuity and gradual change. He argued that the collapse of the Roman Empire in Western Europe was not as catastrophic as had previously been thought and that the Middle Ages had evolved in an orderly way as the Germans absorbed and developed Roman culture. Some of his views have since been rejected by modern scholars but his work continues to represent an important perspective on the debate about the effects of the collapse of the empire on Western Europe."

  "text" : "Antonello Bonci (born in Pesaro, Italy) is a neurologist and a neuropsychopharmacologist. In 1985, he went to Medical School at the Catholic University of Rome, where he graduated in 1991. In that same year, he started a Residency in Neurology at the University of Rome Tor Vergata that he finished in 1995. When he left the University of California in San Francisco in 2010, Dr. Bonci was Professor in Residence in the Department of Neurology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the Howard J. Weinberg Endowed Chair in Addiction Research.He is internationally renowned for the elegance and multidisciplinary breadth of his studies on the long-term effects of drug exposure on the brain. Dr. Bonci’s laboratory was the first to demonstrate that drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, modify the strength of the connections between neurons. This finding cast a new light on the phenomenon of drug addiction, which could now be seen as a process of maladaptive learning. In 2010, he was appointed as the Scientific Director of National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA). He is now also adjunct professor of Neuroscience and Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He has published more than 150 articles in many of the most prestigious scientific journals, such as Cell, Nature, Science, Neuron, Nature Neuroscience, PNAS, just to name a few."

  "text" : "Antemas was born in Amuntai, South Kalimantan, on 20 October 1923. He completed a junior high school education. In the 1950s Antemas was the head of Mastraco, an import and export company, which entered the film industry in 1957. The company owned the Cathay Jakarta cinema and a film company, Pan Asiatic Film. Over the next thirteen years he took a variety of roles, including chairman of the All-Indonesia Cinema Owners' Association (Gabungan Pengusaha Bioskop Seluruh Indonesia, or GPBSI), as well as secretary general of both the Indonesian Film Import and Distribution Union (Persatuan Impor dan Distribusi Film Indonesia, or PIDFI) and the National Film Council (Badan Musyawarah Film Nasional). During the 1960s Antemas, together with Naziruddin Naib and other film brokers who disapproved of the Communist Party of Indonesia's influence in the film industry, broke away from PIDFI (since renamed PIDFIN) and established the Association of Indonesian Film Importers, Producers, and Distributors (Gabungan Importir, Produser, dan Distributor Film Indonesia, or GIP-RODFIN). The author Eddie Karsito describes this as Antemas \"bravely and openly challenging the Communist Party\". Following the coup attempt on 30 September 1965, PIDFIN was banned, while GIP-RODFIN survived. On 21 December 1970, while attending a meeting of the GPBSI in Jakarta, Antemas had a heart attack. He was declared dead in the meeting room. Beginning in 1974, GPBSI awarded the Antemas Award during the Indonesian Film Festival. This award was granted to the film which had sold the most tickets in the preceding year. The award lasted until 1992. The last winner award was Garin Nugroho's Cinta dalam Sepotong Roti."

  "text" : "Alexander C. Stuart (1831–1898) was a British-born American painter, specializing in naval scenes. He grew up in Glasgow, served in the British Army, and immigrated to US around 1861. Since then lived and worked on the East Coast of the United States. In the US he served in the Marines and the Navy (Union) until 1866; since then he worked as an artist and illustrator. In the U.S., Stuart worked primarily on navy bases and shipyards near the Delaware River. He also worked quite a bit in Washington, Philadelphia, and New York. According to an account of his life written by Stuart, he had studied engineering and medicine before enlisting in the English Army in the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. After resigning from the Navy, Stuart began working as an artist and illustrator for the merchant shipbuilding companies. His first employer was John Roach & Son in Chester, for whom he worked from 1872 to 1880. He later worked for Harlan & Hollingsworth in Wilmington, Delaware. During this period Stuart produced numerous illustrations of early iron steamships built by these firms. These images became valuable documentary sources for this era of shipbuilding in the U.S., giving Stuart's work added value. In 1882, Stuart went to New York, seeking to earn a name and living as an artist in the city. This move did not prove successful. A year later, he moved to Florida. There, he first settled in St. Augustine and then moved to Eustis where he worked as a physician for nearly a year. In 1886, Stuart moved again to the Wilmington area and stayed there until 1895. From there he moved with his daughter to Camden, New Jersey. His financial condition in the final years of his life saw a decline, but he painted marine subjects until his death in 1898."

  "text" : "Aristeidis Metallinos (Greek: Αριστείδης Μεταλληνός; (1908 – 19 May 1987) was a Greek sculptor. There is no official record of Metallinos' birth date; he was one of three sons of Zacharias and Eleni Metallinos. Except for one carving in stone of a woman's shoe when he was 20, Metallinos spent the greatest part of his life working as a shoemaker, stonemason, builder and general craftsman in the village of Ano Korakiana on the island of Corfu in Greece. Despite early evidence of his imaginative talent as a carver of stone, Metallinos was prevented by poverty from artistic training. He did not begin his work as a self-taught sculptor until 1973, when at the age of 67 until his death in 1987, he fulfilled a long held intention of using hammer and chisel 'to bear witness to human nature and its weaknesses' «να παρουσιάσω τον άνθρωπο και τα ελαττώματά του». The Scops owl Metallinos carved on a stone plaque fixed to the front of his house, displaying his initials, and holding a builder's trowel and a sculptor's hammer, is dated the year he made the transition from builder to sculptor, depicting in stone and marble a unique record of a fast changing pastoral economy, emphasising the primacy of the family, village institutions and traditional customs, yet mingling with this account of Greek folklore, works that are erotic, ribald and subversively political. His work of over 250 pieces, nearly all completed in the last 12 years of his life, is kept together in a family museum in Ano Korakiana - a museum he built himself, intending it as a gift to the village. Metallinos' first wife, Eleni, died childless. He was married again, late in life, to Angeliki, who bore him two children, Andreas and Maria. He died at the age of 79 on 19 May 1987. Andreas and his wife Anna continue to live in Ano Korakiana in the museum that houses a unique collection of work largely unknown outside the village in which it was created. \n* ΕΟΚ (Ευρωπαϊκή Οικονομική Κοινότητα) 1980.

He has written articles on topics including the Greek poets Anacreon and Theognis, as well as book reviews for Classical World. His poems and translations have appeared in such journals as Persephone, the Southern Humanities Review, and Literary Imagination. He has taught at Harvard, Columbia, Pomona College, and NYU.

  "text" : "Anita Palmero (September 16, 1902 - January 11, 1987) was a Spanish cabaret and tango singer, as well as an actress. Nicknamed the \"Cancionista nacional\", she had a successful career in Argentina. She was born in Ronda, Malaga, Spain in 1902 and grew up there with her four sisters: Catherine, Mary, Mercedes and Carmen. Her father, Manuel Rojas Palmero, was a theater electrician, so from a very young age, she was in contact with the art world. Her mother died in 1917 so the family moved to Casablanca for economic reasons.In 1925, she appeared at the Romea Theatre of Madrid before touring Mexico and Cuba. In 1929, she sang the song \"Botarate\" in Mosaico criollo, a film by Comminetti Edmo, which was the first tango sung in film. She died in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1987."

  "text" : "Annie Katsura Rollins is an American artist, scenic designer, and puppeteer. She specializes in traditional Chinese shadow puppetry. Rollins grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her mother is of Chinese and Japanese ancestry. Annie spent a semester in China during high school. She earned a BFA in music theatre from Carnegie Mellon University in 2002 and earned her MFA in scenography from the University of Minnesota in 2010. During the summer of 2008, Rollins apprenticed with Master Wei of the Hua Xian Shadow Troupe in Shaanxi province. There she learned techniques of carving and animating figures, publishing a blog about her experiences. Rollins was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship in 2011 and spent a year in China apprenticing in traditional Chinese shadow puppetry. She had read a 2010 New York Times interview with Chinese shadow puppetry masters Cui and Wang. Rollins visited Cui and Wang's shadow figure museum in Beijing as well as seven provinces that had historically specialized in shadow puppetry. She took lessons in manipulating shadow puppets from the master of the Zhonghua Shadow Company along with many others. While in Beijing, Rollins created and performed two shadow bike tours. She apprenticed with Master Shi of Gansu Province and Master Liu of Tengchong County. After her return to the United States, Rollins created the full-length work There's Nothing to Tell (没有什么可说) and performed it at the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre in Minneapolis. It combines Chinese shadow play with North American style and presents the story of a Chinese grandmaster shadow puppeteer whose life story, spanning the Cultural Revolution through modern times, is told by his granddaughter. Rollins has worked with the Ballard Institute and Museum of Puppetry, Taiwan's Taiyuan Puppet Company, and the Droomtheatre in the Netherlands. Rollins was artistic director for the Continental Divide Festival's Puppet Pageant for its first two years. She created the set for Carl Flink's dance piece Black Label Movement. Rollins did costume and set design for Ananya Chatterjea's Moreechika: Season of Mirage where her shadow puppets were projected onto the rear wall during performances at The Southern Theater. She also designed puppets for a puppet adaptation of the Harlem Renaissance play The Purple Flower. She has also taught DIY Shadow Puppetry workshops at Open Eye Figure Theatre in Minneapolis and the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta. During her time in Los Angeles, Rollins had a brief acting career, appearing in the 2006 film Americanese and the series Curb Your Enthusiasm, Big Day, Threshold and the musical short Damn the Past!, among others. Rollins lives in Montreal where she is pursuing an interdisciplinary PhD in the Humanities at Concordia University. She is the creator of the informational website chineseshadowpuppetry.com."

  "text" : "Arthur Wallis Exell OBE (21 May 1901 in Birmingham – 15 January 1993 in Cheltenham) was initially an assistant and later Deputy Keeper of Botany at the British Museum during the years 1924–1939 and 1950–1962. A noted cryptographer, taxonomist and phytogeographer, he was notable for his furthering of botanical exploration in tropical and sub-tropical Africa, and was an authority on the family Combretaceae. Exell's formal education started at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Warwickshire, and then King Edmund's School in Birmingham. From there he went on to Emmanuel College, Cambridge and was awarded an M.A. in 1926, having joined the British Museum as a second-class assistant on 11 August 1924, eventually becoming Deputy Keeper of Botany in 1950. He was entrusted with the Polypetalae, although his first paper was a morphological study of the hymenium in three species of fungus. Exell's first contact with Africa was in 1932/3 when he travelled to the islands in the Gulf of Guinea – São Tomé and Principe, Bioko and Annobon. His reports on the expedition were published in 1944 as a \"Catalogue of the Vascular Plants of S. Tome\", which for many years served as the standard reference to the islands' flora. The expedition also acquainted Exell with the Portuguese botanists Luis Carrisso and Francisco de Ascensão Mendonça of Coimbra University. Accompanied by them and his wife, Exell launched into a study of the flora of Angola, at that time a Portuguese colony. Also in their group was John Gossweiler (1873–1952), the government botanist in Angola. During the journey Carrisso suffered a fatal heart attack. Exell continued his collaboration with Coimbra University and Mendonça, publishing the first volume of the \"Conspectus Florae Angolensis\" (1937–1951). During the Second World War, Exell's knowledge of Portuguese – he was also fluent in French and German – led to his being seconded to the Government Communications Headquarters at Bletchley Park, and working as a cryptographer in Cheltenham. Returning to the British Museum (Natural History) in 1950, he founded the 'Association pour l'Etude Taxonomique de la Flore d'Afrique Tropicale' (AETFAT) and started the Flora Zambesiaca project, the flora covering the catchment area of the Zambesi River, which at the time comprised the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Bechuanaland, the Caprivi strip and Mozambique. He visited the region in 1955 with Mendonça to make further collections. He was co-editor of Flora Zambesiaca from 1962 onwards, and was awarded a D.Sc. by the University of Coimbra in Portugal in 1962. In 1971 the Portuguese government conferred on him the 'Comendador Da Ordem De Santiago da Espada'. He also received the Order of the British Empire in 1961, and was a member of the Linnean Society of London and other scientific societies. Exell left the British Museum as Deputy Keeper of Botany in 1962. Working from home, he carried out part-time work for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. On his retirement, he and his wife moved to the village of Blockley in the Cotswolds, becoming involved in local affairs. The standard author abbreviation Exell is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Alexander Sambugnac was a Yugoslav-American artist and sculptor. He was born April 22, 1888 in Zimony, Kingdom of Hungary (today Zemun, Serbia). He studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest, Hungary and Munich, Germany where he studied under Franz von Stuck. In 1913, he went to Paris and studied with Antoine Bourdelle. His sculptures were commission for U.S. Post Offices for a Great Depression era program overseen by the U.S. Treasury Department. His work is also at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, at a cathedral in Vienna, Austria and at the capitol in Havana, Cuba. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1938 and was a member of the Architectural League of New York and the National Sculpture Society. Sambugnac's sculptures are at the David W. Dyer Federal Building and United States Courthouse where he crafted two cast-stone lunettes in 1938. The low-relief panels portray two allegorical figures representing themes of the spirit of justice on the lintels above the leather-covered doors. Love and Hope shows a young woman playing the lyre, while Wisdom and Courage depicts a seated figure gazing at a tablet of the law. His work in Cuba was for a memorial for Jose Marti."

He is a recognized expert in marine knowledge who currently (from 1999 to the present) is serving as Marine Consultant to the Premier's Ministry, Nevis Air and Sea Ports Authority, Nevis Island Administration (NIA), and Marine Advisor to the Premier's Ministry, NIA. Over the years, Anslyn has received numerous awards, both for his service to the community and for his bravery in saving lives and property in extreme situations. Anslyn was honoured with the insignia of a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1985. He has been very active over the years in search and rescue, marine ambulance service, and other marine emergency services on Nevis. Using scuba, he took part in the underwater survey for the official inquiry after the 1970 Christena disaster, a ferry boat shipwreck which involved a great loss of life. Anslyn was captain of the Carib Queen ferryboat for 19 years, and was subsequently the Director of Fisheries at the NIA for many years. Brother Anslyn lives in Charlestown, the capital of Nevis. His family name was originally Anslijn, of Dutch extraction: he has family ties to Saba, a Dutch island which lies north of Sint Eustatius. In 1995, a reporter for the St. Kitts and Nevis Observer commented, \"...he's one of those rare individuals who not only performs a public service...but also touch[es] the lives of so many of us\" and, \"We are fortunate to have someone like Brother among us\"."

  "text" : "Amelia Rose Earhart (born 1983, Downey, California) is a private pilot and traffic and weather news presenter for NBC affiliate in Denver, Colorado, where she resides. In 2013 Earhart started the Fly With Amelia Foundation, which grants flight scholarships to girls aged 16–18. Earhart was told by family members in her youth that she was a descendant of Amelia Mary Earhart. When she was in college, she hired a genealogist to research her connection to Amelia Earhart. That genealogist told her that she and Amelia shared a \"distant common ancestry traced back to the 1700s\", however a second genealogical search in 2013 found there was no traceable connection. Earhart took her first flying lesson on June 2, 2004, and obtained her private pilot licence in a Cessna 172. In 2012, she recreated her namesake's transcontinental flight from Oakland, California to Miami, Florida in a Cirrus SR22, as a completion of her instrument training hours. In July 2013 she was awarded the Amelia Earhart Pioneering Achievement Award by the Atchison, Kansas Chamber of Commerce. The award is given to the woman who carries on Amelia Earhart's spirit. In partnership with Denver’s Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum, Earhart completed a circumnavigation of the globe in a single-engine airplane with her copilot, Shane Jordan. Her route was to fly across the US, then south into the Caribbean, northeast Brazil, the South Atlantic Ocean, then the African continent, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Islands, and the Pacific Ocean before returning to California. Earhart and Jordan started the global circumnavigation flight on June 26, 2014, departing Oakland, California at 8:19 am Pacific Standard Time in a single engine Pilatus PC-12 NG. They made 17 stops during the 24,300 nautical-mile trip over 108 flying hours, landing back in Oakland without incident on July 11, 2014. Although widely reported (and claiming) to have become the youngest woman to fly around the world, she is in fact the second youngest behind Richarda Morrow-Tait, who was also the first woman to pilot a plane around the globe. On July 9, 2014 as she and her mentor pilot were flying over Howland Island she announced, via Twitter, the names of the first recipients of the Fly With Amelia foundation flight training scholarships."

His writing on the Arab-Israeli conflict and Jewish history has been published in numerous international newspapers, including The Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Guardian, The National Post (Canada), and The Jerusalem Post. Ryvchin is a regular columnist for The Spectator. Ryvchin is an outspoken critic of the anti-Israel movement referring to its activists as \"self-righteous westerners\" with \"pretentions to heroism\" who seek \"redemption\" by \"slaying the Zionist beast\". He has spoken publicly of his love for Australia and his support for multiculturalism and integration which Ryvchin argues requires that \"we accept the duty to uphold the freedoms granted to us and to protect the values underpinning our society - values such as democracy, tolerance, mutual respect.\" He is a frequent guest on Sky TV's the Middle East Report. In May 2013, Ryvchin was appointed Director of Public Affairs at the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. He currently resides in Sydney, Australia with his wife."

  "text" : "Albert van den Berg (born 20 September 1957) is a Dutch physicist who works on nanotechnology-miniaturization in physics, chemistry, biology and biotechnology (nanofluidics, nanosensors, Lab on a chip (LOC)). Van den Berg was born in Zaandam. In 1988 he earned his PhD at the University of Twente with a thesis on chemically modified ISFETs. Then until 1993 he worked at the Centre Suisse d’Electronique et de Microtechnique (CSEM) in Neuchâtel and the Institut de microtechnique (IMT) at the University of Neuchâtel. During this time he worked mainly on miniaturized chemical sensors. From 1993 to 1999 he was director of research for Micro Total Analysis Systems (TAS, i.e. miniaturized systems for chemical analysis) and Miniaturized Chemical Systems (MiCS) at the Institute for Nanotechnology (MESA+) at the University of Twente. In 1998 he had a part-time professorship and from 2000 a full professorship. In 2003 he became head of nanofluidics within the Dutch national nanotechnology program (NanoNed). Van den Berg has co-authored over 250 scientific publications (H=44) and over 10 patents. He is or has been involved with 6 spin-off companies. In 2002 he won the Simon Stevin Master Award of the Dutch Society of Science and Engineering. In 2009 he won the Spinoza Prize, the most prestigious Dutch science prize. As there was no fourth Spinoza Prize awarded in 2009, Van den Berg and his co-winners Michel Ferrari and Marten Scheffer asked the NWO to reward them the remaining prize money, which they would spend on a collaborative research effort. Their efforts culminated in a research paper on migraine published in PLOS ONE in 2013. The paper claimed that a critical tipping point of neurons started a migraine attack. He is a member of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences and its council."

  "text" : "Anders Jensen Horgen (11 March 1861 – 2 June 1947) was a Norwegian farmer and politician for the Labour, Social Democratic Labour and Communist parties. He was born as Anders Jensen in Hokksund as a son of fisher Jens Jakob Paulsen (1832–1865) and Regine Christensdatter (1831–1913). After basic schooling he worked in timber floating and timber trade, commencing merchantry in his homedistrict Øvre Eiker in 1898. In 1902 he moved to the farm Horgen in Nedre Eiker, running it for the rest of his life. He was supposedly converted to socialism in 1888 after participating in the liberal workers' movement, where he met and heard Christian Holtermann Knudsen and Christopher Hornsrud. He was first elected to Øvre Eiker municipal council in 1898, and served as mayor from 1907 to 1916. He first fielded for parliamentary election in 1909. With shoemaker Bøhmer as his running mate, he carried the sub-constituencies Nedre Eiker, Røken and Hurum, but lost Lier to Conservative candidate Torger Holtsmark with quite a margin. In total Horgen had 1,904 votes compared to Holtsmark's 2,056, so a second round was necessary. Here, Holtsmark edged out Horgen with 2,951 to 2,504 votes. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from the constituency Buskerud in 1912, 1915 and 1918, serving three terms. In 1921 he joined the new Social Democratic Labour Party, and headed their ballot in Buskerud in the 1921. The party got the least votes, and he was not elected. By 1930, the two parties had merged, but Horgen had instead joined the Communist Party. He stood on second place on their unprevailing ballot in the 1930 election. He died in June 1947."

  "text" : "Adriaan \"Ad\" Dekkers (Nieuwpoort, South Holland, 21 March 1938 – Gorinchem, 27 February 1974) was as Dutch artist mostly known for his reliefs involving simple geometrical forms. Dekkers was born to Hendrik Pieter Dekkers, a school principal, and Anna Elizabeth Berdina Godtschalk. Adrian attended his father's school and also received training as a decorative painter. Between 1954 and 1958 he studied at the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam where he was mostly engaged in drawing of landscapes and still images. In February 1960 Dekkers entered military service, and in December 1961 married Machelina Hendrika van Bruggen, with whom he had one son. From the early 1960s Dekkers became dissatisfied with painting and focused on reliefs, mostly made of plastic. By 1968 he was recognized as a master in this area and started creating monumental sculptures and reliefs in architectural environment. His works became accepted at major international exhibitions, such as the Biennale de Paris in 1965, São Paulo Art Biennial in 1967 and documenta in Kassel in 1968. He also had a number of solo exhibitions in the Netherlands. After his death in 1974, his works were exhibited in Eindhoven and Düsseldorf and placed in museums in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, England and the United States."

He was born in 903, and was the son of Muhammad ibn Harun, an Arab from the Muhallabi family. Al-Muhallabi later served as the administrator of Ahvaz, and soon began serving the Buyids who were the new masters of Iraq and western Iran. Al-Muhallabi quickly rose as a prominent figure at the Buyid court, and later became the companion of Abu Ja'far Saymari, the chief secretary of Mu'izz al-Dawla, who was the Buyid ruler of Iraq. In 950/951, Mu'izz al-Dawla appointed as Muhallabi his vizier and gave him the title of ostadh. In 950/951, Mu'izz al-Dawla, after constant conflict against the Batihah ruler 'Imran ibn Shahin, sent an army under the joint command of al-Muhallabi and the Dailamite general Ruzbahan. Ruzbahan, who disliked al-Muhallabi, convinced him to directly attack 'Imran. He kept his forces in the rear and fled as soon as fighting between the two sides began. 'Imran used the terrain effectively, laying ambushes and confusing al-Muhallabi's army. Many of the al-Muhallabi's soldiers died in the fighting and he himself only narrowly escaped capture, swimming to safety. Mu'izz al-Daula then came to terms with 'Imran, acceding to his terms. Prisoners were exchanged and 'Imran was made a vassal of the Buyids, being instated as governor of the Batihah. Al-Muhallabi died in 963 after having received a sickness during his campaign in Oman. According to Ibn Miskawayh, however, al-Muhallabi was poisoned by Mu'izz al-Dawla."

Beginning in 1898 he worked as a volunteer at the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna, later attaining the role of curator. At the museum, he specialized in the field of arachnology. In 1894–96 he conducted zoological and botanical investigations in South Africa and Rhodesia. Ornithological specimens collected on the expedition were donated to the natural history museum in Vienna, and many of the plants he collected on the trip became part of the Vienna herbarium. Later on in his career, he embarked on scientific expeditions to Asia Minor, Mesopotamia and the Balkan Peninsula. The genus Pentheriella (family Asteraceae, synonym Heteromma) was named in his honor by Karl August Otto Hoffmann and Reinhold Conrad Muschler, and taxa with the specific epithet of pentheri are named after him, an example being Rhus pentheri."

  "text" : "Adolf Bierbrauer grew up with two sisters, Marianne and Gisela, in the Glücksburger street in Düsseldorf-Oberkassel. His father was manager of the ironworks Association in Düsseldorf. During his high school years Bierbrauer went through a deep personal crisis. In 1925 his piano teacher detected him the philosophical work of Rudolf Steiner. In 1930 Bierbrauer produced his first still life. One year later, first figurative drawings followed. In the age of eighteen he performed in puplic as piano soloist. He also produced numerous portraits of people from his neighborhood. In 1934 he traveled to the Goetheanum in Dornach (Switzerland) to study the works of Rudolf Steiner. In 1935, he began a study of medicine at the University of Marburg. In 1937 he moves to Freiburg to continue his studies. In 1939, he continued in the study in Jena and at the Medical Academy in Düsseldorf. From 1940-1942 he served in military service in France. 1942 Bierbrauer was called back to Düsseldorf due to the lack of troops doctors there in World War II, in order to make here his medical state examination. He finished his studies with a doctorate in 1943. In January 1945 he was sent as military doctor to the Eastern Front. He was captured in Wroclaw and transported to Transcaucasia (Mingitschaur) to work as a roadbuilder and concrete worker as Russian prisoner of war. During his imprisonment, on behalf of the prisoner-of-war camp management Bierbrauer painted documentary images of geological investigations of the terminal moraines. The prisoners also worked on archaeological excavations of medean graves. Biebrauer opposed the supports and retained some drawings. His paintings then was forbiddden. Instead he was ordered to create portraits of the guards. In 1949, he came back to Düsseldorf and started as a volunteer physician in Hamburg at the University Hospital. From 1951 to 1953 he worked as psychotherapist at the 2nd Medical Academy in Düsseldorf, specializing in hypnosis treatments. The first hypnosis paintings emerged. His public engagement against electroshock therapy and insulin shock treatments lead to his release from hospital in 1953/1954. In the summer semester, he attended the class \"monumental painting and wall painting\" under the direction of Otto Gerster at the Kölner Werkschulen. He applied at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf where he is rejected. In 1954 he received the circular medical certificate to establish himself as a general medical practitioner. Bierbrauer now specialized on nervous disorders and psychosomatic disorders. He enhanced the therapies applying also hypnosis. After 1960, the first somnambulistic paintings emerge. A heart attack in 1965 forced Bierbrauer to end working as a doctor. In the year 1973, he declared himself to be a freelance artist and started painting lessons for children at his home. These lessions later became the first Waldorf kindergarten in Düsseldorf. Bierbrauer also worked as a pianist in Waldorf schools. In 1974 he applied again at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where he remained for nearly two years. At the same time he attended lectures of philosophy at Heinz Rudolf at the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf. Starting in 1990, Bierbrauer started which art he calls Müllkunst (trash art). 1998 Bierbrauer moved to the anthroposophically oriented Heinrich-Zschokke Senior house in Düsseldorf-Gerresheim, that he also initiated. In 2000, his works have been presented to the general public during the presentation of his monography at the NRW Forum for the first time. Bazon Brock and Gabriele Lohberg, Director of the Europäische Kunstakademie Trier (European Academy of Fine Arts Trier) held the introduction speeches.(1) Life in anthroposophic Senior home became intolerable to him. During unannounced renovations in his care rooms artworks are destroyed.(2) He decided in 2006 to change senior house in the age of 91 years and moved to the Kasierwerther Diakonie, Ratingen. In the year 2012 Bierbrauer personally witnessed his hypnosis works in the exhibition \"The Great,\" at the Museum Kunst Palast Düsseldorf. In the autumn of the same year Bierbrauer died of heart failure.(3)"

  "text" : "Anna Maria Clodt (died 1708), was a Swedish courtier. She served as a Danish agent at the Swedish Royal Court and was widely reputed and consulted by supplicants for her contacts and acquired a great deal of influence.

She served as lady-in-waiting to Queen Hedvig Eleonora in 1668-1680, Queen Ulrika Eleonora in 1680-1693 and to Princess Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden in 1693-1708. She used her position as a courtier by creating a net of influential contacts, which she could use to forward requests and make recommendations from supplicants to power holders at court in exchange for money. This was a common way for a female courtier to earn money, but Clodt was very successful in her line of business, especially since she was somewhat of a favorite of Queen Ulrika Eleonora. Already in 1673, she stated in a letter that she was consulted so often by clients that she had grown weary of it. She also accepted foreign clients, which in fact made her a spy: she acted as an informer of Bolle Luxdorph, (Danish envoy to Sweden in 1691-1698)."

  "text" : "Arthur Benjamin Postle (8 March 1881 – 21 April 1965) was an Australian professional athlete, one of the country's most renowned sprinters in the early twentieth century. Born in Queensland and becoming a professional runner in 1902, Postle rose to prominence for the defeat of Beauchamp Day – then an Irish world champion – at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia in December 1906. Known thereafter as 'The Crimson Flash' for his coloured running costume, Postle also acquired the moniker 'The Mighty Postle' for his defeat of Bill Growcott two years later in England, Growcott being England's champion runner. Postle's career took him throughout the United Kingdom and to New Zealand as well as across Australia, where he had a rivalry with fellow Australian champion Jack Donaldson. Postle set world records for fifty, sixty, seventy-five, eighty and two-hundred yard sprints during his career, which ended in 1913 a year after his marriage to an Englishwoman. He ventured into business, and then became a farmer until full-retirement during the Second World War. He had four children who all survived him upon his death in Brisbane. Edward Seldon Sears wrote that Postle, together with Donaldson, had \"few peers among sprinters of their day\" and since his retirement he has been consider one of \"the greatest of all Australian runners.\""

  "text" : "Alain Devaquet (born 1942) is a French politician who was a minister under Jacques Chirac. A university professor before embarking on his political career with the Rally for the Republic, Devaquet was given the role of junior minister for universities. In this role he became the public face of a controversial proposal to reform the higher education system in 1986, the proposals becoming known as the Devaquet Law, despite originating from more senior members of the government. The plan essentially focused on allowing universities to be more selective in the admission of students and to charge fees. The reaction against the proposals was strong, with mass protests by students and some strikes in support of their opposition. With the mobilisation of students also closely linked to other proposals aimed at tightening immigration laws, things came to a head with the death of Malik Oussekine, a student protester who died in police custody on 6 December 1986 and whose death prompted mass outpouring of anger.

Following these statements arose a religious movement that has mobilized thousands of people who go to the place of Marian apparitions. She was called \"El Escorial seer\" referring to the village where Amparo claimed that apparitions were there. These apparitions have not yet been recognized by the Catholic Church and have created controversy that has reached the courts. All that after 1981 came around these events has been described by some people as «business and destructive sect»."

After studying in Turin, she attended the ballet school at La Scala Academy, under the direction of the Carlo Blasis; she debuted in Milan. Ferraris danced at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples and then throughout Europe. In 1848, she joined the Theatre Royal in London, and performed on the occasion of The Great Exhibition. After successful performances in London (1853), Rome (1854), and Vienna (1855), Ferraris performed at the Paris Opera in 1856. Together with Carolina Rosati, her artistic rival, Ferraris was one of the most notable Italian dancers of her era. In 1857, she performed with Rosati at the Paris Opera in the ballet Marco Spada, ou La Fille du Bandit;it was said to have been commissioned by Napoleon III for Ferraris and Rosati, who was considered to be the most celebrated ballerinas at the time. Along with Rosati, Giuseppina Bozzacchi, and Fanny Cerrito, Ferraris was considered an Italian virtuosity, known for \"bravura displays of technique\". In 1859 she made her debut with the Imperial Ballet, St. Petersburg where she performed in several ballets. It was for Ferraris that the choreographer Marius Petipa created the Carnaval In Venice pas de deux to music by Cesare Pugni, which the composer based on Niccolò Paganini's Il Carnevale di Venezia as an ode to the Italian ballerina. The pas de deux was latter added to the ballet Satanella in 1866 where it acquired its more well-known title, the Satanella pas de deux. This pas de deux is still performed throughout the world today."

  "text" : "Andrea di Bonaiuto da Firenze or Andrea da Firenze (I) (active 1343 – 1377) was an Italian painter active in Florence. He was probably born in Florence where he was active from 1343. His earliest works suggest that he must have been in close contact with the workshop of Andrea di Cione. Andrea di Bonaiuto is known for his stained glass window of the Coronation of Mary in the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, and his fresco decorations in the Spanish chapel (then called Cappellone degli Spagnoli) of the chapter house there. The central theme of the fresco's in the Spanish chapel is the glorification of the Dominican Order. From mid 1366 to mid 1367 Andrea di Bonaiuto was one of the artists advising on the construction of the Florence Cathedral. He died in Pisa while working on a fresco on the Legend of St Raneiro at the Camposanto Monumentale. Although a follower of traditional models, Andrea di Bonaiuto brought innovation by softening details and contours with soft and blended shadows and emphasizing the two-dimensional aspect of the painted surface through painted and punched decorative effects."

  "text" : "Anyer Antonio Blanco is a Cuban dissident, whose anti-regime activities are based in his hometown of Santiago, where he was born July 28, 1987. He has served six years as a self-described political prisoner in Cuban jails until his release in 2012. Blanco is one of the few users of Twitter in Cuba. Havana-based fellow dissident Yoani Sánchez's Twitter account has been \"certified\" and who constantly tweets and uploads videos from within Cuba against the regime, activity which has been recognized outside Cuba. Born in 1987 in Santiago, he was sentenced to six years in jail after an illegal attempt to leave the country. While in prison, he survived two self-imposed hunger strikes. Dissident groups demonstrated near his prison while he was on hunger strike. Karen Caballero, of TV Martí, describes him as one of the highest profile Cuban dissidents at this time. Pro-Cuban regime bloggers single him out and criticize his activities and he has been described by one as \"the most promising young man in the internal counterrevolutionary movement\" in Cuba. These bloggers follow and describe in detail Anyer Antonio Blanco's extensive travels throughout the world. In June 2013, Blanco, National Youth Coordinator for the Cuban Patriotic Union (UNPACU), met with former Polish President Lech Walesa in Warsaw and in October of that year was invited by the Vaclav Havel Institute to speak about democracy-building in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In October 2014, Blanco participated in the Rising Star Program sponsored by International Republican Institute held in Prague, Czech Republic. He also represented UNPACU at the World Movement for Democracy 8th Assembly held in Seoul, Korea in 2015, and represented UNPACU at the Organization of American States (OAS) meeting held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic in June, 2016. He has also traveled several times to the United States, including the nation's capital, the Miami, Florida area and San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he now spends several months of the year studying as a senior at Sacred Heart University, when not residing in Santiago de Cuba. During his travels, he has met with several prominent figures, including Walesa, U.S. representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Mario Díaz-Balart, Pedro Pierluisi and Joe García, Obama administration official Ben Rhodes, former representative Lincoln Díaz-Balart, former Puerto Rico Secretaries of State David Bernier and Kenneth McClintock. During the civil unrest in several Venezuelan cities in February 2014, pro-Castro bloggers identified Yoani Sánchez, former Colombian president Alvaro Uribe, UNPACU leader Jose Daniel Ferrer and Anyer Blanco as being allies of Venezuelan dissidents. Mr. Blanco adopted a moderate response to the first steps to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba announced by U.S. President Barack Obama on December 17, 2014, in keeping with UNPACU's policy."

  "text" : "Andrew Christopher Albury, born 20 November 1961, is an Australian murderer. Convicted of murdering Gloria Pindan on 25 November 1983, he is currently serving two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment without parole. Albury also confessed to the killing of Patricia Carlton, but later recanted the confession at the trial of Kelvin Condren. Condren was convicted and served seven years before his conviction was quashed. In 1990, Albury confessed to committing eleven other murders but an investigation concluded that the confession was fictional. In the same judgement, Dr. Wake, the Medical Director of Northern Territory Prisons, is quoted as saying: 'Albury enjoys his reputation of being a “monster” and cleverly invokes voices, the written word and behaviour patterns to perpetuate the idea that he is quite mad\"'. In 1990, he received a consecutive sentence of detention in hospital for life after assaulting and attempting to strangle a fellow inmate. In February 2014, former Northern Territory Detective Sergeant Les Chapman, who arrested Albury in 1983, claimed that Albury had boasted to him of killing 14 other people in a spree while he moved from Townsville to Mount Isa between 1970 and 1982, possibly making Albury one of the youngest serial killers in history and also the most prolific serial killer in Australian history, ahead of Snowtown serial killers John Bunting and Robert Wagner."

  "text" : "Arthur Chu (born January 30, 1984) is an American columnist and former contestant on the syndicated US game show Jeopardy!. Chu first became known for the unusual style of play he adopted during his 11-game winning streak on Jeopardy!. When the shows aired, Chu attracted criticism from many for jumping from category to category rather than selecting clues in sequential order, a strategy known as the \"Forrest Bounce\", after former champion Chuck Forrest. Chu prepared extensively before his Jeopardy! appearance by reviewing tapes, study guides, game theory and Jeopardy! strategy. He made his debut on the January 28, 2014, winning $37,000 in his first game. After winning 11 games, he lost his 12th game (which aired on March 12, 2014) to Diana Peloquin. Chu is the fourth highest-earning Jeopardy! champion in non-tournament gameplay, with a grand total of $298,200. Chu also won an additional $100,000 for taking second place in the 2014 Tournament of Champions. Since appearing on Jeopardy!, Chu has used his fame to speak out publicly on issues that are important to him. He has become a columnist and Internet commentator, and currently writes for The Daily Beast and Salon on various issues, including racism and sexism in nerd culture."

In the period 1966-1989 he was the head and lecturer of the postgraduate course on museology. He collected art, art-historical literature, documents and materials, having contributed with his own collections to the establishment of numerous museums and gallery institutions in Croatia: Gipsoteka (1937), Archive of Fine Arts as part of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Museum Documentation Center (1955), Art Gallery in Osijek (1941), and the Art Gallery within the Vukovar City Museum (1959). The collection \"Bauer\" is regarded as one of the most comprehensive collections of Croatian art of the 19th and the 20th century.

He took part in the Operation Ostra Brama as commanding officer of the East group attacking the city of Vilna from the direction of Nowa Wilejka and Belmont. After the success of the operation and the arrest of most of the commanders of the Polish forces by the Soviet NKVD, Olechnowicz was one of the few officers to evade capture and assumed the role of the new commanding officer of the Vilna Home Army Area. In the summer of 1945 he evacuated his headquarters to Central Poland. Arrested by the communist authorities, he was sentenced to death in a show trial and buried in an unmarked grave. During his service in the underground, he used a variety of noms de guerre, including \"Meteor\", \"Kurkowski\", \"Pohorecki\", \"Lawicz\", \"Krzysztof\", \"Roman Wrzeski\" and \"Kurcewicz\"."

  "text" : "Anna Maria Di Sciullo is a full professor in the Linguistics Department and Associate professor in the Cognitive Computation PhD program at the University of Quebec at Montreal. Di Sciullo’s work has focused on the role of symmetry, asymmetry and symmetry breaking in the understanding of the Language Faculty and the interfaces with the external systems. Her contributions to theoretical linguistics are centered on asymmetry as a cornerstone of the Language Faculty and on the asymmetry preserving principles reducing the complexity brought about by experience. Her research on the asymmetry of morphological relations provides a further understanding of the regularity of form and interpretation of word internal argument, aspect and operator structures. Her work in biolinguistics points to the pervasiveness of symmetry breaking in language ontogeny as well as in patterns of variance in phylogeny. Di Sciullo’s work in computational linguistics led to the formulation of the Asymmetry Recovering Parser, generating deterministic parses for linguistic expressions. She developed a search engine sensitive to asymmetric relations, which has been used by the Government of Quebec to search and retrieve online legal information. Her work on the interface between the Language Faculty and mathematics led to the engineering of a sentiment mining system based on a compositional calculus applied to asymmetric relations. Since 1998, she has directed major collaborative research projects funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and by the Fonds de recherche du Québec. She has received numerous research awards, among which the Research Award of the Board of Directors of the University of Quebec in 2001. In 2004 she founded the Federation on Natural Language Processing, bringing together the main actors in the area of theoretical linguistics, computational linguistics and information technology, and in 2007 she founded the International Network on Biolinguistics, bridging biology, linguistics and bioinformatics."

  "text" : "Adam Cusack (c.1630–1681) was an Irish barrister and judge of the seventeenth century. He was born in Rathgar (then a village, now a suburb of Dublin city), the second son of Robert Cusack of Rathgar Castle (which Adam inherited on the death of his elder brother) and his wife Alice, daughter of Sir George Sexton of Limerick. He was the grandson of John Cusack, Lord Mayor of Dublin 1608-9. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and became a fellow of the college in 1654. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1655, was called to the Bar in 1660, and entered the King's Inn in 1661. He was appointed second justice of the provincial court of Connacht in 1661 and became the last Chief Justice of Connacht in 1670. On the abolition of that office in 1672 he was appointed a justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland); in the relaxed political atmosphere of the early 1670s his Anglo-Irish background and tolerant attitude to Roman Catholics were not a political disadvantage. He had also the advantage of having married Catherine Keating, sister of John Keating, later to be Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas and niece of Maurice Eustace, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. The only possible objection to his appointment to the Bench was on the grounds of ill health: from early middle age onwards he suffered badly from gout, which became so acute that he was unable to perform his judicial duties for at least two years. He died, aged only about 50, in 1681, and was buried in St. Audoen's Church, Dublin. In his will, which, according to Elrington Ball, shows his kindly and charitable nature, he left money to the poor of St. Audoen's parish and of Rathfarnham, for the relief of poor prisoners, and bequests to the Bluecoat School at Oxmantown and to the army hospital at Back Lane, Dublin. The bulk of his estate was left to his widow Catherine, who remarried his cousin Nicholas Cusack; she and Adam had no children. Rathgar Castle fell into decay in the eighteenth century, and was a ruin by 1769, when the Dutch-born artist Gabriel Beranger did a watercolour of the remains. The Castle probably stood on present day Highfield Road, at or near the present site of St. Luke's Hospital, Rathgar."

At the age of 28, Sapienza left Russia for Naples to continue his musical studies at the conservatory there with Giacomo Tritto, Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli and Pietro Generali, during which time he composed two Masses, several motets and a Salve regina. He remained in Italy for six years and composed three operas for the Neapolitan theatres which were well-received in their day. According to the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, he was also one of the several composers who produced the dramatic cantata, La fondazione di Partenope, performed at the Teatro San Carlo on 12 January 1824 to celebrate the birthday of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. Sapienza returned to St. Petersburg in 1828 where he served as choir master and conductor at the Imperial Theatre until his death in 1855."

After the death of Adud al-Dawla in 983, the Buyid Empire was thrown into civil war; the Empire was disputed between his two sons Samsam al-Dawla and Sharaf al-Dawla. Samsam al-Dawla ruled Iraq, while Sharaf al-Dawla ruled Fars and Kerman. In 986, Asfar rebelled against Samsam al-Dawla, and changed his allegiance to Sharaf al-Dawla. However, Asfar quickly changed his mind, and declared allegiance to the latter's other brother Abu Nasr Firuz Kharshadh, who was shortly given the laqab of \"Baha' al-Dawla.\" However, Samsam al-Dawla, with the aid of Fuladh ibn Manadhar, suppressed the rebellion, and imprisoned Baha al-Dawla.

Top three placings at the PSD Bank Meeting and Weltklasse in Karlsruhe at the start of the next year brought her a place on the team for the 2014 IAAF World Indoor Championships in the 1500 metres event.

  "text" : "Anmanari Brown is an Australian Aboriginal artist. She was one of the pioneers of the art movement across the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara lands, which began in 2000. Since then, her paintings have gained much success. Her work is held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the Queensland Art Gallery, and the National Gallery of Australia. Brown was born roughly some time during the 1930s. She was born at Purpurna, a waterhole that is sacred to the Pitjantjatjara. She grew up living a traditional, nomadic way of life in the bush with her family, before any contact with Euro-Australian society. In the 1950s, her family was moved out of the bush to live at Warburton, with many other Aboriginal families. Warburton was a Christian mission at the time, and Brown was taught at school here by missionaries. When she was older, Brown moved to Irrunytju and married Nyakul Dawson. Brown began work as an artist in 2000. The women of Irrunytju had opened an art centre as a community-owned economic program. Anmanari and other senior women in the community began painting for Irrunytju Arts on linen canvases. Their first exhibition was held in 2001, in Perth. The art mixed modern painting techniques with ancient designs and cultural law. From the beginning of her career, Brown often painted with her friend Tjayanka Woods. When Brown's husband died in 2007, she and Woods left Irrunytju and went to live at Papulankutja, on Ngaanyatjarra lands. Here, they paint for Papulankutja Artists. In April 2010, the two women held their first solo exhibition together at the Vivien Anderson Gallery in Melbourne. Brown mostly paints the Kungkarrakalpa Tjukurpa (Seven Sisters Dreaming). Her connection to this Dreaming comes from her mother, whose homeland is Kuru Ala, a sacred place for women. The paintings in her solo show depicted stories from this Dreaming. Brown's paintings are not figurative. She does not explicitly depict figures or features of the landscape, but she does use iconographic symbols to represent them. She uses patterned lines to represent tracks in a journey, or seven small shapes or lines to represent the sisters. She also sometimes uses colour symbolically. While Brown mainly paints directly on canvas, several of her works are made from screen-printing methods."

In November 1755, He was born to Garja Singh and Harnam Kaur at Village Naurang Singh Wala, Zira, Ferozpur. At age of 68, He became Jathedar of Akal Takhat. After defeat of Khalsa against British, Jathedar decided to re-group nihang singh fauj against the Britishers at the Patiala Chauni. Raja Karam Singh was ruler of Patiala and other Malwa Kingdom was in alliance with British. There were strict orders to shoot Nihangs on sight. When Jathedar Hanuman Singh arrived at Patiala, Raja Karam Singh launched an cannon attack on Nihangs, in which around 32,000 nihang singhs were killed. Rest were forced to move to the forests nearby. Hanuman Singh and around 500 Nihang warriors survived this attack, and continued to fight the heavy cannon fire of the British, with swords, bows and arrows, axes and matchlock fire. Baba Hanuman Singh was wounded badly and died at Sohana, Mohali at the age of 90. He was succeeded by Jathedar Baba Parladh Singh Nihang Singh. His memorial, Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan, is situated in Sohana. A Kabaddi academy is present in Sohana in his name."

Regarded today as a feminist pragmatist, MacLean is particularly remembered for her pioneering work in participant observation, and for her rigorous application of her sociological findings to immediate social problems. She is particularly known for her studies of working and immigrant women. MacLean's work was strongly informed by her association with social reformers such as Jane Addams, as well as founding scholars of sociology such as Albion Small, Charles Henderson, and George Herbert Mead."

  "text" : "Andrea Ghisi was a Venetian nobleman, and the first Lord of Tinos and Mykonos. There are no sources about him until 1207 when he participated in the expedition organized by Marco Sanudo for the conquest of the Greek islands which, three years after the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade, had not yet been occupied by the victors. He is not to be confused with the 17th-century Andrea Ghisi, from the same family, who devised a game called Laberinto (\"Labyrinth\"). According to Andrea Dandolo, Andrea and his brother Geremia received together possession over Tinos, Mykonos, Skyros, Skopelos and Skiathos, and after the division of these possessions among themselves, Andrea obtained Tinos and Mykonos. The two brothers were not vassals of Sanudo's Duchy of Naxos, however, but directly under the Latin Empire. In 1243 he was engaged with his brother in a long dispute with the Republic of Venice. During the campaign of 1207, the island of Andros had been assigned to Marino Dandolo but at an unknown date (probably between 1238 and 1239), Geremia had seized it by force. Dandolo appealed to the Venetian government but died soon after. This, however, did not prevent the Great Council of Venice on 11 August 1243 from condemning the Ghisi brothers to confiscation of their property, and ordering the Doge of Venice Jacopo Tiepolo to force the restitution of the island. Andrea and Geremia were also ordered to present themselves before the Doge and submit to the Council's decision by 29 June 1244, on pain of exile from Venice and the auctioning of their possessions for the benefit of the dispossessed Dandolo family. The Ghisi probably continued their occupation of Andros, as it was more beneficial to them than the Republic's conditions. As Geremia died some time after August 1243, it was Andrea alone who was eventually exiled from Venice and his possessions auctioned off. By 1251, however, both sides softened their stance and Andrea resolved to submit to new and more lenient demands. From the terms of the agreement, it is clear that he was no longer in direct possession of Andros, which may have devolved to a vassal of the Duchy of Naxos. After fulfilling his obligations, on 28 March 1253, his exile was lifted by the Great Council, but the reclamation of his auctioned goods was long-drawn out affair; even in 1280, years after his death, some still had not been recovered. The last information about Andrea Ghisi comes from an act signed in 1266. He had died by 19 March 1277, when his son Bartholomew appears as lord of Tinos and Mykonos. Apart from Bartholomew, Andrea had six sons (of which only one Marino, survived him) and one daughter, Anfelise, who married Pietro Querini."

  "text" : "Ary Louis Goldberger (b. Bronx, New York City, May 29, 1949) is a physician-educator, whose collaborative research work is at the interface of biomedicine and complexity science (nonlinear dynamics). He holds a BA from Harvard College and an MD from Yale Medical School. He did his clinical training in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease at Yale–New Haven Hospital and at the University of California, San Diego, respectively. He currently serves as Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and was one of the Core Founding Faculty (2010-2015) of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. Goldberger is founding and current Principal Investigator (with R. G. Mark at MIT) of the NIH-sponsored Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals. The “Big Data” PhysioNet Resource is the first and remains the largest repository of free, open-access databases and open-source computational tools devoted to complex signals informatics. In addition, he is founding and current Director of the Margret and H.A. Rey Institute for Nonlinear Dynamics in Physiology and Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston. Goldberger is the senior author of two textbooks on clinical electrocardiography. He and his colleagues at BIDMC are developers of ECG Wave-Maven, the largest and most–widely used free teaching site for ECG self-assessment. He is also co-author of a recent book on critical thinking for students of medicine and their mentors. His scientific investigations focus on nonlinear mechanisms of healthy function and their alterations with pathology. He and his colleagues were the first to identify the fractal dynamics of the healthy heartbeat and describe alterations in fractal scaling with life-threatening conditions such as heart failure. Goldberger and colleagues originated and continue to elaborate the complexity-loss theory of aging and disease which is widely cited in basic science and clinical research. Some of this work was featured on the 2011 PBS-NOVA show: Hunting the Hidden Dimension. Among other honors, he is a recipient of the S. Robert Stone Award for Excellence in Teaching at Harvard Medical School/BIDMC and an Ellison Medical Foundation Senior Scholar in Aging Award. Goldberger and colleagues, R.G Mark and G.B. Moody, are recipients of the 2016 Laufman-Greatbatch Award from the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). This honor, the highest conferred by the AAMI Foundation, recognizes work over the last 20 years to collect and provide open access to “big data” and software tools through the creation of the PhysioNet Resource."

Her father composes pieces and her mother plays the piano. Her musical career started at the age of four when she began playing one of her sister’s cellos as well as began studying the piano and oboe. Her first televised concert with an orchestra was at the age of ten where she was a soloist (1981). One year after her televised solo, Gastinel entered the Lyons Conservatory School to begin her formal music education. At age 15 (1986), Gastinel finished first place in her class at the Musical Conservatory School in Lyon, France. After her time in Lyon she moved on to study at the more advanced National Musical Conservatory in Paris. In Paris her teachers included famous musicians and fellow cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma, Paul Tortelier, and János Starker; all of whom made their impression on her and her musical style. In 1990 Gastinel competed on the Eurovision Tournament in Vienna, where she represented France. She has participated in many more international contests since then and has done extremely well in several including the Cheveningen, Prague, and Rostropovich Competitions. Gastinel was the first French artist to reach the finals in the Prague International Competition in forty years and won first place in the International Competition of Scheveningen. By the young age of 18 (1989), this child prodigy had already performed in more than 50 cities all over Europe. Later on she began a worldwide solo career. She has traveled worldwide around many different continents such as Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas and has won many prizes for her work. She has played at many famous musical halls around the world during her years of touring. Some of the more notable venues are Santori Hall in Tokyo Japan, Victoria Hall in Geneva Switzerland, Berlin Konzerthaus in Germany, the Théâtre des Champs Elysées in Paris France, and Victoria Hall in London England. Gastinel has been awarded many prizes for her performances and albums. She was named “Victore of Music” in all three categories of competition; most inspirational, best track of the year, and soloist of the year. She is the only musician who has completed this feat. She also has received awards early on in her musical career such as “Most Promising Young Talent” in 1994 and Best Recording of the year in 1995 as well as the Prix-Fnac in 1995 and 2000. She was named “Woman of Gold” in 2002 for her work in the performing arts category. In 1997, Gastinel was named the Ambassador of French cello and thus was chosen to play Pablo Casal’s Goffriller cello (valued at 5 million francs) for one year by Pablo Casal’s wife, New Yorker Marta Casals-Istomin. Currently, she plays on a 1690 Testore cello given to her by the Fonds Instrumental Francais Association.She has recorded 14 albums since 1989 and many of them have been collaborations. She is mainly associated with the recording label Naive but she has also worked with the record labels Valois and Ottavo. Gastinel has worked with several pianists including Francois-Frederic Guy on several different albums and Claire Desert on her album Schubert: Arpeggione in 2006. She has also collaborated with a guitarist named Pablo Marquez on her Spanish influenced album, Iberica, in 2009. Gastinel mainly plays classical and baroque music and has played many pieces by famous musicians such as Haydn, Rachmaninov, Brahms, Strauss, Dvorak, Bach, Beethoven, and Debussy. Gastinel is still an active musician and has been invited to be a soloist at the Choeur Britten concert on the 15th of April this year (2014). Gastinel has played famous pieces in famous concert halls, she has played under the direction of several famous conductors, and she also has played with many other talented musicians including but not limited to German conductor Kurt Sanderling, French conductor Emmanuel Krivine, Russian conductor Semyon Bychkov, Israeli conductor Pinchas Steinberg, Russian violinist Yuri Bashmet, and English violinist Lord Yehudi Menuhin. Gastinel is now not only a musician but has also been a professor of cello in Lyon at the National Conservatory of Music and Dance since 2003. This is the same school she started her formal musical education at many years earlier. In an interview Gastinel described the essence of music as the joy of personal exchange and sharing passion. She remains unmarried and without children and still lives in Lyon."

Average Homeboy polarized viewers and critics, who were divided between praising the inherent entertainment value of a sincere, clean-cut teenager in 1980s attire attempting to rap, and denouncing the excesses of the era, absurdity of the rap, and ineptitude of its star, yet it garnered the attention of several prominent news & infotainment entities, including TIME and VH1, as well as men's culture magazine Complex, who, in a 2011 article, included it in its list of the 100 Best Viral Videos of the 2000s."

Sluysken was born in the Netherlands, and in 1765 became governor of the Dutch trading colony of Surat on the northwest coast of India. He was sent to the Cape in 1793. With his eye on defense in the case of a possible French attack, Sluysken commissioned the construction of a few small forts at Simon's Town in 1794. The following year, the citizens of Swellendam and Graaff-Reinet revolted and declared their independence from the Cape. At the same time British ships attack the Cape, and while Sluysken attempted to defend the colony against invasion, he had to surrender to the British forces on 14 September 1795. He returned to the Netherlands on 12 November. Verhaal gehouden bij den Commissaris van de Caap de Goede Hoop, his account of the events that took place between 10 June and 16 September, was published in 1797. Sluysken died on 18 January 1799."

  "text" : "Alice Piper (7 June 1908 – 22 August 1985) was a Paiute (Nuwuvi) girl residing in Big Pine, California who petitioned to attend the newly built Big Pine High School in 1923 and was denied entry due to her race. At that time, California educational law prohibited Native American children from attending a public school if a separate government run Indian school was established within three miles of the public school. Alice Piper along with six other Indian children sued the district for the right to attend. Piper sued on the grounds that her 14th Amendment rights had been violated knowing full well that she was not receiving the same education that the newly built public school afforded. The local Indian day school only offered education up to the 5th grade level, was underfunded, and lacked many basic resources. Furthermore, the District trustees had previously agreed to allow Indian students to attend the school if their parents voted for a measure that would fund the construction of the school. Although the measure passed, the board of trustees did not honor their agreement. As a local resident recalled, \"It was an exciting morning when the request was made, all the mothers and fathers of children of school age, Indian and white, were on the street to hear the answer of the district trustees. When the request was denied, the Indians immediately took court action pressing their case in the name of Alice Piper, a beautiful, intelligent, Indian girl.\"  The California Supreme Court unanimously ruled in her favor in the case Piper v. Big Pine (1924), thus opening the door for herself and other Native American children to attend public schools in the state of California."

He was best known as a staunch opponent of Civil Rights legislation; he was the author of numerous articles that criticized anti-discrimination legislation or sought to limit its scope. He was also the author of The Reconstruction Amendments' Debates: The Legislative History and Contemporary Debates in Congress on the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments (Virginia Commission on Constitutional Government, 1967), which was designed to show the limited scope of the Reconstruction Amendments to support federal anti-discrimination legislation. It has proven a useful resource for some scholars looking into the history of the Reconstruction Amendments. In the 1970s he was a co-founder of the Delaware Law School. He unsuccessfully sued Delaware Law School in the 1980s. In the 1980s a co-founder of the Northern Virginia Law School. That also resulted in unsuccessful litigation in federal court."

  "text" : "Andrew Cunningham Scott (born 16 February 1952) is a British geologist, and professor emeritus at Royal Holloway University of London. He won the 2007 Gilbert H. Cady Award from the Geological Society of America for outstanding contributions to coal geology. He is widely regarded an expert on wildfire and charcoal and has highlighted the role of fire in deep time. He also contributes as a palaeobotanist and science communicator. Scott was educated at Cannon Lane Primary School, (Pinner); St. Martins School, Northwood; Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood; and the University of London, where he obtained a B.Sc. (Bedford College) and a Ph.D. (Birkbeck College) studying under William Gilbert Chaloner. His thesis concerned the palaeoecology of Carboniferous Coal Measure plants. After a 2-year post-doctoral fellowship at Trinity College, Dublin, he returned to England to take up a lectureship in Geology at Chelsea College, University of London. During this period, his research concentrated on the Lower Carboniferous floras of Scotland including those from the Pettycur Volcanics and the East Kirkton Quarry. In 1985, the geology departments at Chelsea College and Bedford College merged to form a new department at Royal Holloway, University of London. He was awarded a personal chair in 1996, becoming Professor of Applied Palaeobotany. During the 1990s, he worked on Drawings and Prints in the Royal Library that had been collected by Cassiano dal Pozzo. These were part of a project undertaken by Federico Cesi and Francesco Stelluti, founders of the Accademia dei Linceii. His book on the drawing of fossil woods was launched by HRH Charles, Prince of Wales at Windsor Castle in 2005. From 1998 to 2006, he was the Director of Science Communication. He was awarded a D.Sc. from the University of London for his published research. In 2003, he was made an Honorary Professor at Jilin University, Changchun, China. He was a visiting Professor at Yale University in 2006–7 and a visiting fellow at Berkeley College. During this period, his research concentrated on the occurrence of wildfire in deep time. He also became involved with the Pyrogeography research group at the University of California, Santa Barbara and published several important papers and a book on Fire on Earth.In 2012 he became a distinguished research fellow and was awarded a Leverhulme Fellowship and became the Emeritus Professor of Geology in 2014. Scott has been involved in many radio broadcasts including In Our Time and was the subject of a BBC documentary about his research on coal for screenhouse productions and the Open University. He has been in writing articles on geology stamps and has had a long-term collaboration with the artist Nick Shrewing working on geological stamp designs for a number of countries including the Solomon Islands, Barbados, Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha. Scott is the recipient of several awards including the Presidents Award of the Geological Society of London and the Gilbert H. Cady Award from the Geological Society of America. He is also a Fellow of the Geological Society of London, Fellow of the Geological Society of America, Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and is a Chartered Geologist."

He is known for co-writing the films Noah and The Fountain with his Harvard Dunster House suitemate Darren Aronofsky and for helping to produce these films along with two other Darren Aronofsky films, The Wrestler and Black Swan. He started co-writing the film Noah around 2003. Handel grew up in a Jewish family in Newton, Massachusetts. He was born in Zürich, Switzerland, while his father was studying abroad, but he only lived there for about a year. Handel also did an internship for Nova at WGBH, the Boston PBS station. He has a PhD in neurobiology from New York University. Torn between science writing and science education, he eventually became a film writer in an attempt to become a better communicator of science, although he soon learned that filmmaking is largely an illusion."

  "text" : "Asa Ames (1823–1851) was an American sculptor from Erie County, New York. While most details concerning his life remain a mystery, recent research has established Ames as a significant figure in American folk art. Within his brief career from 1847 to his death in 1851, Ames created a series of three-dimensional portraits of family members, neighbors, and friends. His woodcarvings of children and young adults have garnered the most attention.Fourteen woodcarvings have been attributed to Ames. His works are currently at the following institutions: the American Folk Art Museum, the New York State Historical Association, the Huntington Art Museum, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, the Boulder History Museum, and the Wadsworth Atheneum."

Barr graduated from the Brantford Young Ladies’ College in 1883, receiving several awards, and went on to study art at Alma Ladies’ College in St. Thomas, Ontario. In 1893 she graduated, and also received mention for a still life she exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In 1895, Barr married George W. Brown and moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, where she was to spend the rest of her life. Her husband was a prominent homesteader, lawyer, businessman and politician, and as his wife she gained considerable influence. From 1910 to 1915 he served as Lieutenant Governor of the province. Barr was active in the local Methodist church and, through the church, became an active supporter of the Local Council of Women, serving as an executive in the organization. The council brought together a number of women's organizations in which Barr was active, including the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, the Young Women’s Christian Association, the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, the Women’s Musical Club, the Aberdeen Association, the Hospital Aid, the Women’s Educational Club, and the Kannata Club. She is not known to have been a vocal suffragist, but she was honorary president of the Provincial Equal Franchise Board in 1915 (Saskatchewan women achieved suffrage the next year). During the First World War she volunteered for the Red Cross and other war relief organizations. Barr and her husband had two children: Beatrice Annie, born 1897, and Gordon Barr, born 1901. She died in 1921, her husband having predeceased her by two years."

  "text" : "J. Alvin Christopher, is a politician who presently serves as leader of the People's Empowerment Party in the British Virgin Islands. He is not currently a member of the House of Assembly, but was the longstanding elected member for the second district, a position which he held from the 1995 general election until the 2015 general election. Alvin Christopher was first elected to office as an independent in 1995. Shortly afterwards he was offered the position of Minister of Communication and Works, and joined the governing Virgin Islands Party (VIP). After the 1999 general election he \"crossed the floor\" to join the opposition National Democratic Party (NDP). In May 2006 Mr Christopher was removed from his position as Minister of Communications and Works by the NDP, and at the next meeting of the legislative council he crossed the floor for a second time to sit once again with the opposition VIP (although not formally joining them as a party). This second move was believed to be related to differences of opinion in relation to the Telecommunications Bill 2006 and telecoms liberalisation programme in the British Virgin Islands generally, although all parties refused to confirm this at the time. Mr Christopher subsequently ran successfully as an independent in the 2007 general election, and was returned with a handsome majority. By the 2011 general election Mr Christopher had formally rejoined the VIP. In March 2014 Mr Christopher announced he was joining a newly formed political party, the People's Empowerment Party (or PEP) as Chairman which he would lead into the 2015 general election, and declared himself \"fit\" to be Premier. In the end the PEP was crushed in the 2015 general election, winning no seats, and Christopher lost his seat in the House. Christopher was philosophical about his defeat, and vowed not to quit politics."

His career did not reach the heights that was prophesied and has subsequently embarked upon a career in Corporate Tax, where he is doing rather well.

  "text" : "Aspietes (Greek: Ἀσπιέτης) was an Armenian nobleman who entered the service of the Byzantine Empire and served during much of the reign of Alexios I Komnenos (1081–1118). He was a member of the noble family of the Aspietai, which claimed descent from the Arsacid royal dynasty of Armenia. Aspietes is first attested alongside Alexios I during the 1081 campaign against the Normans that led to the disastrous Battle of Dyrrhachium, where Aspietes himself was gravely injured. The scene is graphically narrated by Alexios' daughter Anna Komnene in her Alexiad, highlighting Aspietes' valour. The name \"Aspietes\" appears in two different portions of the Alexiad, and it is not entirely clear whether it refers to the same or different people. Most scholars identify the Aspietes of Dyrrhachium with the Aspietes who in 1105/6 was appointed governor of Tarsus by the Emperor. Shortly after, he succeeded Monastras as stratopedarches of the East, in charge of the campaign against the Principality of Antioch. In this capacity he failed to react effectively to Tancred of Antioch, who proceeded to recapture Mopsuestia and several other fortresses that Monastras had taken the previous year. Instead, Aspietes occupied himself with debauched revelries. More recently, Alexis Savvides argued that the two personages are usually treated as distinct people, and interpreted—erroneously, according to Alexandra Wassiliou-Seibt—the relevant passage in the Alexiad as indicating that the first Aspietes died of his wounds at Dyrrhachium. Aspietes is not mentioned again after 1105/6. Nevertheless, beginning with the 17th-century scholar Du Cange, many historians, including Ferdinand Chalandon, Steven Runciman, and Alexis Savvides, have traditionally identified him with Oshin of Lampron (1073–1112), the lord of Cilician Armenia, who in turn is identified with the Ursinus of Western sources. It was only in 1924 that Joseph Laurent rejected this identification, and this view has been followed by several modern scholars since."

Ambrosio was a photographer who owned a shop in Turin. In 1904, after returning from a visit to Paris with a new film camera he began making short films of a documentary nature. In 1906 he founded Ambrosio Films and began making more ambitious fiction films. In 1908 Ambrosio produced and directed The Last Days of Pompeii, a major hit which helped trigger a fashion for Italian historical epics, generally set in the Classical era. Over the next decade Ambrosio oversaw a number of popular films and was able to export them to lucrative foreign markets such as Britain and America. Like other Italian filmmakers, Ambrosio struggled during the crisis that hit Italian filmmaking following the First World War and his career appeared to have been ended by the commercial failure of his 1924 epic Quo Vadis. However, he returned from retirement to head production at Scalera Films between 1939 and 1943."

  "text" : "Ambrosio Film was an Italian film production and distribution company which played a leading role in Italian cinema during the silent era. Established in Turin in 1906 by the pioneering filmmaker Arturo Ambrosio, assisted by cinematographers Giovanni Vitrotti and Roberto Omegna, the company initially produced large numbers of documentary and fictional short films, but its output quickly grew more ambitious. In 1908 the company made The Last Days of Pompeii (directed by Ambrosio and Luigi Maggi). The film was a major success, further enhancing the company's status and creating a fashion for Italian historical epics which other studios copied. In the wake of this, Ambrosio oversaw the production of a series of literary adaptations. The company built a large studio and picture house in Turin, and the city emerged as a major centre of the early Italian film industry. The company enjoyed success exporting its films to lucrative foreign markets such as Britain and America (Ambrosio opened an affiliate in New York). Ambrosio struck co-production deals with Russian and Germany companies. It remained a leading producer during the 1910s, but was hit by the slump that overcame the Italian film industry after the First World War. Arturo Ambrosio sold his share in the studio to a Milan businessmen Armando Zanotto. The company reduced its production programmes, and in 1924 was liquidated."

Their rickety boat's engine failed and the group drifted for five days, with the captain of the group overthrowing himself at one point in despair. The group were rescued by an oil tanker off the coast of Daytona Beach, Florida. He started his own business selling household items door to door in Cuba, eventually opening his own grocery store. He acquired enough money to buy land and property, and his family had electricity and TV, unusual in Cuba in 1957. Still, his adventurous side wanted to see what more, so he crossed the Florida Straits with nine others, settling first in Miami Beach. He flew his wife, Teresa, and two sons to Miami the next year and eventually bought his own store in Hialeah, Florida near a race track. Having done well, he opened a bigger store that catered to a more mixed clientele eventually leading to his own wholesale business in 1972 in the Jackson Memorial Hospital district, serving customers with roots in Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos. He sold the business in 2011, by which time he had already retired."

  "text" : "Alex Whitworth (born 22 April 1942 in Malta) is best known as an Australian sailor. Between 2005 and 2010 he sailed double handed twice around the world in Berrimilla II, a Brolga-class 33 ft sailing boat. The first circumnavigation was around Cape Horn from Sydney to England and back around Africa, during which he communicated with Astronaut Dr. Leroy Chiao, the commander of Expedition 10 on the International Space Station. The second, via the North West Passage, evolved from Whitworth’s contact with the Space Station and a later meeting with Dr. Pascal Lee who runs NASA’s Haughton Mars Camp on Devon Island. Dr. Lee invited Whitworth to rendezvous at the Camp for the total solar eclipse of 1 August 2008. Berrimilla started and finished the first circumnavigation with a Sydney – Hobart race and sailed double handed in the Fastnet Race on both. Whitworth posted daily logs on his website which were followed widely by people around the world and reposted or reported on other websites and in the press. Berrimilla’s co-skipper for the first circumnavigation and the return half of the second was Peter Crozier. Corrie McQueen sailed the Pacific leg of the second and was joined by Kimbra Lindus from Dutch Harbour to Falmouth. As far as it is possible to ascertain, amongst other achievements Berrimilla II was the first vessel ever to sail from Australia to England via the North West Passage and the first to circumnavigate via the North West Passage under sail. Whitworth received several awards for these voyages, including, in 2009, the Ocean Cruising Club Barton Cup and, in 2010, the Cruising Club of America’s Blue Water Medal for a circumnavigation of the world via the North West Passage West to East. When not at sea Whitworth teaches safety and sea survival to offshore sailors. During his professional career, he worked both in the Public Service and in private industry. He is a Fellow of the University of Wollongong. He has run about 30 marathons, including Stanley Marathon in the Falkland Islands during the first circumnavigation. His best time was 2hr 41min. in 1985."

  "text" : "Jean Arden Eversmeyer, widely known as “Arden” founded both Lesbians Over Age Fifty (LOAF) and the Old Lesbian Oral Herstory Project (OLOHP) and was a mayoral appointee to the Houston, Texas Agency on Aging. Her ongoing efforts ensure that older lesbians have access to community resources and that their unique life stories are recorded and celebrated. Eversmeyer realized and accepted her love for women while still a teenager. But, because it was a time when women suspected of being lesbians were routinely expelled from college and fired from their jobs, she led a very closeted life. She met her first partner, Tommie, early in her career and they were together 33 years. Born to Herbert and Audrey Eversmeyer in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, in 1931, Eversmeyer graduated from Texas State College for Women in 1951; she later completed graduate work at Sam Houston University. She worked in Texas public schools, primarily in Houston, as both an educator and counselor for over 30 years. After Tommie’s death in 1985, Eversmeyer began to volunteer openly for lesbian rights. She started Lesbians Over Age Fifty in 1987 to encourage a safe environment, meeting places, and a social network for mid-life and older lesbians. She also served on the steering committee of Old Lesbians Organizing for Change, a national network of women over 60 confronting ageism and improving the lives of lesbians everywhere. After being with her second partner, Charlotte, more than 25 years, the couple legally married in California. Today Eversmeyer is proud to live in a time when she can be her true self with acquaintances, friends, family, medical professionals, and everyone. In 1997 Eversmeyer, realizing that many of her friends were reaching the end of their lives, founded the Old Lesbian Oral Herstory Project to collect the life stories of lesbians age seventy and older to ensure their experiences were recognized and preserved. The project quickly grew by word of mouth and friends of friends to become more than a personal project. She began training others to extend the project's reach. Project volunteers have documented over 500 diverse life stories recording the sacrifices and obstacles faced by lesbians of that era. The collection is now archived, and continues to grow, as part of the prestigious Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College (see WorldCat record). OLOHP has published two books of collected interviews: A Gift of Old Age (2009; Purchase from OLOHP or borrow from a library (see WorldCat holdings); and Without Apology (2012; Purchase from OLOHP or borrow from a library (see WorldCat holdings). In August 2011, a room in the Montrose Counseling Center was dedicated to Eversmeyer, “whose achievements are too numerous to list.” During National Women's History Month, March 2014, Eversmeyer will be one of twelve honorees recognized for their contributions by the National Women’s History Project. The 2014 theme is “Women of Courage, Commitment, and Character.” “Every one of us has a story,” Eversmeyer says. “You don’t have to climb Mt. Everest to have a story. Every one of these stories is important and interesting.”"

Fleet (1936-1938). In October 1940 as a Lt. Commander he authored what is called the McCollum memo outlining his assessment of German and Japanese threats to U.S. security. From Nov. 1942 to May 1945, he held 3 titles simultaneously. He held Director of Allied Naval Intelligence, Southwest Pacific, Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Seventh Fleet, and Commanding Officer of the Seventh Fleet Intelligence Center.

She writes poetry and has worked as an information security specialist after graduating from Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. Never ever can we be brothers, written in Russian, has become her most widely cited poem. The poem was written in response to the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014. The poem celebrates the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and rejects \"Great Russia\": Freedom’s foreign to you, unattained;From your childhood, you’ve been chained.In your home, “silence is golden” prevails,But we’re raising up Molotov cocktails.In our hearts, blood is boiling, sizzling.And you’re kin? – you blind ones, miserly?There’s no fear in our eyes; it’s effortless,We are dangerous even weaponless. According to literary critics, the poem might have been influenced by Russian translation of the \"Britons never will be slaves!\" or by Marina Tsvetayeva. The YouTube video of Dmitruk reading her poem went viral, quickly accumulating more than a million hits. A song based on the poem was created by musicians from Klaipeda. It also quickly accumulated more than million hits. The poem was hotly debated in the press and received many thousand responses from Russian and Ukrainian audience It became a target of many parodies, especially by Russian readers who considered the poem \"Russophobic\" According to Yuri Loza, the \"elder Russian brothers\" in the poem appear as the reincarnation of Big Brother from Nineteen Eighty-Four It is one of the two most popular poems which were written in Ukraine immediately following the Euromaidan."

He studied engineering at the university of Aachen, and in 1903 was employed by the Dudelange office of works. A few months later he became Ingenieur adjoint at the foundry in Dudelange, in 1906 Chef de service and in 1912 director. In 1918, he was appointed to the headquarters of Arbed as technical director, becoming its director-general in 1920. In 1925 Aloyse Meyer became the head of the Chamber of Commerce, and in 1928 after the death of Émile Mayrisch, became president of the European steel union. Under the German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II, he remained as the director of ARBED. Just before US troops liberated Luxembourg in September 1944, Meyer was arrested by the Gestapo, acting on orders from Berlin, and taken to a prison in Wittlich in western Germany, along with his son Frank, and the head of the steel trading association Columeta, Michel Goedert. They were later released from prison, but remained in Germany under Gestapo surveillance until the war's end, and were unable to return to Luxembourg until April 1945. It later became known that he had directed large amounts of his own money towards the Belgian resistance and Belgian charities from 1942. After the war, he rejoined Arbed, the president of its executive board in April 1947. Aloyse Meyer was married to Eugénie Heintz, a descendant of the founder of the cigarette factory Heintz Van Landewyck. After the death of his father-in-law, Victor Heintz, Meyer in 1931 became president of the board of Heintz Van Landewyck, which he remained until his death. His son Robert Meyer, started his career in 1934 as an engineer at Heintz Van Landewyck."
