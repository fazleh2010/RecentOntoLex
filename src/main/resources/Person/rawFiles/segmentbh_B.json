  "text" : "David Broughton Knox (26 December 1916 – 14 January 1994) was principal of Moore Theological College from 1959 until 1985; and considered by some as the \"Father of Contemporary Sydney Anglicanism\". Knox was born in Adelaide and educated at Knox Grammar School and the University of Sydney. He was ordained deacon in 1941 and priest in 1942. After two years as a curate in Cambridge in England he was a RNVR chaplain during World War Two. He began his long association with Moore Theological College in 1947. Muriel Porter suggests that Knox's appointment as principal was \"one of the most important events for the shaping of the Sydney Diocese as it is today\", particularly in the way Knox's theology emphasised propositional revelation and his ecclesiology emphasised the local church."

He had a tough initiation to league football the following year, when as a 17-year-old on debut, he played as a full-back on Essendon's Paul Salmon. The Essendon player, who was 12 cm taller than his opponent, kicked four goals in the first quarter, prompting the coach to take Gloury off him. He kept his spot in the team for Collingwood's next game, against the Sydney Swans, which he played as a forward and kicked three behinds. In 1987 he made two appearances mid-year, against Fitzroy and North Melbourne, his last two league games. Gloury later played for Newbridge in the Loddon Valley Football League and with Kangaroo Flat in the Bendigo Football League. He was a member of Kangaroo Flat's 1996 premiership team."

  "text" : "William Buffalo Tiger (Heenehatche; March 6, 1920 – January 6, 2015 in Kendall, Florida) (Miccosukee) was a political leader of the tribal nation based in the Everglades area of Florida. He served as the first elected tribal chairman from 1962 to 1985, and before that was head of the General Council from 1957 and a chief. His activism led to political organization of the Miccosukee and their gaining federal recognition in 1962 as an independent Native American tribe. They wrote a constitution to govern their people. In 1959 Buffalo Tiger led a delegation to Cuba and secured formal diplomatic recognition from the government of Fidel Castro of the Miccosukee. In 1962 the US Government recognized the tribe. Under his leadership, the tribe in 1971 was the first to take over responsibility to operate its social and educational programs, as was later encouraged by the Indian Self-Determination Act of 1975. Buffalo Tiger and the tribe have used their sovereignty to preserve their culture and traditions in their homeland. With historian Harry A. Kersey, he wrote an autobiography, Buffalo Tiger: A Life in the Everglades (2008). Since the late 1980s, he has run an airboat tour company in the Florida Everglades."

He entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn in March 1839, and was called to the bar in May 1844. Bunny emigrated to Victoria in 1852, with the object of making a fortune on the goldfields; but by the advice of his friend, Vice-Chancellor Bacon, took his tools with him in the shape of a law library. After some experience on the Forest Creek diggings, he was admitted to the Victorian bar in October 1853, and commenced practice in Melbourne. Bunny represented St. Kilda in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from February 1866 to December 1867. Bunny acquired a good equity business, and was appointed a County Court Judge in 1873. In October of the next year, however, he exchanged this post for that of Commissioner of Titles, which he held till his death on 2 June 1885. Bunny was survived by his wife, three daughters and three sons."

  "text" : "Barry Besanko (born 15 August 1956) is a former Australian sprinter and Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Besanko was a junior nationals hurdles champion and competed in many athletics events before joining Essendon. In the Australian Track & Field Championships, his best performances included a second-place finish in the 100 metres in 1976-77 and four successive top three finishes in the 200m, finishing second in 1978-79. He was also a member of the Victorian team that won the 4 x 100 metres relay final in 1977-78, along with Fred Lehmann, Peter Van Miltenburg and Colin McQueen. Internationally, Besanko represented Oceania at the 1977 IAAF World Cup in West Germany and the 1979 IAAF World Cup in Canada. At both World Cups he was a finalist in the 4 x 100 metres relays, placing seventh each time. His best individual performance at a World Cup came in 1979, when he made the 200 metres final and finished eighth. During this time, Besanko also played Under 19s and reserves football for Melbourne. Not surprisingly given his speed, Besanko was a wingman. He made three appearances for Essendon, all in the 1980 VFL season. His elder brother Neil Besanko also played for the club. In 1983 he captain-coached Dingley but returned to Essendon the following year, to join their coaching staff. He was off again in 1986, to coach Rye, a position he held for two years. He then went to St Kilda, where he was a fitness adviser."

  "text" : "Betty Gram Swing, born Myrtle Eveline Gram, (March 16, 1893 – September 1, 1969), was an American militant suffragist. She participated in landmark events of the women's rights movement in the early to mid-twentieth century. She joined the women’s rights movement in 1917 and was subsequently jailed five times and went on two hunger strikes. When she was sent to Tennessee to push for the last vote needed to ratify the 19th amendment, a local newspaper announced, “110 Pounds of Femininity Hit Memphis”. Contemporary newspaper accounts often noted her attractiveness. She remained active for many decades in women’s rights and other causes. In 1921, Gram married well-known radio commentator Raymond Gram Swing. She insisted that he take her last name as well if she was taking his and became Betty Gram Swing. The couple were the parents of two sons and a daughter. They divorced in 1944."

He attended correspondence and state schools and then Church of England Grammar School in East Brisbane. He served in the Royal Australian Air Force from 1943 to 1945 and on his return became a grazier. On 18 August 1949, he married Shirley Margaret Lockhart, with whom he had four children. A member of the Country Party, he was elected to Winton Shire Council in 1955, serving until 1957. In 1974 he was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly as the member for Gregory. He joined the front bench in 1980 as Minister for Lands and Forestry. He served throughout the 1980s but in 1989 lost the position after Russell Cooper became Premier, since Glasson was a loyal supporter of Mike Ahern. As a result, he resigned from Parliament on 30 November 1989, two days before the state election. Glasson died in Brisbane in 2012 and was buried in Lutwyche Cemetery. One of Glasson's sons, Bill Glasson, was President of the Australian Medical Association from 2003 to 2005."

  "text" : "Beata Oxenstierna (1591 in Reval Castle – 16 March 1652), was a Swedish noblewoman and courtier. She served as överhovmästarinna to queen Christina of Sweden from 1639 to 1647. Beata Oxenstierna was born to Baron Erik Gabrielsson Oxenstierna (1540s-1594) and Bengta Gera. Her father had been a courtier to Princess Cecilia Vasa of Sweden, and governor in Swedish Livonia, and she was born in Reval in Livonia during his tenure as governor there. She served as maid of honor to the queen of Sweden, Christina of Holstein-Gottorp, in 1610-1613. In 1613, she married Erik Göransson Ulfsparre af Broxvik (1577-1631), but as was the custom at the Swedish nobility up until the late 18th century, she kept her name even after her marriage. Her spouse served as governor in Stegeborg 1615-18, Norrköping 1618-21, Kronoberg 1621-26, and Östergötland 1627-1631; Beata Oxenstierna was widowed in 1631. On 2 February 1639, she was appointed mistress of the robes to queen Christina. After the tragic death of the queen's foster mother and aunt, Catherine of Sweden, Countess Palatine of Kleeburg in 1638, the council judiciously decided that the queen should have not one, but two foster mothers, as well as two mistress of the robes. The reason for splitting these two positions in four, was the wish that Christina should not be dependent upon one single individual and favorite. In 1639, the position of Mistress of the Robes was thereby shared between Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning (though the former was given a higher rank), and the position of foster mother was shared by Ebba Mauritzdotter Leijonhufvud and Christina Natt och Dag. Formally, however, also Leijonhufvud and Natt och Dag was given the title of Mistress of the Robes in name, though not in regard to their task. Leijonhufvud was related to Councillor Oxenstierna by marriage, which is believed to have played a part in why she was given her position: Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning was also connected to the Oxenstierna party. Beata Oxenstierna is described thusly: \"A charitable lady, who did much good at court\". With some exceptions, such as Ebba Sparre, lady Jane Ruthven and Louise van der Nooth, Christina did not show any interest in her female courtiers, and generally mentions them only to express contempt over their femininity and portray herself as more masculine than them. In 1639 she mentions her attitude toward her ladies in waiting in regard to Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter, maid of honor Märta Ulfsparre: \"The Mistress of the Robes Lady Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter arrived just now. The more of them that comes here the worse it is\". She was granted two estates in 1646 and retired with a very large pension on 6 July 1647."

  "text" : "William Bradley \"Bill\" Hunter (November 2, 1928 - April 23, 1964) was an American crime reporter for the Long Beach, California Independent Press-Telegram. Hunter's 16-page special on the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby, \"Three Days in Dallas\", was awarded the 1964 \"spot news reporting\" award of the California Newspaper Publishers Association's \"Better Newspaper Contest\". A native of Wichita Falls, Texas, Hunter had previously worked as a court reporter there for five years before becoming a crime reporter. On March 22, 1964, Hunter wrote a story for the Press-Telegram saying that Oswald had \"assuredly\" killed Kennedy. On April 23, 1964, Hunter was killed in a Long Beach police station by a police officer, Creighton Wiggins. Wiggins initially claimed that the shot was fired when he dropped his weapon; when the trajectory of the bullet showed this was impossible, Wiggins admitted he had been playing \"quick draw\" with a fellow officer, Errol Greenleaf, and had fired accidentally. Wiggins and Greenleaf, who said his back was turned at the time, were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and received three-year probation sentences. In 1991, a fellow Press-Telegram columnist said in that he had often experienced gun-play in his friendships with Long Beach policemen declaring, \"It was childish and terribly dangerous fun, and finally fatal. The only surprise is that it hadn’t happened before.\" Hunter's death nonetheless remains one of many considered suspicious by some researchers pursuing John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories."

In 1926 she was named by the Associated Motion Picture Advertisers as one of the 12 women who had accomplished the most for the motion picture industry; the other 11 women were all actresses or screenwriters. Beulah Livingstone Frank, daughter of Harry and Lucy Frank, graduated from the Ethical Culture School in 1905. After teaching kindergarten for three years, she began newspaper and magazine work, writing stories, articles and interviews. Using the name Beulah Livingstone, she transitioned into theatrical publicity, doing publicity work for Lou Tellegen, Anna Pavlova, Irene Castle, David Belasco and other theatrical stars and producers. In 1916 she handled New York publicity for Thomas Ince's motion picture Civilization. In 1916-1917 she wrote a column for Billboard under various headings including \"Broadway in Brief,\" \"Times Square Tattle\" and \"Gossip of the Fair Sex.\" In 1917 she became publicity agent for Olga Petrova and created a notable publicity campaign. In 1919 she was hired by Joseph Schenck to direct publicity for Norma Talmadge, and her success prompted Schenck to later expand her duties to include publicity for Constance Talmadge, Buster Keaton, Rudolph Valentino, and others. In 1925 she accompanied Valentino to a New York theater and they had great difficulty leaving due to the large mob of fans. In 1938 she wrote the small book Remember Valentino: Reminiscences of the World's Greatest Lover. She was vice president of the Lucy Stone League, honorary president of \"The Woman Pays\" Club of New York, vice president of the Theatrical Press Representatives of America, and member of the New York Newspaper Women's Club. Beulah Livingstone died in New York, NY, on 12 January 1975. Her sister, Mabel Livingstone, also worked as a publicist during the silent film era."

  "text" : "William Hawkes (3 September 1941–?), known professionally as Billy Hawks (without the 'e'), was an American R&B and jazz organist. He was born in Richmond, Virginia, and grew up singing, playing piano, and listening to the blues. In 1961 he joined Steve Gibson's Red Caps, and the following year joined the Modern Flamingos. Under the guidance of manager Clifford Doubledee, he formed his own group, the Billy Hawks Organ Trio, in Philadelphia in 1964, with guitarist Maynard Parker and drummer Henry Terrell. The group performed along the East Coast, notably at Atlantic City. He recorded his first album, The New Genius of the Blues, for Prestige Records in November 1966, with Terrell, and with guitarist Boogaloo Joe Jones replacing Parker. The album was produced by Cal Lampley. Released in 1967, it was followed by Heavy Soul! (sometimes known as More Heavy Soul!), on which he, Parker and Terrell were joined on some tracks by tenor sax player Buddy Terry. The album was recorded at Rudy Van Gelder's studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, in December 1967. In 1968, the track \"O Baby (I Do Believe I'm Losing You)\" was released as a single in France on Stateside (FSS 604) and in 1988 the same track appeared on a BGP Records compilation LP \"Dance Juice Vol.2\" (BGP 1016) and subsequently, the tune became well-played on the Acid Jazz scene in the UK. Hawks seems not to have recorded subsequently. According to his younger brother Leroy Hawkes, who performs with a blues and soul band the Hipnotics, Billy Hawks is deceased. The New Genius Of The Blues and Heavy Soul! were combined and reissued on a single CD by BGP Records in 1998. \"O Baby (I Do Believe I'm Losing You)\" was sampled by Us3 on their 2002 track \"Get Out\"."

He grew up in North London before moving to France for a period of time. At one point a homeless teenager in Paris, his performances helped him to become a cult figure in the music and art scene. Following his move back to London, he made his TV debut on the BBC programme Later With Jools Holland in 2013. Dubbed as becoming one of the greatest singer-songwriters of his generation, most critics have honoured him citing and describing him as a man of unusual intelligence, great piano style and deep musicality with charisma on stage but nonetheless, found it difficult to place his music in one specific genre, mostly stating that its rather beyond category. However, his vocal range, ability and diction has mostly been compared to that of Leonard Cohen, Nina Simone, and his passionate vocal delivery to Edith Piaf. Clementine's compositions are musically incisive and attuned to the issues of life but also poetic mixing revolt with love and melancholy, sophisticated lyricism with slang and shouts, and rhyming verse with prose monologues. He moved from busking to music-halls, to symphonic music and spoken word, breaking free from traditional song structure, inventing his own dramatic and innovative musical territory. He is noticeably seen playing on stage entirely in black or dark grey long trench-like woollen coat with no shirt underneath, in bare feet. Despite failing to chart in the UK, his debut album At Least For Now won the 2015 Mercury Prize and fared better across mainland Europe. At the end of 2015 Clementine was included in The Guardian's New Year's honours a list to celebrate heroes of 2015Debrett's and Britain's London Evening Standard named him one of the most influential people in Britain."

  "text" : "Bridget Holmes (1591–1691) was a domestic servant at the English royal court in the 17th century. Holmes was a \"necessary woman\" whose duties included emptying and scouring chamber pots and cleaning the royal apartments. She served during the reigns of Charles I, Charles II, James II, and William III and Mary II. She is best known as the subject of a full-length slightly over life-size portrait dated 1686 in the Royal Collection by John Riley, painted on a scale and \"in a style...normally reserved for royalty\" or the nobility. Though signed by Riley, the painting may owe much to the contribution of John Closterman, who often worked with Riley, because of its \"impressive\" composition. It is not clear why James II commissioned the portrait, which was an extravagant way to \"celebrate her great age and her loyalty to the Stuarts\", and also seems to make a \"satirical or moral comment\" on the conventions of grand portraiture, as \"a parody of all those martial portraits of dukes and generals. But the figure herself is treated with great dignity, very respectfully. The joke's not on her\" as one curator put it. Critic Ronald Jones noted that \"[Holmes] is resonant with self-respect, and can play with her venerable position in the household; teasingly she brandishes her mop after a page-boy\", a Page of the Backstairs according to the Royal Collection. Riley painted two other, smaller, portraits of servants: Katherine Elliot (also Royal Collection) and A Scullion in the Christ Church Picture Gallery, Oxford. Other portraits by the Netherlandish painter Pieter Aertsen from the previous century show female cooks holding roasting spits like marshall's batons in what have been taken to be clear references to the conventions of elite portraiture, though whether these would have been known to James (who had spent his youth in exile in the Low Countries) or Riley is unknown. Bridget Holmes died in 1691 at the age of 100 and was buried in Westminster Abbey with a monument noting the monarchs whom she had served. She is believed to have been \"one of the longest serving servants in royal history\". The painting of Bridget Holmes is among the \"few pre-eighteenth-century portraits of working-class people\" in existence. It is normally on display in the state apartments of Windsor Castle. It was included in the \"Below Stairs\" exhibition of servant portraits at the National Portrait Gallery, London in 2003, and has also been shown in other exhibitions of the Royal Collection."

  "text" : "William Louis \"Bill\" Stricker (born January 22, 1948) is a retired American professional basketball player who spent one season in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played in just two minutes of one game with the inaugural 1970–71 Portland Trail Blazers season. Despite his lack of play, Blazers fan took a liking to Stricker and chanted \"We want Stricker, We want Stricker\" in blowout games. He was allowed to play in a game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, a day before being placed on waivers. He was drafted from the University of the Pacific by the Baltimore Bullets during the third round (54th pick overall) of the 1970 NBA Draft, but he did not sign. After his basketball career was over, Stricker had a long and successful career as a high school coach and administrator at East Union High School in Manteca, California. He coached future NBA player and coach Scott Brooks."

He began his academic career in 1971 at the University Institutes of Technology of the University of Lorraine as an assistant and then as a lecturer in economics. His economics PhD thesis relates to the building up of the French social security system between 1920 and 1980. He challenges the interpretation that makes the 1945 Social Security a necessary element of the Fordist era of capitalism. He insists instead on the \"anti-capitalist nature of the institutions of socialization of wages\". He leads the European Institute of Wages and a popular education association called Réseau Salariat, which promotes the idea of an \"unconditional lifelong salary\" (Salaire à vie inconditionnel) as an alternative proposal to the basic income - an idea denounced by Friot as \"the spare wheel of capitalism\". His research focuses on the sociology of wages and comparing social protection systems in Europe. His work has also focused on pensions, going against the French government's proposed reforms in 2010.The living wage supported by Bernard Friot is, according to his analyse, the best subversive answer to the 4 main institutions of capitalism : lucrative property (not private property, only private property where profit is taken from), credit (a state does not need to borrow to finance investment), employment market (the central base of capitalism causing the blackmail to unemployment), the assessing of economic value according to the duration of working.To be fully understood, Bernard Friot developed trough Reseau-salariat lots of tutoring videos. His goal is to show the \"dejà-là\", meaning the actual waging by socialized value in the French economic system via the social security, the public employment, etc."

  "text" : "Bjarni Bjarnason (1761-1805), was one of the most well known murderers in the history of Iceland alongside Steinunn Sveinsdóttir. In 1802, Bjarni Bjarnason and Steinunn Sveinsdóttir mutually murdered their respective spouses in Sjöundá in Iceland. The case became famous as the Morðin á Sjöundá (The Sjöundá Murders). They were both arrested, subjected to torture and sentenced to death. However, it was no longer legal to perform executions on Iceland at that time, so they were to be brought to Norway for their execution. Steinunn died in prison before she could be taken to Norway, but Bjarni was shipped to Norway, where he was executed in 1805. The case has been the subject of two plays and a novel by Gunnar Gunnarsson, Svartfugl (1938)."

  "text" : "Dov Ber Borochov (Russian: Дов-Бер Борохов; July 3, 1881 – December 17, 1917) was a Marxist Zionist and one of the founders of the Labor Zionist movement as well as a pioneer in the study of Yiddish as a language. He was born in the town of Zolotonosha, Russian Empire (currently in Ukraine). As an adult he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party but was expelled when he formed a Zionist Socialist Workers Union in Yekaterinoslav. Subsequently, he helped form the Poale Zion party and devoted his life to promoting the party in Russia, Europe, and America. When the Russian social democrats came to power, Borochov returned to Russia in March 1917 to lead the Poale Zion. He became ill and died in Kiev of pneumonia in December 1917. Borochov became highly influential in the Zionist movement because he explained nationalism in general, and Jewish Nationalism in particular in terms of Marxist class struggle and dialectical materialism. Borochov predicted, correctly, that nationalist forces would be more important in determining events than economic and class considerations, especially as concerned the Jews. Borochov argued that the class structure of European Jews resembled an inverted class pyramid where few Jews occupied the productive layers of society as workers. The Jews would migrate from country to country as they were forced out of their chosen professions by a \"stychic process\" which would ultimately force migration to Palestine, where they would form a proletarian basis in order to carry out Marxist class struggle. A key part of Borochovian ideology was that the Arab and Jewish working classes had a common proletarian interest and would participate in the class struggle together once Jews had returned to Palestine. In his last recorded speech, he said: Many point out the obstacles which we encounter in our colonization work. Some say that the Turkish law hinders our work, others contend that Palestine is insignificantly small, and still others charge us with the odious crime of wishing to oppress and expel the Arabs from Palestine...When the waste lands are prepared for colonization, when modern technique is introduced, and when the other obstacles are removed, there will be sufficient land to accommodate both the Jews and the Arabs. Normal relations between the Jews and Arabs will and must prevail. Borochov, along with Nachman Syrkin is considered a father of socialist Zionism. Borochov's ideas were influential in convincing Jewish youth from Europe to move to Palestine. However, Borochov's theories remained most influential in Eastern Europe, where they formed the basis of the Left Poale Zionist movement which was active in Poland during the interwar years. Indeed, Borochov's vision of class struggle in Palestine was widely viewed as untenable by the 1910s, with Jewish migrants to Palestine struggling to establish an economic foothold and with interclass cooperation seemingly necessary, and his theories dimmed in popularity there. Borochov, for years an advocate for a doctrinaire Marxist Zionism, himself seemed to repudiate his former vision of class struggle in Palestine in speeches towards the end of his life. Borochov insisted that he was a Social Democrat, but Borochov's Left Poale Zion followers continued to vigorously advocate class struggle both in Palestine and eastern Europe, supporting the February Revolution of 1917. Borochov returned to Russia in August 1917 attended the Third All-Russian Poalei Tziyon Party congress to argue for socialist settlement in Palestine, The Poalei Tziyon conference selected Borochov as a delegate the Conference of Nationalities where he issued a paper calling for Russia as a decentralized socialist commonwealth of nations (“Rossiia kak sodruzhestvo narodov”). Borochov caught pneumonia while on a speaking tour and died in Kiev on December 17, 1917 at the age of 36. The Russian Poale Zion movement split into two factions over attitudes towards the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. The Poale Zion Left formed a \"Borochov Brigade\" to join the Red Army during the Russian Civil War and ultimately split from the main Poale Zion party to become the Jewish Communist Party (Poalei Zion) in 1919 and would go on to join the Jewish section (Yevsektsiya) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union while the social democratic Right Poale Zion was banned. The international Poale Zion movement also split into left and right factions, which have evolved into the modern Israeli political parties of Mapam (later Meretz) and the Israeli Labor Party respectively. The European branch of the Left Poale Zion movement was effectively destroyed by the early 1950s; many of its members were killed by the Nazis during World War II, and the surviving activists were persecuted and ultimately outlawed under the various post-war Communist regimes. While most Zionists regarded Yiddish as a derivative language characteristic of the Jewish Diaspora and to be abandoned by the Jewish people in favor of Hebrew, Borochov was a committed Yiddishist and Yiddish philologist and wrote extensively on the importance of the language. He is considered the founder of modern Yiddish studies. Borochov’s contributions were recognized in various ways by the early Jewish settlement in Palestine. For example, the first workers' neighborhood in the country, in what later became the city of Giv'atayim, was named after Borochov."

  "text" : "Brent Hodge (born July 9, 1985) is a Canadian-New Zealander documentary filmmaker and entrepreneur. He is best known for his documentaries I Am Chris Farley, A Brony Tale and The Pistol Shrimps. He has been nominated for six Leo Awards for his documentary movies Winning America, What Happens Next? and A Brony Tale, winning one for A Brony Tale in 2015,. He was nominated for two Shorty Awards under the \"director\" category in 2014 and 2015 for his work on The Beetle Roadtrip Sessions and A Brony Tale. Hodge also won a Canadian Screen Award in 2014 for directing The Beetle Roadtrip Sessions with Grant Lawrence. Hodge's documentary, The Pistol Shrimps (2016), follows a LA-based female basketball team, The Pistol Shrimps—including actress Aubrey Plaza and founder Maria Blasucci (Drunk History)—who come together for weekly matches filled with trash-talking, hard-fouling, wisecracking action. The documentary was co-produced with Warrior Poets and Morgan Spurlock as Executive Producer. The documentary won a Founders Award at Michael Moore's Traverse City Film Festival in July 2016. The Pistol Shrimps is distributed by NBC's subscription streaming service, Seeso and available online. Hodge directed I Am Chris Farley in 2015 with Derik Murray of Network Entertainment. The documentary is based on the life of comedian actor Chris Farley and features interviews with numerous actors, comedians and others who worked with Farley during his career. The film was long listed for an Academy Award. In 2014, Hodge released his critically acclaimed documentary A Brony Tale. It delves into the world of the teenage and adult fans of the television show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (called bronies) through the eyes of musician and voice actress Ashleigh Ball on her trip to the 2012 BronyCon. He has also done corporate work for Time Magazine, CBC Music, Tourism Alberta, National Film Board of Canada (for the movie Hue: A Matter of Colour), as well as technology startups Uber, Hootsuite and Steve Russell's analytics startup Prism Skylabs. Hodgee Films partnered with Morgan Spurlock in 2014 when Spurlock picked up their A Brony Tale documentary for theatrical distribution, under his \"Morgan Spurlock Presents\" label, a partnership between Warrior Poets, Virgil Films and Abramorama. A Brony Tale was the first film released under this label. The company worked with Spurlock again on the web series Consider the Source, also partnering with Disney's Maker Studios."

  "text" : "Bertha of Milan or Bertha of Luni (c. 997-c. 1040), was a member of the Obertenghi dynasty. Bertha was married to Ulric Manfred II of Turin. She is sometimes identified with the Bertha who was married to Arduin of Ivrea. Although it is known that Bertha was a member of the Otbertenghi dynasty, there is some debate about who her parents were. Her father is often said to be Oberto II, but others argue that Bertha’s father was in fact Otbert III of Milan. By 1014 at the latest, Bertha had married Ulric Manfred (that year, Emperor Henry II confirmed their joint donation to the abbey of Fruttuaria). Her dowry included lands in the counties of Tortona, Parma and Piacenza. In May 1028 with her husband, Ulric Manfred, Bertha founded the convent of Santa Maria at Caramagna. The following year, in July 1029, along with her husband and his brother, Bishop Alric of Asti, Bertha founded the Benedictine abbey in of S. Giusto in Susa, which housed the relics of Saint Justus of Novalesa. The church of the Abbey of San Giusto is now Susa Cathedral. After Ulric Manfred’s death (in December 1033 or 1034), Bertha briefly acted as regent for their daughter, Adelaide of Susa. In 1037 Bertha captured envoys who wished to cross the Alps from Piedmont to Champagne, thus foiling a conspiracy against Emperor Conrad II. Conrad II rewarded Bertha for her part in suppressing the rebellion against him by issuing an imperial diploma which confirmed her donations to the abbey of S. Giusto in Susa.

  "text" : "Barbara Alex Toy FRGS (11 August 1908 – 18 July 2001) was an Australian-British travel writer, theatrical director, playwright, and screenplay writer. She is most famous for the series of books she wrote about her pioneering and solitary travels around the world in a Land Rover, undertaken in the 1950s and 1960s. Toy was drawn to deserts, and so the majority of her journeys were in the arid lands of Northern Africa and the Middle East. Toy's first solo journey took place almost five years before the perhaps more celebrated six-man team Oxford and Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition, a London to Singapore overland trip between September 1955 and March 1956 that was also undertaken in Land Rovers."

  "text" : "Brent W. Brisben (born March 20, ?) is an American treasure hunter best known for salvaging the shipwrecks of the historic 1715 Treasure Fleet, a Spanish treasure fleet returning from the New World to Spain. During the early morning hours of July 31, 1715, seven days after departing from Havana, Cuba, eleven of the twelve ships of this fleet were lost in a hurricane near present-day Vero Beach, Florida. Because the fleet was carrying silver, it is also known as the 1715 Plate Fleet (plata being the Spanish word for silver plate). Some artifacts and even coins still wash up on Florida beaches from time to time. Brisben and his father William O. Brisben founded 1715 Fleet - Queens Jewels, LLC in 2010. The Brisbens purchased the exclusive salvage rights to the 1715 Treasure Fleet from the heirs of world famous treasure hunter Mel Fisher. Just 17 days after the purchase, a subcontractor to 1715 - QJ recovered the only bronze swivel gun ever found on the 1715 Fleet. Hidden inside the bronze cannon were 51 gold escudos and 40 silver reales. Within a month of the cannon find, a mother/daughter team of subcontractors of Brisben's company recovered the \"Pelican in Piety\". The find was valued at $885,000. In July 2013, Brisben and his crew aboard the M/V Capitana made headlines with the recovery of 51 gold escudos valued at $300,000. Days later on Sept 1, 2013 a family of subcontractors recovered 50 feet of gold chain and 5 gold escudos valued at over $350,000. On July 28, 2015, Brisben announced that the same family of subcontractors had found over 50 gold coins worth approximately 1 Million Dollars. The centerpiece of the find was an extremely rare coin called a Royal dated 1715.The Royal coin was a perfect specimen of Spanish coinage made specifically for King Phillip V. \n* 1715 Royal Eight Escudo On July 30 and 31 of 2015, Brisben and his crew aboard the M/V Capitana made one of the most significant finds in 1715 Fleet History. On the actual 300th Anniversary of the sinking of the 1715 Fleet, they recovered 300 gold coins including 7 Royals. Over the next week of salvage they added 50 more coins including 2 Royals. The story of the recovery of 350 Spanish Escudos and 9 Royals worth 4.5 Million Dollars made headlines worldwide. CBS THIS MORNING broke the story live on August 19, 2015."

  "text" : "Brenda Lewis (born 2 March 1921, Harrisburg) is an American operatic soprano, musical theatre actress, opera director, and music educator. She enjoyed a 20-year-long collaboration with the New York City Opera (NYCO) with whom she notably created roles in several world premieres by American composers; including the title role in Jack Beeson's Lizzie Borden in 1965. She also performed with frequency at the Metropolitan Opera from 1952-1965, and was active as a guest artist with notable opera companies both nationally and internationally. Although she is mainly remembered as an exponent of American operas and musicals, she performed a broad repertoire of works and was particularly celebrated for her portrayals of Marie in Wozzeck, Rosalinde in Die Fledermaus, and the title roles of Carmen and Salome; the latter of which she performed for the inauguration of Houston Grand Opera in 1956. Lewis was also a familiar face to Broadway audiences in operettas, operas, and musicals; appearing in eight productions between 1944 and 1964. Her most successful appearance on Broadway was in the role of Birdie Hubbard in the world premiere of Marc Blitzstein's Regina in 1949. She later became closely associated with the title role in that work which she performed and recorded on disc with the NYCO in 1958. After retiring from the stage, she worked as a voice teacher and opera director at the Hartt School of Music. She also directed and produced operas for the New Haven Opera Theater from 1963-1973"

  "text" : "Bartolo Mascarello (1927 – March 12, 2005) was an Italian winemaker most known for producing Barolo wine. Bartolo joined the family firm, Cantina Mascarello, in 1945 and learned winemaking from his father, Giulio, who in turn had been trained by his father, Bartolomeo. Mascarello spent most of his life tending four small vineyards in prime locations: Cannubi, San Lorenzo and Rué in Barolo, and Rocche in La Morra. He favoured the old-school practice of blending from those four plots, instead of single-vineyard bottlings.A teenage partisan during WWII, he was dubbed, together with fellow producers Teobaldo Cappellano and Giuseppe Rinaldi, ‘the Last of the Mohicans’ for his dogged refusal to let traditions die. For years, Mascarello's unyielding stance branded him as a has-been among some of his peers and Italian wine critics. In the late 1980s and early 1990s international and Italian critics launched an assault on traditional Barolos in favor of dark wines with coffee and vanilla sensations derived from aging in new barriques. Mascarello became the denomination’s guardian of traditional Barolo, as he clung tenaciously to the methods taught to him by his forebears. The producer – who deplored the shift from large Slavonian casks to small French oak barriques – even created a special hand-painted \"No Barrique, No Berlusconi\" label. He explained: \"No Barrique, because I am against the use of barriques in Barolo – I am a traditional producer. No Berlusconi because I don't like his type of politics.\"  The original hand-painted labels are now a much sought-after collectors’ item.Mascarello, who had a loyal core of customers from around the world throughout his career, also started to receive critical acclaim. The Italian wine world was shocked and thrilled when his wine received recognition in 2002 by the leading Italian wine guide, reversing years of criticism. Ironic and witty, he declared shortly before his death: \"As the time came to change oak casks I made sure that every corner of the cellar was filled, so that when I die there would be no room for barriques\". After his death his daughter Maria Teresa took over running of the winery, following her father’s traditional methods. She eschews marketing or promotion and does not have a website."

  "text" : "Esther Jones, known by her stage name \"Baby Esther\", was a black singer and entertainer of the late 1920s, known for her \"baby\" singing style. She performed regularly at the Cotton Club in Harlem. Theatrical manager Lou Walton testified during the Fleischer v. Kane trial that Helen Kane saw Baby Esther's cabaret act in 1928 with him and appropriated Jones' style of singing, changing the interpolated words \"boo-boo-boo\" and \"doo-doo-doo\" to \"boop-boop-a-doop\" in a recording of \"I Wanna Be Loved By You\". Kane never publicly admitted this. Jones' style, as imitated by Kane, went on to become the inspiration for the voice of the cartoon character Betty Boop. When Kane attempted to sue Fleischer Studios for using her persona, the studios defended themselves by arguing that Kane herself had taken it from \"Baby Esther\" Jones. An early test sound film of Baby Esther's performance was used as evidence. In court, it was presumed that Jones had since died."

He made his way to Rome, where he became a monk for 18 years, during which he became famous for his piety. He went back to Constantinople to escape his growing reputation of holiness and was welcomed in the Stoudios Monastery, and he later moved to Athos. He died in 908 on a visit to Constantinople."

  "text" : "Ben Sures (born December 29, 1967) is a Canadian roots musician and contributor to CBC Radio's The Irrelevant Show. He is the son of Order of Canada-winning ceramic artist Jack Sures and painter and illustrator Deborah Uman-Sures. A mostly-self-taught musician, Sures discovered the music of Robert Johnson at age 15 and devoted himself to the study of blues and roots. He spent close to a decade as an itinerant street musician and more than 20 years touring the Canadian coffee house and festival circuit both as a solo headliner and as a sideman for blues musicians such as Harp Dog Brown, Rita Chiarelli and Paul Reddick. During that time, he developed a distinctive, quirky songwriting style marked by plain-spoken lyrics that often express unique takes on unusual topics. He won the folk category of the 2005 John Lennon Song Competition with \"Any Precious Girl, a compassionate-yet-unpatronizing song about a young woman with bipolar disorder. His most recent folk album, Gone to Bolivia made Now’s Best of the Year lists in 2011, and contained the song \"Columbus Sailed Here\", in which Sures observes the transformation of third-world countries due to cruise ship tourism. Other notable examples of Sures’ style are found on \"High School Steps\", on which he performs a tribute to Ray Davies of the Kinks by reflecting on the life of high school musicians who saw Davies as their idol. Sures is the resident musician on CBC Radio’s The Irrelevant Show. His side projects include The Death Ballad Love Tellers, a song circle with fellow underground folk singers David P. Smith and Buba Uno, in which the performers challenge themselves to write murder ballads and perform them on stage. His latest solo album, Son of Trouble, is his first blues-influenced album."

  "text" : "María Yáñez García (stage name, Bella Dorita; Cuevas de Almanzora, Province of Almería, February 23, 1901 - Barcelona, June 27, 2001), was a Spanish cabaret singer, dancer, and vedette. In 1913, she emigrated to Barcelona with her family (mother, grandfather, uncle and six siblings) due to the economic hardship caused by the closure of the lead and silver mines in her locale. In Barcelona, she worked in a toy factory and embroidery shop. At the age of sixteen, she eloped with her first husband. After a working as a hostess, she appeared in 1917 at a beauty pageant which started her on a career in show business, debuting in 1923. As a cupletista, she appeared in halls and theaters, such as Pompeya, Rigat, Novelty, Bataclán, Cómico, Español, Arnau, Victoria, Nuevo, and Apolo where she began to establish his career. In those years, she took singing lessons and voice as well as learning how to perform on the Catalan stage. At the El Molino, she took on her stage name of Bella Dorita and become a star. It would make famous songs such as La pulga, El tren, La vaselina, Poco a poco and Fumando espero. During the 1940s and 1950s, Bella Dorita enjoyed the greatest success, being considered the most important star of the Avinguda del Paral·lel and compared often with Mae West for her brilliant dialogue, direct but not vulgar. In addition to regularly performing in Spanish venues in Madrid, Valencia, Bilbao, and Zaragoza, she also traveled to Paris and visited Montmartre, but always preferred performing at Paral·lel. She retired during the 1960s at the Teatro Victoria with the show Historias del Paralelo. She spent the last years of her life in the Nursing Home Pilar de Barcelona. In 1991, coinciding with her 90th birthday, she received the Medal for Artistic Merit of the City of Barcelona, and on the occasion of her 100th birthday in 2001, she received a tribute in the Barcelona neighborhood of Gava. She died four months later."

His hybrid works are greatly influenced by the abstract expressionist and graffiti art movements. Gormley came of age artistically during the New York City art boom years of the nineteen eighties when both neo-expressionism and street art raged as noted in an essay in the catalogue for Gormley's exhibition with Scott Borofsky alongside works by Keith Haring and Jean Michel Basquiat at the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center......\"Though Brian Gormley made few forays into street art per se, his paintings nonetheless reflect its energy and influence. In the mid-1980s, Gormley began showing expressionistic oils with figural motifs, distinguished by wild color and bravura brushwork.\" Of Irish ancestry Gormley today often exhibits in ancestral homeland where he maintains a residence. Such showings have included at The Cooper House Gallery (November 21 – December 3, 2013) and works from his collaborative book with poet Michael Carter, \"On Bolus Head\", at the Trinity College Library (March 25 until April 30, 2013) both in Dublin."

  "text" : "Beata Rosenhane (21 January 1638 in Norrköping – 1 June 1674) was a Swedish Baroness and writer. She was known for her learning and received an education unusual for a female of her epoch, and has as such been the subject of research. Beata Rosenhane was the daughter of Beata Sparre and the diplomat Baron Schering Rosenhane. As a Swedish diplomat, her father was stationed abroad at several occasions, and it is believed that it was during his visit to Paris in France during the age of the Précieuses, when it was the fashion in France to educate females, that he decided to give his daughters equal education to that of his sons, something unique at the time at least in Sweden. The result was that his daughters are counted as the most learned and educated females in 17th-century Sweden alongside Queen Christina. This was particular the case of Beata, who apparently was the most gifted among her sisters. From the age of seven onward, she was trained in rhetoric by conversation and by writing essays in various subjects in which she was also, in parallel, educated. She also wrote poetry and acquired a literary reputation, though her poems were not published: \"She had a rare talent, wide knowledge and great learning in the literature of foreign countries and has herself attempted poetry, though non of her writings has been printed\". Her poems as well as her written study work and books have been preserved and object of research. Beata Rosenhane long refused to marry, though she was, after the death of her father in 1663, pressured by her family to do so. She explained that she had seen many fiances become husbands and that she did not believe them capable of any love which could give a woman happiness: that she believed that a marriage should be founded on love and that the man selected by her family was not to her taste and would not be able to pass the test and love her. Eventually, she saw herself forced to give in because of the alternative as a spinster, which would be even less independent than that of a wife. In accordance to the contemporary civil law, an unmarried woman regardless of age were placed under the guardianship under her closest male relative for life; and though a married woman was under the guardianship of her husband, she obtained legal majority as a widow. Before her marriage, she pointed out to her brother, that she gave in and agreed to marry only because as a spinster, she would not have the power to live by herself and do as she pleased, and that she would have been able to so, had she been born a male. She admitted that between the alternative of a wife and a spinster, the former was the better of two evils: \"You do of course find it necessary to realize, that an unmarried woman would be far worse off than an unhappily married one\". In 1671, she finally married colonel lieutenant Baron Erik Ribbing af Zernava (1640-1675). As was the custom in the Swedish nobility until the late 18th-century, she kept her own name after marriage. She died childless of the fever. Her brother, who disliked her way of thinking, resolved that her independence had been caused by her education, and made the decision that his own daughter would be raised without any education to become a woman without will."

In 2000 he moved to Milan, living there for 10 years before moving to New Delhi. In 2014 he moved back to Italy. According to AllMusic, Bugo was one of the most interesting and controversial artists to emerge from the Italian independent scene of the 1990s. Although he is beloved by fans and critics, others consider him a comedy act. Blending international sound and Italian lyrics, Bugo became a cantautore (singer-songwriter) of the 2000s who moved the political songs of the 1970s into the disillusioned songwriting of the 2000s. He is considered a pioneer of the Italian singer-songwriter scene, and the neologism fantautore has been coined to describe him."

An important figure and board member of the Jewish group in Vienna during the early stages of the war, he was also an \"Ältester\" (council elder) of the Judenrat in the Theresienstadt concentration camp after 1943. He was the only \"Judenältester\" to survive the Holocaust and has been credited with saving the lives of thousands of Jews by assisting in their emigration, while also being accused of being a Nazi collaborator. Murmelstein spent his final years in Rome, repudiated by the Jewish community because of his role in the Holocaust. He was interviewed by Claude Lanzmann in 1975 and was the subject of a posthumous 2013 documentary, The Last of the Unjust, based on the interviews. He died in obscurity, but since the release of the documentary he and his role in the Holocaust have become the subject of increased media and scholarly attention."

  "text" : "Birgit Friedmann (born 8 April 1960) is a German former middle- and long-distance runner who competed in the 1500 metres and 3000 metres for West Germany. Born in Königstein im Taunus, she made her first major appearance for West Germany at the 1977 European Athletics Junior Championships, where she finished seventh in the 1500 m. The following year she won the national title in the 3000 m at the West German Athletics Championships and was also runner-up to Brigitte Kraus in the 1500 m. She was selected to run the longer event at the 1978 European Athletics Championships, but failed to finish the race. She represented her country at the 1979 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and came 71st while the West German women placed fourth overall. Friedmann had her greatest success in 1980. She won the West German title in the 3000 m with a run of 9:02 minutes. This gained her selection for the 1980 World Championships in Athletics – a two-event competition created by the International Amateur Athletics Federation in response to the lack of the women's 400 metres hurdles and 3000 m run at the 1980 Summer Olympics. Friedmann defeated all-comers at the competition and became the first ever women's 3000 m world champion with a personal best run of 8:48.05 minutes (also a West German record). The year after she won her third 3000 m national title and also placed third in the 1500 m. She also won the semi-final 1981 European Cup competition. At the 1982 European Athletics Championships Friedmann achieved a West German and world junior record of 8:43.65 for the 3000 m, but this was only enough for fifth place. She also competed over 1500 m at that championships, but was some way behind the winner in eleventh place. The 1982 season was her last as an athlete and she won her fourth and final national title that year. During her career she was affiliated with Eintracht Frankfurt and was 1.66 m tall and weighed 51 kg. Following her retirement from athletics she trained in sports medicine. She is the chief physician of the Sports Medicine Ward of the University Clinic in Heidelberg. In 2006 she co-authored a training manual, with fellow former athletes Herbert Steffny and Markus Keller, called Marathontraining für Frauen (Marathon Training for Women)."

  "text" : "Benjamin Alcock was born in Kilkenny, Ireland in 1801. He was the youngest of the five children of a noted doctor, Nathaniel Alcock. He became an accomplished anatomist working for some time under the leading Irish surgeon, Abraham Colles, of the Colles' fracture named after him. After studying at Kilkenny College, he studied anatomy at Dublin's Trinity College graduating in 1821. In 1825 Alcock became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and gained his master's degree from the University of Dublin in 1827. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons later that year. He had begun teaching in 1825 working firstly as a Demonstrator of Anatomy and then as a teacher of anatomy from 1836. In 1837 Alcock became the first Professor of anatomy, physiology and pathology at Queen's College, Cork working there for more than ten years at the Apothecaries' Hall. When the medical school opened there in 1849 he took up the post of Professor of anatomy. However, he was only there for a few years when he was asked to resign in 1854. This came about after a major disagreement that he had with the school's administration concerning the procurement of corpses, (following the passing of the Anatomy Act 1832). In brief, a scarcity of available corpses had led to the school's suggestion that Alcock pretend to be connected to people who had died in the workhouse and thereby able to claim their bodies (for disposal). For his stance against taking part in such dishonesty he was asked for his resignation, which he gave in 1854. However he appealed against this resignation request which was unsuccessful and so he was dismissed in 1855. A few years later in 1859, with no employment or employment prospects in Ireland, he left for America and was not heard of again. Benjamin Alcock is remembered for his description of the pudendal nerve sheath which came to be known as Alcock's canal, and an associated disease Alcock's canal syndrome also known as pudendal nerve entrapment or pudendal neuralgia."

  "text" : "Barry \"The Snake\" Fry (born c. 1939) is a Canadian curler from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Fry is a former Brier champion and is the father of 2014 Olympic gold medalist Ryan Fry. Fry was nicknamed \"The Snake\" for his quick delivery from the hack. Fry won his first national title in 1973, when he won the Canadian Mixed Curling Championship for Manitoba with teammates Peggy Casselman, Stephen Decter and Susan Lynch. Fry, Casselman, Winston Warren and Helene Paton had previously won a provincial mixed title in 1970. After 16 unsuccessful attempts, Fry finally won a Manitoba provincial men's title in 1979, with his rink of Bill Carey, Gordon Sparkes and Bryan Wood. The team then represented Manitoba at the 1979 Macdonald Brier. At the Brier, the team prevailed through poor playing conditions using a conservative hitting style to win the championship. The team suffered just one loss at the Brier, to Saskatchewan's Rick Folk. Fry's 10-1 record was enough to finish first place, while Folk's Saskatchewan team finished tied for second with an 8-3 record. The Brier win sent the Fry rink to the 1979 Air Canada Silver Broom, the World Curling Championships in Switzerland, representing Canada. At the Silver Broom, the team wrapped up the round robin with a 6-3 record, tied with three other countries in 2nd. The team lost to Norway's Kristian Sørum in their semi-final match up, settling for a bronze medal. After 1979, Fry's only other Brier appearance came at the 1998 Labatt Brier as Manitoba's alternate. However, he did not play in a single match. After turning 50, Fry graduated to Senior's curling. In 1992, Fry won the provincial senior's championships with teammates Don Duguid, Barry Coleman and Don McDonald. Fry and Duguid, another former Brier champion won two more provincial senior championships together in 1994 and 1995. They won both of those tournaments with a new front end which included two other former Brier champions Terry Braunstein and Ray Turnbull. After turning 60, Fry graduated to the Masters level, and won a provincial and Canadian Masters Curling Championships in 2001 with Duguid, Warren and Coleman at lead."

  "text" : "Billy Zeoli is an American evangelical media executive producer from Grand Rapids, Michigan who once served as a White house chaplain to U.S. President Gerald R. Ford and Betty Ford during the mid-1970s and who offered advice as a spiritual counselor to President Ford on the question of issuing a pardon to former U.S. President Richard Nixon, who had resigned following the Watergate scandal as a result of the June 17, 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C., and the Nixon administration's attempted cover-up of its involvement. Zeoli previously led the then U.S. Rep. Gerald R. Ford to become a Christian during a prayer breakfast being held in Washington, D.C. for the Washington Redskins professional football team. Zeoli received recognition as a minister to several American major league professional sport teams and athletes. Zeloi was also instrumental in bringing together the American missionary theologian Francis Schaeffer of the L'Abri in Huémoz-sur-Ollon, Switzerland and his son, Frank Schaeffer with wealthy American evangelicals (such as Amway co-founder and multi-billionaire Richard DeVos) for the financial backing of the How Should We Then Live: The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture 1997 film and 2005 television series. The American distribution of the How Should We Then Live: The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture book, the U.S. distribution of the film of the same title by Zeoli's Gospel Films, Inc., and subsequent film tour in the United States by the Schaeffers was responsible for bringing many evangelical Protestants into the then largely Roman Catholic public protest movement against the United States Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) supporting legal abortion in the United States. Zeoli was also the former Co-Chair (along with Amway President Doug DeVos) of Gospel Communications International. Gospel Communications International developed the BibleGateway.com web site and also trained and hosted hundreds of evangelical ministries on the World Wide Web beginning in 1995. Gospel Communications International both sold the BibleGateway.com web site and ceased operations on December 15, 2008."

  "text" : "Barbara Johnstone is a Professor of Rhetoric and Linguistics at Carnegie Mellon University. She specializes in discourse structure and function, sociolinguistics, rhetorical theory, and methods of text analysis. She was the editor in chief of Language in Society from 2005 to 2013, and is the editor of Pittsburgh Speech & Society, a website about Pittsburgh English for non-linguists. She has published several books, including Speaking Pittsburghese (2013) and Discourse Analysis, 2nd Ed. (2008). She has also written for The New York Times. Johnstone is recognized as an expert on Pittsburgh English, locally known as \"Pittsburghese.\" Her research is concerned with how the dialect is \"constructed through local talk, and talk about talk,\" connecting \"people's understandings of language and place\" with language change. Her 2013 book Speaking Pittsburghese: The Story of a Dialect, is a summation of her scholarly work on Pittsburgh English. The book is a sociolinguistic analysis of the history of Pittsburgh English and how it has changed over time, with a focus on the process of enregisterment and how the dialect is linked to local identity. It also explores the history and local use of some of Pittsburgh's most emblematic words, including \"yinz,\" \"nebby,\" and \"dahntahn.\" Johnstone has also written extensively about style-shifting among Texas women, the \"Linguistic Individual,\" gender and language, Arabic language discourse, as well as many other linguistic topics."

He participated in two short track speed skating events, the men's 500 metres (24th) and the men's 1000 metres (29th). The Mongolian team was originally unable to qualify any athletes for the 1994 Winter Olympics because of stricter standards ordered by international sporting federations, but when the North Korean team elected not to participate, several spots opened up in short track speed skating. By then, the Mongolians had left their temporary training base in Germany and headed home. Bat-Orgil, one of those eligible, needed eight days to reach Mongolia by train. When he arrived, a fax was waiting from the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee. Bat-Orgil got back on the train and headed west. He missed the opening ceremony but was able to participate in the closing ceremony as a flagbearer for Mongolia."

  "text" : "Belu Zilber (born Herbert Zilber; October 14, 1901–February 1978) was a Romanian communist activist. Born into a Jewish family in Târgu Frumos, Iași County, he adhered to the Bolshevik movement while still an adolescent. Because he participated in the typographers' demonstration of December 13, 1918, he was expelled from every educational institution in his native country by the authorities of the Kingdom of Romania. He continued his high school education in Paris and began but did not complete studies at the polytechnic division of the University of Grenoble. He returned to Romania in 1922 and was hired as an expert at the War Ministry. He was recruited as a Soviet spy in Vienna in 1928; arrested in Romania in December 1930, he agreed to become an informant for the Siguranța secret police. At his trial for espionage on the Soviets' behalf, he was initially sentenced to five years at hard labor, but was retried and acquitted in 1932. That year, he began working at an institute led by Virgil Madgearu, where he remained until 1947. During the rest of the decade, Zilber, characterized as \"cultured, voluble and ubiquitous\", and known in the cultural circles of Bucharest, led an underground life as a member of the banned Romanian Communist Party working to destroy \"bourgeois democracy\", an informer and a spy, but also lived the seemingly normal life of a bourgeois desirous of prosperity. Following the King Michael Coup of August 1944, when the Communist Party was made legal, he became the closest collaborator of his friend Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, who became Justice Minister. Zilber was arrested in 1948, together with Pătrășcanu, and imprisoned following a show trial. He was released in 1964. He died in 1978. Following incineration at the Cenușa crematorium, his ashes were taken to Cișmigiu Gardens, where they were scattered under a bush near the bust of George Panu, among the magnolias he often admired. His memoirs appeared posthumously in 1997, some years after the 1989 fall of the regime."

  "text" : "Bill Long (died 2000) was a pharmacist and politician from the U.S. state of Indiana. A longtime resident of Lafayette, he served ten years in the Indiana House of Representatives as a Republican. After service in the United States Coast Guard during the Second World War, Long became a pharmacist in the city of Lafayette. While living on Ninth Street in the city's Highland Park neighborhood, he served eight years as a city councilman before being elected to the House of Representatives for the 98th General Assembly, beginning in 1973. Professionally, he was active in the Kiwanis and the local chamber of commerce, and he was a member of the Reformed Presbyterian Church. Long had no single predecessor; the entirety of Tippecanoe County was an electoral district for the 97th General Assembly, sending two representatives to Indianapolis. Throughout his time in office, Long's 29th District embraced most of the southeastern quarter and parts of the northeastern quarter of Tippecanoe County. Long held the following committee assignments: \n* 1973-1974: Ways and Means (ranking member of Budget subcommittee), Cities and Towns \n* 1975-1976: Ways and Means (ranking minority member of Budget subcommittee), County and Township \n* 1977-1978: Ways and Means (chairman), Cities and Towns; Interstate Cooperation \n* 1979-1980: Ways and Means (chairman) \n* 1981-1982: Ways and Means (chairman); Interstate Cooperation The boundaries of Indiana House districts were reapportioned in time for the elections of November 1982; the 29th District was moved to embrace Tipton County and parts of Clinton, Hamilton, and Howard counties, and Lafayette was brought into the 27th District. Long was not re-elected to the House in 1982, and the race for the 27th District seat was won by Sheila J. Klinker, a Democrat from Lafayette. Long died on 14 March 2000. He was briefly memorialized at the next meeting of the highest governing body of his church, due to his service as an elder in his local congregation."
