  "text" : "Clara Carl, born Clara Green, was the daughter of a Straitsville, Ohio farmer. She and her childhood sweetheart Robert Gibson eloped in March 14, 1908 at Covington, Kentucky and moved to Cleveland where he continued to be a teacher while she became a writer for a newspaper. The couple came up with a get-rich-quick scheme where they travelled from town to town, writing and selling books of local historic areas. Their plan failed. While in Huntsville, Missouri, Robert became ill with an unusual illness. He died March 18, 1920, leaving Clara a widow and the sole beneficiary of a $3,000 life insurance policy. A few months after her first husband's death, Clara met and married Frank Carl in September 14, 1920 with the impression that he was wealthy. This was a tumultuous relationship and at one point, Mrs. Carl filed a complaint for divorce against her husband from the Hancock Circuit Court. When asked by Mrs. Lizzie Maynard what her grounds for divorce were, Clara replied that \"if the law did not provide a way there was always some way.\" In order to get her to drop the divorce lawsuit, Frank made her the sole beneficiary of his life insurance policy, worth $2,000. In 1921, Clara and Frank invited Frank's elderly father, Alonzo Carl, 85, to come live with them in Philadelphia, Indiana. According to Frank's brother, Herman Carl, his father was in good health when he went to live with the couple. Like Clara's first husband, Alozo became gravely ill by an unknown illness and died August 1921. Expecting property from her father-in-law, Clara was furious to find that it had been given to her husband's brother-in-law Dr. Iles. Two months later, Frank was dead, suffering the same illness. The day after her husband's funeral, Clara asked Herman to meet with her to discuss obtaining Alonzo's property from Dr. Iles. Her suspicious actions aroused skepticism among her neighbors who demanded an investigation. Frank and Alonzo's bodies were exhumed, revealing that each man had enough arsenic in his system \"'to kill a dozen men,' according to the prosecutor.\" Clara was arrested and charged January 1922. During her trial, Miss Rhoda Loehr testified that in July 1921, Clara bought arsenic sighting that \"neighborhood cats had been stealing her chickens [and] she said she wanted to kill the cats.\" Evidence of arsenic in her second husband and father-in-law revealed this to be true. An investigation into her first husband's death revealed the same results. Clara was found guilty of second degree murder and sentenced to life in prison at the Indiana Women's prison at Indianapolis. She was \"considered one of the most daring woman criminals in the country\" earning the nickname \"feminine Bluebeard.\" While in prison, Clara made a daring and cunning escape in early October 1925. She was assigned outdoor work due to ill health and became a \"trusty,\" earning the trust of prison guards after 3 years of good behavior. Clara was assigned to feeding the prison-yard chickens. One evening, she climbed up one of the chicken coops, hopped the prison wall and escaped. She evaded police for about a week before her re-capture. At aged 54, Clara was paroled on May 26, 1937, 15 years after she was convicted of murder."

He was also a member of the keshik. Chormaqan is mentioned in The Secret History of Mongols many times. He probably participated in the Mongol campaigns in North China and later in the Subutai's and Jebe's famous journey through Caucasus and Russian steppes. Appointed by Ögedei in the winter of 1230 to renew the Mongol conquests in Persia, which had languished since Genghis Khan's assault on and near destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire from 1218 to 1223. At the approach of Chormagan and the new Mongol army, the Khwarezmids under Jalal ad-Din were swept away. Further campaigns in the mid-1230s, based from the steppes in Azerbaijan around Tabriz, firmly established the Kingdom of Georgia and Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia as vassals. It is theorized that these moves may have been made to secure communications for the attack westward led by Batu that followed shortly thereafter. Chormaqan died around 1241 and was replaced by Baiju, his lieutenant. His son Shiramun later served under the Il-khans Hulagu and Abaqa. His daughter Esukan was married to King David VII of Georgia."

  "text" : "Edward Christopher Rees (born 1930 or 1931 - 2001), known as Chris Rees, was a Welsh nationalist politician. Rees grew up in Swansea and joined Plaid Cymru at an early age. In 1951, he refused to do National Service, on the grounds that he was Welsh, and was sentenced to a year in prison. While imprisoned again later, he stood for the party in Gower at the 1955 general election, taking just over 10% of the vote. He later stood at the Swansea East by-election, 1963, and again in the seat in 1964 and 1966, then in Merthyr Tydfil in 1970, but was never elected. In 1964, Rees was elected as Vice President of Plaid, unexpectedly beating Elystan Morgan, who was seen as the more conservative candidate. In 1966, Rees instead became the first Chairman of the party, serving until 1970. Although Rees grew up in an English-speaking family, he learned Welsh as an adult, and it became his main language. He became a college lecturer, and by 1970 was Director of Policy for Plaid. In this role, he produced a detailed language policy which was adopted by the party. In 1973, Rees adapted the Ulpan system of language learning for Welsh learners, renaming it Wlpan, and from 1975, he focused on running the Centre for Teaching the Welsh Language to Adults, based at what became Cardiff University."

  "text" : "Catherine Ann Jones is an award-winning playwright, screenwriter, and author. She wrote the screenplay for the film The Christmas Wife  and Unlikely Angel.  She wrote several episodes of the television series Touched by an Angel. She has written two books about writing The Way of Story: The Craft & Soul of Writing and Heal Your Self with Writing (Nautilus Book Award 2014). After playing major roles in more than fifty plays including on Broadway, she became disappointed by the lack of good roles for women and wrote a play about Virginia Woolf, titled On the Edge. The play was written before many of Woolf's diaries were published but was prescient in understanding how Woolf was thinking. The play won a National Endowment for the Arts Award and the Aspen Playwrights Conference Award and the Eugene O'Neill Award. Ten of Jones's plays, including Calamity Jane (both play and musical) and The Women of Cedar Creek, have won multiple awards. She holds a graduate degree in Depth Psychology and Archetypal Mythology from Pacifica Graduate Institute, where she has also taught. She received a Fulbright Research Scholar award to study shamanism in India. She has taught at The New School University, University of Southern California, Pacifica Graduate Institute, and the Esalen and the Omega Institutes. She has been a panelist at the Ojai Film Festival. Terri Belford has described Catherine Ann Jones as a \"socially responsible screen writer.\""

  "text" : "Carl (or Karl) Otto Harz (28 November 1842 in Gammertingen – 5 December 1906 in Munich) was a German mycologist, pharmacist and botanist. After spending time as an intern in several pharmacies, he studied botany at the University of Berlin. Later, he relocated to Munich, where he served as a lecturer at the Technische Universität München (from 1873) and at the Tierärztlichen Hochschule (from 1874). In 1880 he was appointed professor of botany and pharmacognosy at the Tierärztlichen Hochschule. In 1877, with pathologist Otto Bollinger, he conducted early studies of actinomycosis in cattle, and is credited for naming the causal agent Actinomyces bovis. From his observations, he believed the culprit to be a mould, related to the genera Botrytis or Monosporium. As a taxonomist, he circumscribed a number of varieities from the species Cucurbita pepo. His name is associated with the following mycological genera: \n*  Harzia (family Ceratostomataceae), named by Julien Noël Costantin (1888). \n*  Harziella (family Chaetomiaceae), named by Otto Kuntze (1891)."

He made three appearances in the 1983 VFL season, the first in round nine, against the Sydney Swans. The following week he had 17 disposals in a loss to Fitzroy, then lost his place in the team with a groin injury. He returned in round 22 to play St Kilda at Victoria Park, which would be his final game. Back at Mayne, after a stint with West Adelaide, Herbert won three consecutive club best and fairest awards, from 1992 to 1994. He was also Mayne captain in each of those years, as well as the 1995 season. Aspley's senior best and fairest award is named after Herbert, who had been an Aspley junior."

  "text" : "Christopher Bailey is an occasional screenwriter for television, particularly noted for his work on Doctor Who, and a lecturer in English at the University of Brighton. The first of Bailey's scripts for Doctor Who, Kinda, broadcast in 1982, was analysed in detail by the first major scholarly work dedicated to Doctor Who. Doctor Who: The Unfolding Text by Tulloch and Alvarado included analysis of Kinda's Buddhist and Jungian symbology and related its tropes to Ursula K. Le Guin. The strength of the script for Kinda led to Bailey writing a sequel in 1983, Snakedance. Script editor Eric Saward requested that Bailey devise another story idea. The initial outline for May Time was commissioned on 24 August 1982 and was about the Doctor and his companions arriving at the court of Byzantium. Full scripts were commissioned on 16 September 1982 with the new title Man-watch, but the scripts were dropped from production for unclear reasons. Another storyline under the title The Children of Seth was commissioned on 14 July 1983, but not developed further. It was later adapted by Marc Platt for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in December 2011. Christopher Bailey was the inspiration for the character of Martin Bannister, played by Derek Jacobi in an audio play by Robert Shearman. Bailey had the reputation as a reluctant interviewee, but was interviewed by Benjamin Cook in 2002, and also by Shearman for the 2011 BBC DVD release of his two 1980s Doctor Who stories, collected as Mara Tales."

  "text" : "Charles L. Meach, III (1948–2004) was a mentally ill American murderer who killed five people in Alaska. He was born in Traverse City, Michigan, to a mother who battled with schizophrenia. He left home at sixteen to travel and accumulated a long record of minor crimes. He made his way to Anchorage, Alaska, and in 1973 he beat 22-year-old Robert Johnson who worked as a grocery clerk to death in Earthquake Park. He was charged with murder and found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital in California. In 1980 psychiatrists decided that his illness was in remission and he was returned to Alaska under the supervision of the Alaska Psychiatric Institute. On May 3, 1982, he shot four teenagers to death in Russian Jack Springs Park; two 19-year-old boys while robbing their campsite and two 16-year-old girls who came to investigate the gunshots. He confessed to the killings when confronted and was charged. He again pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, but was convicted and sentenced to 396 years in prison without the possibility of parole — the longest sentence in the state's history. In response to the shootings, the Alaska Legislature revised the criminal statutes on the sentencing of the mentally ill, providing for a new verdict \"guilty, but mentally ill\" where the convicted will serve their time in a mental institution until deemed healthy, then be transferred to prison for the rest of their sentence. This revision did not apply to Meach's trial, though. The legislature also narrowed the definition of insanity and tightened the burden of proof for the basic insanity defense. This resulted in Alaska having one of the most strict conditions for the insanity defense of all the US states. He died of natural causes on December 9, 2004 in the Cook Inlet jail."

Martin was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Calgary, Chair of Philosophy at the University of Sydney, and past President of the Australasian Philosophical Association. Inspired by John Locke, he was an early proponent of causal theories of perception, knowledge, and memory, and a principal architect of Australian metaphysical realism. He advocated an uncompromising materialist conception of minds as complex neurologically based propensities for the manipulation of sensory materials. The \"ofness\" and \"aboutness\" of thoughts and images arises from their dispositional realizations in the nervous system. More generally, Martin held that property instances invariably possess both dispositional and non-dispositional aspects, and that causal transactions are best regarded, not as relations between distinct events, but as the \"mutual manifestations of reciprocal dispositional property partners.\""

  "text" : "Charles Clark (19 April 1838 – 29 March 1903) was a Baptist minister and lecturer. Clark was born in London and entered the Baptist College at Nottingham as a student for the ministry. After filling several charges in London and the provinces, he accepted the pastorate of the Baptist Church in Albert Park, Melbourne, Victoria (Australia) where he arrived in April 1869. Having been very successful as an amateur lecturer on secular subjects, Clark resigned his pastoral charge in 1874, and lectured professionally throughout the Australian colonies with extraordinary success. Mr. Clark was gifted with a wonderfully retentive memory, great dramatic force, a powerful and melodious voice, and, above all, a fine quality of delicate sympathy and largeheartedness which brought him into direct touch with the public, and instinctively prompted him to select for his themes subjects which appealed to the emotions and loftier sensibilities of all classes of the community. Acting on the maxim 'The highest study of mankind is man,' Mr. Clark committed to memory the choicest selections from the writings of Charles Dickens, and recited them with such remarkable displays of feeling as to move his hearers either to laughter or to tears; He was just the kind of man to enter into the spirit of Dickens's works, and to represent him fairly; for, like that immortal author, he had wide sympathies for all that is human, a keen eye for the grotesque, and a profound contempt for all hypocrisies, and make-believes. But his repertoire covered an extensive and interesting field, and his chief aim was to convey instruction on the history and poetry of the British nation. A lecture on 'Christmas in Old England' was repeated hundreds of times, and another on the 'Tower of London' was immensely .successful. After a tour in America in 1876, where he attracted large audiences, he returned to Australia, but shortly afterwards left for England, where he remained till 1889, when he revisited Australia, and achieved a considerable measure of his former success. He again toured Australia in 1896, which was also a success. Clark died on 29 March 1903 in Bristol, Gloucestershire, England."

Grant's photographs were published in numerous newspapers and magazines, including Paris Match, Newsweek and Time; five of his feature photos were published on the back page of issues of Life magazine. Grant was on assignment in November 1963 to cover President John F. Kennedy's trip from Washington, D.C., to Dallas. One of his photographs made the front page of the November 22 edition of the Morning News; a copy is believed to be the last thing Kennedy ever signed. Grant also would make several pictures at Parkland Memorial Hospital within minutes after Kennedy's motorcade arrived following the shooting in Dealey Plaza. Grant was the recipient of multiple photojournalism awards during his career, including the Medallion for Excellence in Photojournalism. He retired from The Dallas Morning News in 1986, but continued working in a semi-retired capacity for more than a decade thereafter. He died in Dallas of heart failure at age 93."

  "text" : "Charles Edward Borden; also Carl Borden; (15 May 1905 – 25 December 1978) was an American-Canadian professor of archaeology at the University of British Columbia and the author of seminal works on archaeology, pre-history and pre-contact history. He was of German descent. The Canadian Archaeological Association referred to him as the grandfather of archaeology in British Columbia and especially regarding prehistory and early history and rendered outstanding services to British Columbia. The Borden System was used on all archaeological sites. Borden deemed the Milliken site in the Fraser Canyon, with finds dating back about 9500 years old, making it the oldest known settlement at the time, therefore the most important of the excavations at sites. In 1951 Borden received funding from Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan), and the British Columbia Ministry of Education to undertake salvage archaeology at the Carrier Indian site. The construction of the Kemano power reservoir resulted in imminent flooding of a large part of Carrier hunting territory in Tweedsmuir Park. In 1951 Borden began survey and excavation of the site and returned to work there every summer until he retired in 1970. His final article published in Science in 1979 was based on excavations of early microblade assemblages at Namu in 1977. From 1948 to 1957, Borden excavated material and undertook salvage archaeology projects in the 1950s and 1960s at the Marpole Midden, also known as Great Marpole Midden. Borden \"was the first to draw links between contemporary Musqueam peoples and excavated remains.\" At the time of his death, however in 1978, in spite of his best intentions, all of the Marpole material was in storage and still required \"full description, quantification and publication of the original data\" on which they were based."

  "text" : "Chansonetta Stanley Emmons (1858–1937) was a female photographer in the 19th and early 20th century. Emmons' photography depicts scenes of domestic life and New England rural landscape. Born December 30, 1858 in the mill town of Kingfield, Maine, the young Chansonetta Stanley grew interested in photography after her brothers' (Francis E. and Freelan O. Stanley) dry-plate printing invention. (The brothers also invented a steam-powered automobile known as the Stanley Steamer). On February 2, 1887, she married James Nathaniel Whitman Emmons. Her brother Freelan O. Stanley bought her a large house at 22 Harley Street in Ashmont Hill, Dorchester, Massachusetts. in 1895. Chansonetta gave birth in 1891 to a daughter, Dorothy Stanley Emmons, and there exist photographs of the Emmons home and family scenes in Dorchester from the 1890s. After her husband James died in 1898 of blood poisoning at the age of 41, Chansonetta and Dorothy were forced to leave Dorchester and move to Newton, Massachusetts. Chansonetta viewed photography as a way to supplement her income after her husband's death, participating in photographic competitions, camera club exhibitions and lectures which featured her photography reproduced as hand-colored glass lantern slides. Her wealthy brothers also gave financial support throughout her life. Chansonetta is unique in that relatively few photographers, especially women, in the beginning of the 20th century were focused on the \"domestic vernacular\" especially in rural northern New England. Chansonetta died at age 79 in 1937. Content is mainly from the Dorchester Atheneum website. The Stanley Museum in Kingfield, Maine owns the largest collection of Chansonetta Stanley Emmons photographic prints and glass plate negatives in the world including her brilliantly hand-colored glass lantern slides. Her earliest photographs consists of images of her family house in Dorchester."

  "text" : "Charles Rous-Marten (1842–1908) was a New Zealand journalist and British railway writer and recorder. At the age of 16 his family emigrated to New Zealand, settling in Southland. In 1864 he was appointed Meteorological Director of Southland Province, a position he held until 1870. He was employed as a journalist with the Evening Post in Wellington about 1876 and was later editor, resigning in 1884. He was editor of the New Zealand Times, also in Wellington, from 1885 to 1890. In that year he was appointed London correspondent for a number of leading New Zealand newspapers, which he continued to do until shortly before he died. He took a close interest in railways over many years and in 1884 and 1885 he did a thorough study of the British rail network, involving around 40,000 miles of travel. In 1887 the results were embodied in a report to the New Zealand Minister of Public Works entitled Notes on the Railways of Great Britain, which received favourable reviews. He is chiefly known for recording a speed of 102.3 mph on the 'Ocean Mail' special from Plymouth to London hauled by GWR locomotive 3440 City of Truro on 9 May 1904, the first time that a steam locomotive was recorded to have achieved 100 mph. Between the years of 1902 and 1908 he wrote a series of articles for The Railway Magazine on British locomotive practice and performance. In 1990, these were collated and reprinted in book form."

  "text" : "For the Louisiana Cajun musician, see J. B. Fuselier. Charles Auguste Fuselier, Sr. (born December 1942), is the retired sheriff of St. Martin Parish in South Louisiana. Known for innovations in his office, Fuselier was the sheriff from 1980 until c. 2003, when he resigned prior to the nonpartisan blanket primary for what would have been his seventh term. Fuselier's father, Charles J. Fuselier, was the sheriff prior to 1978, when he died in office. Fuselier was elected sheriff in 1979 and took office in the summer of 1980, after the two-year interim period of Sheriff Allan B. Durand (1919–2006). Durand had been chief deputy under the first Sheriff Fuselier and continued thereafter as first deputy under Charles A. Fuselier until Durand's retirement. He was reelected in 1983 with more than 86 percent of the ballots cast. In his last contested re-election in 1995, Fuselier polled more than 65 percent of the vote over three opponents. He was succeeded by Ronald J. \"Ronny\" Theriot (born 1946), an Independent and former major with the Louisiana State Police, who assumed the office on October 16, 2003. In 1983, Fuselier oversaw the completion of a new jail; in 1990, the installation of a parish-wide 911 system; in 1991, the creation of a sheriff's substation, and in 1995, the construction of a facility for juveniles. In 1996, he received the National Sheriff of the Year award, an honor for which he expressed \"shock\". Then U.S. Representative Jimmy Hayes of Louisiana's 7th congressional district, since disbanded, honored Fuselier in a speech delivered on the floor of Congress. In his address, Hayes noted that Fuselier initiated a local partnership between the sheriff's office, the St. Martinville chief of police, and the American Association of Retired Persons to create the first TRIAD program in St. Martin Parish, which works to prevent crimes against senior citizens. In 1999, the St. Martin Parish sheriff's office under Fuselier became the first in Louisiana to receive the imprint of the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. Though Fuselier's political career occurred while he was a Democrat, the office of Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler lists Fuselier and his wife, the former Lyndahl Hobgood (born June 1943), as Republican voters, as of December 2013. As a student from 1953 to 1959 at St. Martinville Senior High School, an entity of the St. Martin Parish School Board, Fuselier was active in 4-H. Thereafter, as sheriff he was heavily involved in the promotion of 4-H programs. In 1981, he established the Charles Fuselier Livestock Award, named for his father, and the subsequent Charles Fuselier Scholarship in 2002. In 2008, he was inducted into the 4-H Hall of Fame, housed in a museum in Avoyelles Parish south of Alexandria. In 2003, Fuselier was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. As of 2014, only four other sheriffs have received this designation, Cat Doucet, Leonard R. \"Pop\" Hataway, Harry Lee, and Jessel Ourso."

  "text" : "Carl August von der Meden (6 December 1841 – 23 May 1911) was the first president of the Deutscher Tennis Bund (English: German Tennis Federation) and was called the Father of lawn tennis in Germany. Von der Meden was born on 6 December 1841, the son of a Hamburg merchant and real estate agent. For over a decade he lived in England and worked in the financial district of London. On his way to work he passed the All England Club in Wimbledon. On 9 December 1868 he married Sophie Mathlde Eckhardt in Bradford and the couple had three daughters and one son. At the latest in 1881 he returned to Germany. He became the first chairman of the \"Uhlenhorster Eislauf-Vereins\". This Hamburg club, founded in 1888, had added tennis to its activities and in 1892 organized the first German Championships. Von der Meden was the tournament director, a function which he later also fulfilled for the Bad Homburg tournament which hosted the German Championships between 1897 and 1901. In 1901 von der Meden became chairman of the Hamburger Tennis-Gilde, a cooperation of Hamburg tennisclubs. On 19 May 1902 he was part of the meeting in Berlin that founded the Deutscher Lawn Tennis Bund and he was elected its first president. Von der Meden died on 23 May 1911, aged 69. The matches in the German tennis league are called the Medenspiele (English: Meden games) in his honor."

The event was important at the start of the Second Intifada. Few months after Enderlin's report, a small group of people in France (Gérard Huber, Philippe Karsenty, Luc Rosenzweig) launched a controversy with legal suits against France 2, and various accusations, from the contestation of the origin the bullets that killed young al-Durrah to the allegation of a \"staging\" of the whole scene."

In those years Reims won under coach Albert Batteux the championships of 1953 and 1955, but in those seasons Prosdocimi played only one match in 1954–55. Michel Leblond, Michel Hidalgo, Robert Jonquet and Raymond Kopa were alongside his better known team-mates. In later years Claude Prosdocimni had two stints as coach of the club. In late April 1964 he replaced Robert Jonquet for the remainder of the season and in January 1979 he succeeded Jean-Claude D'Arménia and Pierre Flamion.

  "text" : "Dr Conn McCluskey (1914-16 December 2013) was an Irish civil rights activist in the 1960s, and a medical doctor. Born in County Down, McCluskey was working as a general practitioner in Dungannon, County Tyrone, in 1963, when along with his wife Patricia he founded the Homeless Citizens' League to draw attention to discrimination against the Catholic population in the allocation of public housing by the unionist-controlled local council. On 17 January 1964 the couple established the Campaign for Social Justice, with Patricia McCluskey as the first chairwoman, to broaden the focus of their campaign to cover all aspects of discrimination against the one-third Catholic minority in Northern Ireland. A pamphlet written by the McCluskeys, The Plain Truth, drew widespread attention to the issues. In January 1967 they helped to found the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), which became the main vehicle for the civil rights campaign that, following repressive counter-measures by the unionist government, was followed by the 30-year conflict known as The Troubles. In 1969, when a vacancy arose in the Mid-Ulster UK Parliamentary constituency, the McCluskeys organised a Unity Convention resulting in the nomination of Bernadette Devlin as the single, and victorious, anti-unionist candidate. Patricia McCluskey served for a time as an elected councillor in Dungannon, but the couple were not prominent in public life after the onset of the Troubles. In 1989 Conn published a memoir of their campaigning, Up Off Their Knees. The McCluskeys retired to Dublin, where Patricia died in 2010, aged 96. Conn died in 2013, and was buried in Burren, County Down. An annual McCluskey Civil Rights Summer School was established in Carlingford, County Louth, in 2008."

Webster and Co., named for Webster. Webster was born in Charlotte, New York in 1851 and married Annie Moffett, Mark Twain's niece, in 1875. The following year, Annie gave birth to a daughter, Alice Jane Chandler Webster. In 1881, Twain hired Webster to oversee the development one of Twain's investments for the Kaolatype process for making engraved printing plates. When Twain decided to start his own publishing company in 1884, he hired Webster to head the company and named it after him, promoting him to full partner in March 1885. Twain came to feel Webster was incompetent and removed him from the company in 1888, while retaining Webster's name. In his autobiography, Twain described Webster as \"one of the most assful persons I have ever met–perhaps the most assful.\" In a letter to Twain's brother, Orion Clemens, he wrote that he never hated anyone as much as he hated Webster. Webster's son, Samuel Charles Webster, published the book Mark Twain, Business Man in 1946 to rehabilitate his father's reputation. Webster died in Fredonia, New York on April 28, 1891."

  "text" : "Carlos Paton ('C.P.') Blacker GM MC FRCP (8 December 1895 – 21 April 1975) was an eminent war hero, psychiatrist and eugenicist who worked with R.A. Fisher and Lionel Penrose.Blacker was educated at Eton and Oxford where he attained distinction in biology under the tutelage of Julian Huxley. He served with the Coldstream Guards during World War I and was twice mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Military Cross, for action in which he was involved in on 15 September 1916. Twelve months previously he had lost his only sibling, a brother Robin, at Loos. Robin had also been an officer in the Coldstream Guards. C.P felt that war was dysgenic because it killed people who tended to be above the physical average and deterred thoughtful people from parenthood. He was deeply shaken by his war experience and in coming to terms with it and the loss of his brother and many of his contemporaries acknowledged a debt to Freud’s writings which stimulated in him an interest in psychiatry. Qualifying in medicine in 1925, Blacker became a registrar in Guy's Hospital’s psychiatric department for three years and continued his study at the Maudsley Hospital. He later became a part-time member of its teaching staff and was later the first chairman of the newly-established Simon Population Trust. In 1943, on active service, Blacker was awarded the George Medal. The official citation read: A corporal had walked into a minefield and was killed. A Guards officer and a sergeant who had laid the mines at that point walked into the minefield to bring back the corporal’s body. Captain Blacker warned them of the risk, but the sergeant, confident that he knew the positions of the mines, went on with the officer. The sergeant was killed when he stepped on a mine and the officer was seriously wounded. With no knowledge of the mine pattern and no one to help, Captain Blacker went immediately to the rescue of the wounded officer. The officer was saved and recovered from his wounds. From 1931 to 1952, Blacker was secretary of the Eugenics Society and he gave it a new focus on birth control and population planning. . His appointment as Secretary was \"not without some misgivings of [Leonard] Darwin, its chairman. The differences in outlook, aspirations and in judgement of these two men during their partnership in office in the Eugenics Society led to tensions which have been ably traced by Richard Soloway. Two prominent issues here were Darwin’s reluctance to endorse Blacker’s deep-rooted conviction that research and provision of contraception should be a major feature in the Eugenic Society’s strategy to reduce the fecundity of the lower, less able classes and his disagreement with Blacker’s aspiration to redirect more of the Eugenic Society’s effort from education and propaganda to research and promotion of contraception.\" Ann Thetis Blacker (1927–2006), the painter and singer, was a daughter of Carlos Blacker."

Ham born in Birmingham, Warwickshire, England, youngest son of Rev. John Ham and his wife Ann Job, née Tonkin. In 1842 the family arrived in the Port Phillip District (colony of Victoria from 1851) and John Ham became the first pastor of Collins Street Baptist Chapel, Melbourne. Cornelius Ham's eldest brother, Jabez, was one of the first editors of The Age, Melbourne. Cornelius Ham started business as a land and estate agent in Melbourne in 1855, and was Mayor of Melbourne in 1881-82. In November 1882 he stood for Melbourne Province in the Victorian Legislative Council in opposition to the late Dr. Beaney and George Selth Coppin, and was triumphantly returned, being sworn-in in December 1882 and holding the seat until May 1904. Ham accepted a seat in the James Munro Ministry without portfolio in November 1890, and was sworn of the Executive Council. Twelve months later he resigned office after voting against the Government Bill establishing the one man one vote principle, but resumed office on the measure being abandoned. In February 1892, however, when the Ministry was reconstructed under William Shiels, he left the Cabinet. He married in 1868 Hattie, daughter of John Latham, of West Virginia, U.S.A., formerly United States Consul-General in Melbourne. Ham died in Armadale, Victoria, Australia on 10 December 1909, survived by three sons and six daughters."

He entered Rugby School on 18 July 1816 and matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford on 27 February 1819, graduating BA on 25 November 1823 (in the lower portion of the second class in classics) and MA on 13 April 1825. Greaves was called to the bar by the Society of Lincoln's Inn on 22 November 1827, entered the Inner Temple ad eundem in 1828, and attended the Oxford Circuit and Gloucester Sessions. He became Queen's counsel on 28 February 1850, but by then he had for many years ceased to practise. He became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn on 15 April 1850.

  "text" : "Cyril Harold Goulden (b. Bridgend, Wales 2 June 1897; d. Ottawa 4 Feb 1981) was an eminent Welsh/Canadian geneticist, statistician and agronomist who studied under Karl Pearson. Son of a homesteader, Goulden took the course for farmers at the University of Saskatchewan and went on to do a PhD in plant breeding before becoming chief cereal breeder at the Dominion Rust Research Laboratory, Winnipeg, in 1925. In 1948 he succeeded L.H. Newman as Dominion cerealist and later became assistant deputy minister for research in the Dept of Agriculture. In 1937 Goulden wrote the first North American textbook on biostatistics. On May 14, 1954 when receiving an Honorary Degree from his alma mater, Goulden was greeted thus:Eminent Chancellor: I present to you a man whose name is indeed golden in the ears of prairie farmers, because he makes two stems of wheat grow where previously one had sickened and remained barren. He has been a general in the continuing warfare with the farmers' great and resourceful enemy, disease of cereal crops, frustrating that enemy by creating new varieties which it is powerless to attack. His latest creation to meet the latest thrust of the enemy, rust form 15B, has only recently been released and appropriately christened \"Selkirk.\" A distinguished alumnus of this university, Goulden was for many years in charge of the breeding of cereals at the Federal Rust Research Laboratory in Winnipeg. His achievements there included not only the successful production of new varieties but also much fundamental research which lay behind that success. At the same time he became known internationally as an investigator and author in the field of statistics particularly as applied to biological and agricultural problems. At present as Chief of the Division of Cereals of the Canada Department of Agriculture he holds one of Canada's most important scientific posts, directs the researches on cereal crops conducted by that department throughout the country, and influences all similar work in other institutions. Eminent Chancellor, on behalf of the Council and Senate of this university I ask that you confer on Cyril Harold Goulden the degree of Doctor of Laws, honoris causa. He also developed 6 varieties of rust-resistant oats."

  "text" : "Charles Simeon Hare (1808 – 22 July 1882) was a politician in colonial South Australia. Hare was born in London, England, and arrived in South Australia in September 1836, with Sir John Morphett, to whom he acted as private secretary, and was subsequently employed by the South Australian Company. He was a vigorous opponent of State aid to religion and transportation, and sat in the unicameral South Australian Legislative Council for West Torrens from July 1851 to June 1854, when he resigned. In January 1855 he was appointed a Commissioner for effectuating the wishes of Parliament in relation to the Adelaide and Gawler Railway Bill. On 5 March 1857 Hare was elected to the first South Australian Legislative Assembly for Yatala, but resigned on 12 May 1858, on being appointed Superintendent of the Stockade. Hare became Manager of Railways in succession to Mr. Drake, in July 1860, but was removed from office in May 1865, in consequence of an accident to a train carrying the Governor and Ministry, for which a Commission of Inquiry held him culpable. After an experience of several years as a planter in Fiji, Hare returned to South Australia and managed a mine near Moonta. In 1875 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Assembly, his defeat being due to his opposition to the men's demands during the great Moonta strike, in 1874. Hare represented the district of Wallaroo from 5 April 1878 to 10 April 1881, when he resigned and revisited England, returning to South Australia in the following year. Hare died on 22 July 1882 in Adelaide, South Australia, survived by his wife; he was buried in the West Terrace Cemetery."

He later worked with the state unit to forge ties with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam for the 2004 elections. In 2012, he courted arrest in Mettupalayam for protesting against action not being taken against culprits who assaulted a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activist.

Terry attended Winston-Salem State University where he was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in the fifth round (104th pick overall) during the 1978 NBA Draft, but was waived before playing in a game. He then took his talents to the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) where he played for the popular Toyota team, which he led to a conference championship (1978 PBA Invitational Conference). Two years later he signed with the Bullets. After his playing career was abruptly done, Terry's life was never the same. Alcoholism and drugs took over; in fact, in January 1989, Terry was convicted of cocaine distribution. Just two months later, at the age of 32, he was killed in a high-speed car crash on the Capital Beltway inPrince George's County, Maryland. Police said that Terry had been drinking and was speeding."

Cheah Kah Peng was born in Georgetown, Penang. Cheah 谢 is his family name, and Kah Peng 嘉平 is his given name. He attended Soo Chow University and University of Oxford where he studied law. He received the prestigious British Government Chevening Scholar Award and read law in Oxford. Living as a young traveller in Europe, Asia and Australia during the 1980s and 1990s he became involved in many civil and human rights campaign activities. He travelled widely as a painter, writer, filmmaker and human rights advocate before he returned to Malaysia from Australia during the mid 90s, and became one of the earliest founding members of a new Parti Keadilan Nasional 国民公正党 on 4 April 1999 (which subsequently amalgamated with Parti Rakyat Malaysia 马来西亚人民党 to become Parti Keadilan Rakyat 人民公正党). The political party he helped to construct focused on dismantling its colonial legacy of racial divide (or apartheid) through tackling institutionalised racism, poverty and inequality. He was elected as member of the party’s Supreme Council and served as central committee member from 1999 to 2010. He was reported to be one of the International Human Rights lawyers at risk in international journals from 1999 to 2003 during which he was one of the few lawyers who stood up against Malaysia’s draconian Internal Security Act. In the year 2000, he was arrested and imprisoned in Malaysia for a trumped up charge of obstructing police officers in execution of their duty while the truth was that he tried to stop the police from causing grievous bodily harm to political detainees. Cheah Kah Peng is currently the people’s representative or State Assemblyman 州立法议员 for Botanical Gardens 植物园 (Kebun Bunga) Penang and he remains a part-time painter writer filmmaker and human rights advocate."

He studied medicine and natural sciences at Jena and Heidelberg, where one of his instructors was Ernst Haeckel. In 1872, with Haeckel, he participated in scientific investigations in Montenegro and Dalmatia. After obtaining his medical doctorate (1875), he trained as an ophthalmologist and spent time as a military physician in Serbia. In 1877, he journeyed to South Africa, collecting botanical specimens in Natal and Transvaal, then travelling to Mozambique, Mauritius and Madagascar. He collected specimens on the northwestern coast of Madagascar prior to crossing the island to the eastern side near the village of Beravi. At the age of 27, he was murdered by local inhabitants in Madagascar. His specimens from Madagascar eventually came into the possession of Bremen botanist Franz Georg Philipp Buchenau, who issued a series of papers titled \"Reliquiae Rutenbergianae\". Here, he along with numerous other authors described Rutenberg's collections (605 total species, 5 new genera and 168 new species and varieities). The genus Rutenbergia (Geh. & Hampe ex Besch., 1880) is named after him. The standard author abbreviation Rutenb. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Caspar Coolhaes, or Koolhaas, (1536–1615) was a Reformed minister in the Netherlands and a libertine opponent of Calvinistic confessionalism. Caspar Coolhaes was born in Cologne in 1536. He studied at Düsseldorf. In 1566 he joined the Reformation. He pastored in the regions of Zweibruck and Nassau. In 1574 he accepted a professorship at the new University of Leiden. He became a noted figure in the 16th century in the Netherlands in the conflict between how the church and state should interact. An influx of strict Calvinists into Leiden lobbied for the church's freedom to deal harshly with heretics and impose punishments, while Protestants Coolhaes, Pieter Hackius, and others argued along with Thomas Erastus that it was right for the civil magistrates to maintain control over punishment and order, even in church matters. The dispute was engendered, in part, by the fear that the unfettered church could in theory create an increasingly totalitarian state with its own systems of punishments. A provincial synod at Haarlem eventually excommunicated Coolhaes on 25 March 1582 when he refused to sign the Belgic Confession. However, the city government of Leiden subsidized Coolhaes until 1586. He eventually resigned the professorship at the University of Leiden, and died a private teacher at Leiden in 1615. Because of his opposition to the Calvinist governmental model, opposition to the Calvinist doctrine of absolute predestination, Coolhaes' appeal for religious liberty, in combination with his professorship when Jacob Arminius was a student at Leiden, Coolhaes is considered by some as an important forerunner to Arminianism."

  "text" : "Christopher M. Bell (1974-December 25, 2009) was a disability studies scholar working in the area of HIV/AIDS, race and ethnicity. He was the former president of the Society for Disability Studies and contributed to national discussions about race, ethnicity and disability studies. His posthumously published anthology, Blackness and Disability: Critical Examinations and Cultural Interventions, grew from his early critique of disability studies as a \"white discipline\" that ignored the racial dimensions of studying disability. His 2006 essay, \"Introducing White Disability Studies: A Modest Beginning,\" was published in the second edition of the Disability Studies Reader and established him as a notable disability studies scholar."

  "text" : "Carmen Sylvia Mathews (May 8, 1911 – August 31, 1995) was an American actress in theater, television, and movies with a career spanning 55 years. She was born in Philadelphia. She studied first at Bennett Junior College and then in London at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She began her professional acting appearance with the Stratford-on-Avon Shakespearean Company before moving back to the United States. Her Shakespearean roles included Ophelia in Hamlet and the Queen in Richard II. Her film credits include Butterfield 8 (1960), A Rage to Live (1965), Rabbit, Run (1970), Sounder (1972), Top of the Hill (1980) and Daniel (1983). Matthews also appeared in six episodes of the 1955-65 Alfred Hitchcock Presents TV series , as well as the 1963 TV series The Fugitive. One of her more famous roles was that of Col. Lilian Rayborn on Episode 150 of M*A*S*H. Her last role was in the Last Best Year (1990) with Mary Tyler Moore and Bernadette Peters. In 1975, Mathews set up and ran a residential summer camp for disadvantaged children on her 100-acre farm in Redding, Connecticut. Toward the end her of life, Mathews, a passionate environmentalist, made a perpetual donation of her 100-acre New Pond Farm to the Redding Land Trust, to ensure that it would retain its woods, fields, pond and marsh. Because of her philanthropic activities in education, the United Nations Association of the United States of America named her one of Connecticut's outstanding women in 1987."

The Miami New Times describes his work as something which \"stays in your head all day long, popping in your subconscious, arousing you when you least expect. It's porn for intellectuals.\" Cumingham's work, often a collaborative effort with ideas coming directly from the performers themselves and conveyed in unscripted short videos, usually created in single takes, is driven by the intensity of their own erotic desires."

  "text" : "Charles de Solier, comte de Morette (1480 – 1 February 1552), the son of Aubertin de Solier, comte de Morette (1465–1545), was a French soldier and diplomat as well as a long-serving gentilhomme de la chambre to Francis I. He acted as ambassador to England on a number of occasions from October 1526 to June 1535. Morette was in London in 1534 when Henry VIII was attempting to win French support for his repudiation of Catherine of Aragon, in an alliance against Charles V. Around this time, his portrait was painted by Hans Holbein the Younger. Holbein had also painted The Ambassadors, which depicted two French envoys, Jean de Dinteville, seigneur de Polisy and Georges de Selve, Bishop of Lavaur in 1533. He was succeeded as ambassador by Antoine de Castelnau, Bishop of Tarbes."

Cesarini also served as the maestro di capella in several Roman churches, including the Chiesa del Gesù from 1704. He composed numerous oratorios and cantatas and was the joint composer of several operas. The opera Clearco in Negroponte which he composed with Giovanni Lorenzo Lulier and Tommaso Gaffi inaugurated the public opening of the Teatro Capranica on 18 January 1695. The last known records of him date from early September 1741 and document his retirement as the maestro di capella of the Chiesa del Gesù due to ill health. Several individual pieces of his vocal music were published in the 20th century."

  "text" : "Cayetano Corona Gaspariano is a Mexican potter from San Pablo del Monte, Tlaxcala, who is the only authenticated producer of Talavera ceramics in the state. He left his home state at age thirteen to learn the craft in Puebla, working for years at the Uriarte workshop. In 1981, he decided to return to San Pablo del Monte, founding his own workshop with his sons. This eventually grew into the current La Corona enterprise. The workshop produces bowls, large covered vases called tibores, flowerpots, jars, platter and more. Tiles are also made, including those which are assembled to create murals, especially with country scenes and religious imagery. The pieces are made with two types of clay, a black sandy type and a rose-colored clay, both bought in bulk in Puebla. The clays are blended, wet and left to ferment before pieces are shaped, usually with molds. Then pieces are set to dry in an unventilated room, which can take up to a month. The unglazed pieces are fired, the coated in a white glaze made with tin and lead. The designs painted on with mineral pigments limited to the traditional colors of Talavera ceramics: blue, yellow, red, green, black and white. Because of its certification, the Corona family can sell its ware in upscale markets in Mexico such as Liverpool. They also export to Canada, the United States, Denmark and Japan. In 2001, Corona Gaspariano was named a “grand master” by the Fomento Cultural Banamex . La Corona and other workshops run by the family received a visit from the state governor in 2012."

  "text" : "Clifford Stanley Kwan-Gett is an Australian-born Chinese American engineer, physician, and artificial heart pioneer. Kwan-Gett was born as Clifford Gett in 1934 in Emmaville, New South Wales, a small tin mining town in the Australian bush. His father Walter Gett owned the Yow Sing & Co. General Store in Emmaville. Kwan-Gett was the eighth of ten children and the first in his family to attend college. At the University of Sydney, while a resident in Wesley College, he obtained degrees in Science and Engineering and later in Medicine. He married Joo Een Tan, then adopted his Chinese family name by changing his surname from Gett to Kwan-Gett. In 1966 Kwan-Gett went to the Cleveland Clinic to do artificial heart research as a fellow with Dr. Yuki Nose. In 1967 Kwan-Gett moved to Salt Lake City, Utah with Dr. Willem J. Kolff to establish a new Division of Artificial Organs at the University of Utah. During his tenure as director of engineering and the sole surgeon with the artificial heart program at the University of Utah from 1967 to 1971, Kwan-Gett invented a pneumatically powered total artificial heart system. An important advance of this system was the ability to mimic \"Starling's Law,\" which describes the natural heart's ability to vary the blood volume of each beat depending on the pressures in the upper chambers of the heart. Kwan-Gett's system was the first to use completely passive filling of the artificial heart's ventricles in a way that automatically balanced blood flow between the left and right ventricles without using complex control systems. Another innovation of the Kwan-Gett heart was the use of hemispherical non-distensible pumping diaphragms that did not crush red blood cells against the walls of the heart. In 1971 Kwan-Gett left full-time research to pursue fellowship and residency training at the University of Utah. He became board certified in both thoracic surgery and general surgery. Kwan-Gett practiced cardiovascular thoracic surgery in Salt Lake City and remained active in the artificial organs research community there. He retired in 1995 and moved to San Diego, where he now lives."

  "text" : "Chen Guangbiao (Chinese: 陈光标; born July 1968) is a Chinese recycling entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is the founder and chairman of Jiangsu Huangpu Renewable Resources Limited Company and was reportedly worth US$810 million in 2013, according to the rankings of the Chinese wealth research firm, Hurun Report; although, Forbes estimated his wealth at US$400 million in January 2014, while the Associated Press published an estimate of US$750 million in June 2014. Chen became well known in China for personally rescuing 13 people as part of a broader involvement in the rescue effort following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Forbes Asia chose him as one of the 48 leading philanthropists of the Asia Pacific Region in both 2008 and 2009. Chen appeared in international headlines due to his high-profile, but unsuccessful, attempt to buy The New York Times in January 2014. Chen is also known for his publicity stunts and admitted in a January 2014 Wall Street Journal article that they are part of his persona. Domestically, his philanthropy has been questioned by several news sources."

Ferguson was married to William Chisholm, who was a smith, armourer and standard bearer for the chief of Clan Chisholm. Chisholm was killed at the Battle of Culloden.

  "text" : "Chao Sze-Tsung Cecil (Chinese: 趙世曾, born 1936) is a Hong Kong billionaire who is the owner of Cheuk Nang Holdings Ltd. He is widely noted for his claim to have slept with 10,000 women. He had children by three of them: actresses Kelly Yao Wei (mother of Gigi, below) and Ying Ying, and model Terri Holladay. In 2012 Chao gained international attention when he offered $65 million to any man who could convince his lesbian daughter, Gigi, to marry her. Despite criticism, Cecil Chao remains unrepentant. In 2014 Cecil Chao increased his offer to $80 million to the man who would marry his daughter. Gigi responded publicly in an open letter printed in the South China Morning Post. They note that despite Gigi marrying her partner of nine years, Sean Eav, in a civil ceremony in France in 2012, her father still considers her single. She wrote, in part, \"With Sean, a woman, I am comfortable and satisfied with my life … I know it's difficult for you to understand how I could feel romantically attracted to a woman; I suppose I can't really explain it either. It just happens, peacefully and gently, and after so many years, we still love each other very much. My regret is that you have no idea how happy I am with my life, and there are aspects of my life that you don't share. I suppose we don't need each other's approval for our romantic relationships, and I am sure your relationships are really fantastic too. Now, I'm not asking you to be best of friends; however, it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her, and treat her like a normal, dignified human being.\""

With this win, at age 14, Kim became the youngest gold medalist until she lost this record to Kelly Sildaru who won gold in 2016 at the age of 13. In the 2016 X Games, she became the first person under the age of 16 to win three gold medals (and thus the first such person to win back-to-back gold medals) at an X Games. Also in 2016, at the U.S. Snowboarding Grand Prix, she became the first woman to land back-to-back 1080 spins in a snowboarding competition. Also in 2016, she became the first American woman to win a gold medal in snowboarding at the Winter Youth Olympic Games, and earned the highest snowboarding score in Youth Olympic Games history at the time. She was selected as Team USA’s flag bearer for the Opening Ceremony of the 2016 Winter Youth Olympic Games, thus becoming the first snowboarder chosen to serve as flag bearer for Team USA at either the Olympic Winter Games or Youth Olympic Games. Kim was nominated for the 2016 ESPYS award for Best Breakthrough Athlete"

  "text" : "James Colin Ross Welch (23 April 1924 – 28 January 1997) was a British political journalist. According to Richard West in his obituary of Welch, he was a \"strong and eloquent advocate of individual liberty against the power of government\", Welch was born at Ickleton Abbey in Cambridgeshire and was educated at Stowe and Peterhouse Cambridge. He joined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1944, took part in the Normandy landings in June and fought until injured in March 1945. He joined the Glasgow Herald in 1948, and then Daily Telegraph in 1950, when he became a parliamentary correspondent for the newspaper, advocating his economic liberal views for three decades. He was appointed Deputy Editor of the newspaper in 1964, serving until 1980. He died in January 1997 in Froxfield, Wiltshire. He was known for being one of the harshest critics of Enid Blyton in the 1950s and 1960s, especially her Noddy series, which he believed was having a negative impact on child development in post-war Britain. In 1958 he published a scathing article in Encounter in which he remarked that it was \"hard to see how a diet of Miss Blyton could help with the 11-plus or even with the Cambridge English Tripos\", describing Noddy as an \"unnaturally priggish ... sanctimonious...witless, spiritless, snivelling, sneaking doll.\" His granddaughter, by his son Nicholas Russell Welch, an advertising executive, is musician Florence Welch."

He was born in Wales, made the tour of Europe, and, after the experience of both kinds of fortune, died in 1732.\" Dr Richard Wilkes wrote of him: \"Exalted soul! Thy various sounds could please / The love-sick virgin, and the gouty ease,Could jarring crowds like old Amphion, move / To beauteous order and harmonious love./ Rest here in Peace, till angels bud these rise. /And meet thy Saviour's consort in the skies\". According to Boswell's Life of Johnson, the actor David Garrick recited Wilkes's poem to Dr Johnson, who then wrote his own “An Epitaph on Claudy Phillips, Musician” (1740): \"Philips, whose touch harmonious could remove / The pangs of guilty power or hapless love; / Rest here, distressed by poverty no more. /Here find that calm thou gav'st so oft before; /Sleep, undisturbed, within this peaceful shrine, / Till angels wake thee with a note like thine\". David Garrick also wrote an “Epitaph on Claudy Philips.” Philips, who was a friend of the deaf clairvoyant Duncan Campbell, could speak sign language. Campbell says of him that he lodged at Claudy's mother's house, and that he \"loved me all his Life\""

She works in printmaking, painting, installation and film, and was part of the Black British Art movement of the 1980s. She draws on fine and pop art imagery in works that explore Asian femininity and her personal family history, merging Bollywood bling with childhood memories.

  "text" : "Clare Rojas (born 1976) is an internationally shown artist, currently based in San Francisco and is considered to be part of the Mission School. She is \"known for creating powerful folk-art-inspired tableaus that tackle traditional gender roles.\" She works in a variety of media, including painting, installations, video, street art, and children's books. She received her MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and previously attended the Rhode Island School of Design. Rojas also plays guitar and banjo under the stage name Peggy Honeywell. As Peggy Honeywell, she wore a long wig and flouncy calico dresses, and sometimes, because she was shy, a paper bag over her head. She has released two albums: Faint Humms (2005) and Green Mountain (2006) In her more recent work, Rojas has moved from figurative paintings into pure geometric abstraction. Referencing West Coast modernism, Quaker art, Native American textiles, Byzantine mosaics, and Outsider art, Rojas tells stories through painting, installations, and video. Often her narratives concern relationships between the sexes and among humans and animals, in their struggle to find harmony and balance. Many works quietly celebrate the traditional strengths of women, depicting them like Russian nesting dolls in conventional roles without critical undertones or hints of sexual exploitation. Quilt-like patterns in vivid colors accentuate the folk art-inspired scenes present in some works, while simple geometric forms and stark interiors evoke Bauhaus design in others. Recently, Rojas has focused her attention on the abstract shapes formed by architecture and shadow that dominate interior spaces, producing colorful, precise, abstract compositions on stretched linen. Unlike many of her contemporaries, Rojas explores the traditional and often subordinate roles of women without sexual exploitation or overt eroticism, making her works both poignant and enjoyable. Melding craft and fine art with unparalleled verve, Rojas produces witty work that is part Bauhaus, part Bonanza. The May, 2001, installing “East Meets West”—three West Coast artists and their East Coast counterparts—at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia was a milestone for Rojas. It was her first museum show and it placed her in a context with an artist that to some extent she’d been modelling herself on. Rojas’s favorite paper is a thick white Bristol card stock. Rojas married fellow artist Barry McGee in 2005. She adopted his daughter, Asha, from his previous marriage to Margaret Kilgallen. Kilgallen was a large influence on Rojas's work. Rojas did her best to honor Kilgallen and her work even after Kilgallen's death in 2001."

  "text" : "Carl Adolf Georg Lauterbach (21 April 1864, Breslau – 1 September 1937, Breslau) was a German explorer and botanist. He studied natural sciences and agriculture at the Universities of Breslau and Heidelberg, obtaining his doctorate at the latter institution in 1888. Within the next twelve years he participated in three exploratory expeditions (1889, 1896 and 1899–1900) to Kaiser-Wilhelmsland (part of German New Guinea). On the two later expeditions, he explored the Bismarck Mountains, located in the island's interior. On the third mission (1899-1900) he was made director of the Neu-Guinea Compagnie. Some of the specimens that he collected were further examined by Viktor Ferdinand Brotherus and Paul Christoph Hennings. At his estate in Stabelwitz, outside of Breslau (part of Breslau since 1928), he maintained an impressive plant nursery and arboretum. He is commemorated with the genera Lauterbachia (family Monimiaceae) and Lauterbachiella (family Parmulariaceae). The genus Gertrudia (family Flacourtiaceae) was named after Lauterbach's wife, Gertrud Fuchs-Henel, a noted botanical illustrator. In 1897 Anton Reichenow named the yellow-breasted bowerbird (Chlamydera lauterbachi) in his honor."

  "text" : "Charles Allen Cary (1861-1935) was born and educated in Iowa. He received the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Iowa State University in 1887. He did graduate work at the University of Missouri and in Germany. In 1892, Dr. Cary taught the first veterinary science course at the Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College, now Auburn University. In 1893, he was appointed professor of physiology and veterinary science, as well as experiment station veterinarian. In both capacities, he was remembered as a dynamic teacher. He became Alabama's first State Veterinarian in 1905, during which time he led in establishing meat and dairy inspection laws. In 1907, he was named Dean of the new College of Veterinary Medicine at Auburn, the first such school in the South. He held that position until his death in 1935. Dr. Cary was President of the Alabama Veterinary Association, the Alabama Livestock Association, and the United States Livestock Sanitary Association. His campaigns to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and Texas tick fever were among the many accomplishments that led to his recognition as the Father of Veterinary Medicine in the South. In 1957, he was elected to the Alabama Hall of Fame. At the first Charles Allen Cary Lecture given at Auburn University's College of Veterinary Medicine, January 27, 1992, Dr. Charles W. Schwabe from the University of California at Davis, said: \"I can think of no other veterinarian who more profoundly influenced through his professional lifetime, the health and well being of a whole region of this country than Charles Allen Cary.\" Charles Allen Cary was inducted into the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame in 1992. Cary is best known for his fight to rid Alabama livestock of fever ticks. Brucellosis and tuberculosis testing were furthered by his research and practical applications. When farmers sought hog cholera serum at low prices, Cary used his influence to establish a plant at Auburn to make it. His Saturday clinics and summer institutes taught farmers about the prevention and treatment of diseases of animals. In 1896 he helped to establish at Montgomery the first meat inspection system in the United States, following that up with meat and milk inspection ordinances in all major Alabama cities. Through his efforts the first school of veterinary science in the South was established at Auburn and he served as dean of that school for 28 years. The veterinary science building on the campus now bears his name."

  "text" : "Christopher Michael Graham Kennedy is an artist who was born and raised in the UK. Kennedy spent many years as a music editor, working on over 50 Hollywood feature films in Los Angeles, California. He was nominated for one Emmy Award in 2009, for music editing on The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler, and three Golden Reel Sound Awards for “Unfaithful,” “De-Lovely” and “Rameses”, and has collaborated with Jan AP Kaczmarek, composer of the Oscar-winning score for Finding Neverland. Kennedy moved to Bucks County Pennsylvania in 2002 to concentrate on fine art photography. He developed a technique which he calls Photo Luminism. Images are created entirely in-camera in a single exposure and with no creative post additions. The abstracted images are hot-printed onto specially treated metal, a process that maximises the appearance of light emanating from within the image, on an entirely flat and mirror-like surface.Photo Luminism is a term which references the Luminism movement of painting, to which Kennedy has family ties. He has adapted some of the principles of Luminism into a photographic-based contemporary idiom- particularly in his focus on the effects of light and a smoothing of surface."

He moved to the Brown Institution in London to conduct research in the physiological aspects of pleuro-pneumonia. During the Turko-Serbian war of 1876 he was in charge of a hospital at Janina in Turkey. After the war he went to Berlin to study under Emil du Bois-Reymond and Rudolf Virchow working on aspects of heart physiology. He obtained an M.D. from Edinburgh with a gold medal. He was invited to the Strasburg Physiological Institute where he worked on blood circulation before moving to Leipzig in 1879. In 1880 he moved to Cambridge as George Henry Lewes student, working in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Foster. He taught advanced physiology to students. He succeeded Dr W.S. Greenfield as the director of Brown Institution. In 1884 he was elected professor of pathology at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of the Royal Society. He worked with others at the Pathological Laboratory such as Charles Scott Sherrington and several students became eminent pathologists including Ernest Hanbury Hankin, John George Adami and James Lorrain Smith.

Moore received his B.Sc. from Ohio State University (1901) and then his A.M. (1902) and Ph.D. (1904) from Cornell University. His doctoral dissertation was entitled Classification of the surfaces of singularities of the quadratic spherical complex with Virgil Snyder as thesis advisor. Moore also studied geometry in Göttingen, Turin with Corrado Segre, and Bonn with Eduard Study. In 1904 Moore joined the MIT mathematics department as an instructor and was successively promoted to assistant professor, associate professor, and full professor. In 1920 he was one of the founders of the MIT Journal of Mathematics and Physics. He remained at MIT until his death in 1931 following a surgical operation."

  "text" : "Henry Colin Strang (10 August 1910 – 28 November 1946) was an Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Strang, the son of former South Melbourne player Bill Strang, was born in Sydney, but grew up in Albury. He played his early football for East Albury and in 1933 trained with Richmond, where his brothers Doug and Gordon were premiership players. A younger brother, Alan Strang played for South Melbourne. However it was with St Kilda that he made his two league appearances, in the 1933 VFL season. He kicked three goals from full-forward on debut, against Carlton at Junction Oval, in round seven. The following round he played in St Kilda's loss to Collingwood at Victoria Park, then lost his place in the team when Bill Mohr returned from injury. He returned home in 1935 and began playing for Albury, which was followed by a stint with Kyneton in the Bendigo Football League. In 1937 he joined Northern Tasmanian Football Association side North Launceston, a club captain-coached by his brother Gordon. They lost the grand final that year to Launceston, after which Strang returned to Albury. On 28 November 1946, Strang died from an illness, aged only 36. Two of his nephews were in Richmond's 1967 premiership team: Geoff Strang, the son of his brother, Doug, and John Perry, the son of his sister, Edna \"Bob\" Perry, née Strang."

  "text" : "Charles Francis Keary (1848–1917) was born in Stoke-on-Trent, England, and he became a scholar and historian. In his later work as a novelist he also influenced the modernist writer James Joyce. Charles was born to a Galway Irish family which had settled in the industrial Midlands borough of Stoke-on-Trent. He was the son of William Keary, who in 1874 would become the first mayor of Stoke-on-Trent. The young Charles was schooled at Marlborough College and then took his degree at Trinity College, Cambridge. He became fascinated by Scandinavian history and primitive mythology, then a promising new academic field, and wrote a number of scholarly books on such topics. His book The Vikings in Western Christendom (1890) stood as a standard work for many decades. He also became expert on Norway and the Norwegians, and knew many poets and writers there. Keary worked for many years at the Department of Coins at The British Museum in London, where he wrote and published A Catalogue Of English Coins In The British Museum: Anglo-Saxon Series (1887) with Herbert Appold Grueber, and contributed scholarly articles on coins to numismatic journals. Keary was awarded the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1894. During his time at the British Museum he was the best friend of Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, the Anglo-Irish philosopher. Keary then turned from coins and history to writing ambitious literary novels, influenced by the Russian novelists of the time. These works were rather unusual, using a lack of conventional structure in an attempt to suggest the chaos of reality, allied to close observation and a dispassionate approach to character. His novel Herbert Vanlennart (1896) was based on his tour of India, which he had also written up in the short travel book India: Impressions (1903). His later novel Bloomsbury (1905) drew on his experience of moving amid the \"curious neurotic intellectualism\" (The Spectator review, 8 April 1905) of London literary circles in the Bloomsbury of the late 1880s and early 1890s. At that time, under the pseudonym H. Ogram Matuce, he had published a radically impressionistic prose work titled The Wanderer: From the papers of the late H. Ogram Matuce (1888). In a Spectator review (4 September 1909, of his later novel The Mount) the reviewer remembered that: \"For some of us the publication of Mr. C. F. Keary's The Wanderer over twenty years ago was an event\". Keary tried the then-fashionable form of verse drama, with \"The Brothers: a Fairy Masque\" (1902) and \"Rigel: a Mystery\" (1904), and moved with more success into philosophy with his The Pursuit of Reason (Cambridge University Press, 1910). After his untimely death, from a heart attack, one further book appeared: The Posthumous Poems of C. F. Keary (1923). But the unfortunate timing of his death, coming amid the full clamour of World War One, hastened his rapid slide into almost total obscurity. His book collection of short works in the weird macabre, Twixt Dog and Wolf (1901), is known to have influenced James Joyce's novel Dubliners (1905) – as evidenced in a letter from Joyce dated 24 September 1905 (Letters of James Joyce, Vol. 2, p. 111). Keary also wrote the libretto for the opera Koanga (1904) by the composer Frederick Delius, with whom he had detailed discussions. But the collaboration was short and fraught, and it led to no further work with Delius. (See: John White, \"The Literary Sources of the Delius Operas\", Delius Society Journal, Summer 2004, pp. 16–18). Keary's sister was the Staffordshire folklorist and folk-song collector Miss Alice Annie Keary, close friend of the major folklorist Charlotte Sophia Burne. Keary himself travelled in Europe and dabbled there in folk-song collecting, publishing articles such as \"Roumanian Peasants and their Songs\"."

  "text" : "Charles Selby (c. 1802 – 1863) was a 19th-century English actor and playwright, and translator of many French plays (often without attribution, not uncommon at the time). Among his works was The Marble Heart (1854), a translation of Théodore Barrière's Les Filles de marbre. The play is best known today for a 9 November 1863 performance in Washington, D.C., where President Abraham Lincoln watched John Wilkes Booth, playing the villain Raphael. Booth directed some of his threatening lines directly to Lincoln, causing one of Lincoln's party to remark \"he looks as if he meant that for you.\" Lincoln agreed, noting \"he does look pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?\" Selby died at his home in Covent Garden, London, on 21 March 1863 and buried at Kensal Green Cemetery."

  "text" : "Cornealious Michael \"Mike\" Anderson III (born c. 1977) was convicted of armed robbery in 2000 and sentenced to 13 years in the Missouri state prison system. Shortly after his conviction he was released on bail pending the outcome of an appeal of his conviction. In May 2002, his appeal was rejected but, due to a clerical error, his bond was not revoked when a warrant was issued for his arrest. It was unclear why he was not arrested and imprisoned to serve his 13-year sentence, but, apparently due to clerical errors and miscommunication, the Missouri Department of Corrections thought he was already in prison. The error was only discovered when he was scheduled to be released from prison in 2013. On July 25, 2013 he was arrested and required to serve his 13-year sentence. The case stirred controversy when investigative articles were written by Jessica Lussenhop in the Riverfront Times newspaper and when his case was covered nationally in the United States in an episode of This American Life. By April 2014, his case began receiving extensive national and international attention. These articles and episode raised the question of whether he should be returned to prison 13 years after his conviction especially since the victim of his crime did not believe he should be in prison. Anderson's attorney filed several appeals and petitions for his release from prison, and on May 5, 2014 Anderson was released from prison. In 2014, he was arrested for another crime, but subsequent videotape evidence showed that he could not have committed the crime and charges were dropped with an apology by Circuit Attorney Jennifer M. Joyce."

Costache Conachi is regarded by some as the first true Romanian poet of his time. He is credited with infusing eroticism into Romanian poetry. Although he lived and worked in an era of Romanian literature that is hazy at best, his name is not easily forgotten. Coming from a wealthy family Conachi had access to readings on foreign cultures and the works of great authors. This foundation of knowledge shaped his poems. It resulted in verses in Romanian marked with unprecedented elements such as eroticism."

Her early work developed Bertolt Brecht's modernist dramatic and theatrical techniques of Epic theatre to explore issues of gender and sexuality. From A Mouthful of Birds (1986) onwards, she began to experiment with forms of dance-theatre, incorporating techniques developed from the performance tradition initiated by Antonin Artaud with his 'Theatre of Cruelty'. This move away from a clear Fabel dramaturgy towards increasingly fragmented and surrealistic narratives characterises her work as postmodernist."

  "text" : "Cyril Lionel Robert James (4 January 1901 – 31 May 1989), who sometimes wrote under the pen-name J. R. Johnson, was an Afro-Trinidadian historian, journalist and socialist. His works are influential in various theoretical, social, and historiographical contexts. His work is a staple of subaltern studies, and he figures as a pioneering and influential voice in postcolonial literature. A tireless political activist, James's writing on the Communist International stirred debate in Trotskyist circles, and his history of the Haitian Revolution, The Black Jacobins, is a seminal text in the literature of the African Diaspora. Characterised by one literary critic as an \"anti-Stalinist dialectician\", James was known for his autodidactism, for his occasional playwriting and fiction — his 1936 book Minty Alley was the first novel by a black West Indian to be published in Britain — and as an avid sportsman. He is also famed as a writer on cricket, and his 1963 book, Beyond a Boundary, which he himself described as \"neither cricket reminiscences nor autobiography\", is often named as the best single book on any sport, ever written."

The son of James Rose, Bishop of Fife, and Euphemia Campbell, Charles was possibly educated at the University of St Andrews. Following his ordination at Dunkeld on 17 May 1745, he served as the chaplain to Lord Arbuthnott from 1745 to 1756. He was then appointed the Incumbent of Doune in 1756, a post he retained until his death. He became the Bishop of Dunblane in 1774 and was consecrated at Forfar on 24 August 1774 by bishops Falconer, Rait and Forbes. Four years later, he also became the Bishop of Dunkeld from 11 June 1776 until autumn 1786. He successfully blocked the consecration of William Abernethy Drummond to the See of Brechin in 1781, and opposed the consecration of Samuel Seabury in 1784. After the other bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church abandoned their allegiance to the House of Stuart and recognised the House of Hanover in 1788, he irregularly consecrated James Brown to continue the non-juring succession. Bishop Rose died in office in April 1791."

  "text" : "Clarence Schmidt (September 11, 1897 in Queens, New York – November 9, 1978 in Woodstock, New York) was locally and nationally renowned “outsider artist” — an iconic pioneer of monumental environmental sculpture. His ongoing life’s work, the “Miracle on the Mountain,” was constructed of found objects and recycled materials between the years 1940-1972, which evolved on the back slope of Ohayo Mountain, in Woodstock NY. Clarence Schmidt attended high school in Astoria Queens, NY, before dropping out to work alongside his father as a mason and plasterer. One account mentions him building sets for silent films — a potent metaphor for what was to come. In 1920 Schmidt inherited five acres of land off Ohayo Mountain, near Woodstock NY; around 1928 he convinced his wife Grace to summer with him there. The couple alternated living in NYC and Woodstock through the 1920s and '30s, and finally settled in Woodstock in the late 1930s when Schmidt finished his first house there, built in a “Swiss Family Robinson,” style. Beginning with a cabin made of railroad ties, the building was rough, but solid and conventional enough to sell. Schmidt called the place, “Journey’s End\". Around 1940 Schmidt cleared another corridor down Ohayo and built a cabin for his own use at its base. It was here, that additional rooms, terraces, caves, gardens, grottos, a pool, shrines and further wings were stacked upon one another, advancing up the mountain’s face, demanding continuous expansion, until a seven story extension hung off the backside of Ohayo. In Jan 1968, the structure, which was largely held together with a type of roofing tar, caught fire, and burned almost entirely. At first thought to have, himself, become victim of the fire, Schmidt was found days later sleeping in a doorway in the village. Put up in a local rooming house (The Shady Townhouse, in Shady a hamlet of Woodstock) for the winter, he recuperated until the warmer season.After the first fire which decimated his “Garden of Hope” he was quoted, in the Woodstock Week thus: “I’ve suffered Dante’s Inferno and every other thing...but I’ll get back up there sooner than you think...I’m doing a lot of writing now. I’m creating a Bible, and it’s based on genetic religion.” About that time, he separated from his wife, who continued to live in the area.For the first half of that period she’d been an eccentric beauty transplanted during the Depression from her native Queens to a dwelling built by her even more eccentric husband and cousin. Soon after, Schmidt commenced building another abode that became a large treehouse with many architectural and artistic embellishments. Amid legal disputes over property boundaries, alleged precarious mental health of his son, bickering with his estranged wife and neighbor, and ever-mounting fame Schmidt continued his work. He was quoted as saying “Don’t forget there were a good many years when I had to hold a flashlight in my mouth to see what I was doing, when night came upon me. I was afraid of dying before I could get the house done.”In 1972 the treehouse also caught on fire, while he was sleeping in it, likely caused by the makeshift heating and lighting he implemented. Schmidt was badly burned, hospitalized, and never fully recovered. He became a Medicaid patient at Hadley’s Nursing Home on Albany Avenue in Kingston.For five years, he'd spend most of the day waving at hundreds and thousands of passers by.In 1976 the nursing home was cited for state codes violations and half of their residents were farmed out. Schmidt protested his transfer, but was resettled in Greene County Nursing Home. However, he soon warmed to the place. Two years later, on November 9, 1978, he died there, of heart failure. Schmidt was sent off to Greenburgh for cremation, his ashes then delivered to Lasher Funeral Home, in Woodstock. His ashes were lost, but then rediscovered in Sept. 2010, when his wife was cremated. A true eccentric, Schmidt compared himself to Rip Van Winkle, Paul Bunyan, Robin Hood, and Baron Munchausen; \"I became some greater part of this mountain up here. Why when I walked along the road, the trees knelt down on my behalf. . . .There I was — in the land of ecstasy!\""

According to Bill Conlin, she had a 33% stake in the team in 2007, making her the largest stakeholder of the ownership group. She was part of the cabal of Phillies owners known as the \"Phantom Five\", so-called because of their reclusiveness and lack of involvement in Phillies affairs. The Betz family made its fortunes in Betz Laboratories, a water treatment company based in Pennsylvania. The Phillies honored Betz with the wearing of a \"CB\" memorial patch on their uniforms during the 2014 season."

  "text" : "Cormac Antram (May 18, 1926 – October 1, 2013), born James Antram and known as Father Cormac, was a Catholic priest and member of the Franciscan order who became known for his work on the Navajo Nation and with the Navajo language. Born in Roswell, New Mexico, Antram became a Franciscan in 1945, studied at Duns Scotus College in Southfield, Michigan from 1946 to 1950, and was ordained a priest in 1954. He was assigned to St. Michael's Mission in St. Michaels, Arizona and spent his career at institutions around the Navajo Nation, including in Chinle, Houck, and Kayenta, Arizona, and in Gallup and Tohatchi, New Mexico. Antram learned to speak Navajo fluently, and in 1958 began a bilingual radio program, known as \"The Padre's Hour\" (although the programs were actually only a half-hour in length) that became widely popular among the Navajo. He continued to host the show for more than 45 years (except for an 18-month stint by another priest in the 1960s), making it one of the longest-running programs in American radio history. He also supervised a 20-year effort to produce an authorized translation of the Catholic Mass into Navajo, and became known as an expert on the language, sometimes consulted by native speakers with questions about the language. He adapted other Catholic prayers into Navajo, including a version of the Gloria Patri (\"Glory be to the Father\") prayer, sung to a melody associated with the traditional Navajo Blessing Way chant. He died in 2013 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, aged 87. He was reported to be the last Franciscan priest who could speak the Navajo Language fluently. In 2011, his celebration of the Navajo Mass was recorded on video to preserve it for future use. He also authored two books collecting columns and stories from his column in the diocese newspaper."

  "text" : "Carlo da Camerino was the name given by an Italian art historian to identify an Italian painter who was presumed to have been active in the Marche region around the turn of the 15th century. A painted Crucifix, signed and dated in 1396, made for the church of San Michele Arcangelo in Macerata Feltria was attributed to this artist as well as other works in the Marche region. Research published in 2002 made clear that the name 'Carlo da Camerino' was based on a misreading of the inscription on the Crucifix in the church of San Michele Arcangelo, which reads as follows: ALV......DECI..CARELLU DA CAMERINO PIN... The art historian Cesare Brandi interpreted in 1935 the inscription as the signature of its author: ................CAROLLU DA CAMERINO PINXIT From that moment the hypothesis of the existence of a painter of the Marche region by the name Carlo da Camerino was formed and subsequently many works were attributed to this artist including a Madonna with Child in Mondavio, dating from the year 1400. In 2002, on the occasion of an exhibition on the Quattrocento in Camerino, the art historian Matteo Mazzalupi re-interpreted the inscription as: ALVUCCIU DE CICCARELLU DA CAMERINO PINXIT thus assigning the painting to Olivuccio di Ciccarello of Camerino. As a result, in 2002, all works attributed formerly to Carlo da Camerino have been re-attributed to the artist Olivuccio di Ciccarello, an artist of Camerino (in Italian: 'da Camerino'), which suggests a unanimous agreement among art historians regarding the re-interpretation and attribution."

  "text" : "Cal Bolder (June 14, 1931 – January 19, 2005) was an American film and television actor best known for his role as the outlaw turned monster in the 1966 film Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter. A native of the small Kansas city of Elkhart, Earl C. Craver was a middle child of six born to Mabel Mae and Fred Francis Craver. Young Earl graduated from Elkhart High School then attended Wichita State University on a football scholarship. He married his wife Billie in 1954 He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps for the Korean War, served in Korea and was awarded the Purple Heart. Following service with the 1st Marine Division Craver was posted to the newly reformed 9th Marines at Camp Pendleton. After leaving the Marines as a corporal, Craver became a Los Angeles motorcycle policeman. In 1959 he issued a traffic citation to Robert Raison, a Hollywood agent and a friend of fellow agent Henry Willson who arranged the two of them to meet. Impressed by Craver's 6' 4\"/193 cm height, his 260 pound/118 kg physique, his 52\"/132 cm chest and his 32\"/81 cm waist Willson interested the physically imposing Craver into an acting career. Willson, who created Rock Hudson's stage name, changed Craver's name to \"Cal Bolder\"; \"Cal\" for \"California\" and Bolder for boulder relating to his physique. Willson explained Craven's new name in his style of having a one syllable first name and two syllable last name by saying \"I try to get a name that looks like the guy...He's a big Western type guy and that sounds it\". At the same time while working as a police officer, he injured his back when lifting a small car during the course of his duties. He was subsequently reassigned to a less physically demanding job as a police despatcher within theDepartment. Three times he applied to the board of pension commissioners for a disability pension, claiming that hisback injury made it impossible for him to perform the regular duties of a police officer. Each time his application was denied by the retirement board. Craver's contention to the retirement board and then to the court was that the standard of review should be whether he could perform the usual duties of police officer, not the usual duties of the particular position to which he was assigned. Bolder first made appearances in television series such as Bonanza and Adventures in Paradise and made his film debut in Heller in Pink Tights in 1960. Bolder appeared in several other popular television series such as The Man from UNCLE where episodes with his appearances were turned into the feature films One Spy Too Many and One of Our Spies Is Missing. Bolder also played in the episode Friday's Child on Star Trek. He left the screen at the age of 36, after a 1967 appearance on Cimarron Strip and moved with his wife and children to Royal City, a small city in Washington, where he resided until his death. He was married to his wife, Billie, for over 52 years and had four children, 9 grandchildren at the time of his death. There were many other circumstances regarding the denial of his police pension that are not mentioned in this article. My Step-Father was had an unjust trail before the pension board all three times. I wanted to make sure the correct information was listed correctly for my Dad. I am his oldest Daughter."

  "text" : "Danika Lee Massey, also known as Comic Book Girl 19 or CBG19, is an internet celebrity known for her commentaries on comics, films, books, and television shows. She hosts videos on a YouTube channel. She has a degree in sequential art from the Savannah College of Art and Design. Comic Book Girl 19 became popular on the web in 2013. This followed after a five year period of working as a tattoo artist. As of October 2016, her YouTube channel had over 39 million views and over 520,000 subscribers. Some of her most popular videos are commentaries on the film Prometheus, the television series Game of Thrones, and the documentary series Epic History X-Men. Some videos delve into the background of various popular culture myths and explore special effects in movies. In 2013, she interviewed Alec Gillis of Amalgamated Dynamics, a special effects company that specializes in animatronics and prosthetic makeup. CBG19 occasionally co-presents with \"Robot\", a humanoid 50's Sci-Fi inspired Robotic character with the personality of an angry teenager, and \"Space Brain\", a floating 50's Sci-Fi inspired alien creature. The CBG19 videos are directed and edited by Tyson Wheeler whose creative partnership is referred to as \"Team 19\" or \"Team 19 Productions\". Comic Book Girl 19 has contributed reviews of various comics to DC All Access. She has also appeared on The Jace Hall Show's Lounge Live, Geek and Sundry, and Chaotic Awesome, sharing her views on pop culture and comics. She posed for the artist Daniel Dos Santos in a photo shoot for the cover of Diana Rowland's novel White Trash Zombie Apocalypse and was featured on Gizmodo for winning \"Best in Show\" for her RoboCop costume at Dragon Con. She has been featured in Variety and Cosmopolitan. She has spoken at TEDx Claremont Colleges on the value of using fictional characters for empowerment. CBG19 has said her pseudonym is connected to the 19th card of the Major Arcana of the Tarot, which is The Sun. Interviewed by HelloGiggles in 2014, Massey said that her use of the number is related to Stephen King's The Dark Tower. The number features in many of her videos in the form of a tattoo."

He is the current Chairman of the Department of Orthopedics at the University of Zürich, Switzerland. After studying medicine at the University of Berne, he was trained in orthopedic surgery in several Swiss hospitals, including the Davos Hospital and the University Hospital of Berne. He specialized in shoulder surgery at the University of Texas, San Antonio in 1984 and subsequently trained on tumor foot and ankle surgery as well as pediatric orthopedics in Paris in 1985. From 1985 to 1991 he served as a consultant at the Department of Orthopedics at the University of Berne, where in 1991 he was promoted to associate professor in orthopedic surgery. In 1992, he was appointed chief of the Department of Orthopedics in Fribourg and since 1995 he has worked in the Balgrist University Hospital in Zürich, where he holds the position of medical director and Chairman of the Department of Orthopedics. Christian Gerber created the RESORTHO foundation for research and education in musculoskeletal disorders to support the academic development of residents and junior staff. He also founded the international Harvard–Balgrist shoulder fellowship. He also established the Balgrist Campus, a privately funded musculoskeletal research and development institution based in Zürich. Beside his continuous clinical activity, he has also described novel surgical procedures such as the Latisimus dorsi transfer for a pseudoparalytic shoulder and he has described several important pathologies, such as the isolated rupture of the subscapularis tendon. As a result of his clinical experience, he developed clinical tests, such as the Gerber Lift Off test for a subscapular insufficiency. He is author of >300 scientific articles that were cited over 15000 times (as per Feb. 2014). He has received many awards for his clinical and research work including the Neer Award  of the American Shoulder And Elbow Surgeons (ASES) on four occasions.

  "text" : "Carlos de Almeida Fonseca Sampaio Garrido (5 April 1883 – April 1960) was a Portuguese diplomat credited with saving the lives of approximately 1,000 Jews in Nazi-occupied Hungary while serving as Portugal’s ambassador in Budapest between July and December 1944. He served as Minister Plenipotentiary and acting Ambassador of Portugal in Budapest from 1939-44. Along with Teixeira Branquinho, (Portuguese Chargé d'Affaires in Budapest in 1944) Garrido rented houses and apartments to shelter and protect refugees from deportation and murder. They obtained permission from the Portuguese government to issue safe conduct passes to all persons who had relatives in Portugal, Brazil, or the Portuguese colonies or had a connection to Portugal. Garrido and Branquinho also established an office of the Portuguese Red Cross at the Portuguese legation to care for Jewish refugees. This was largely done in cooperation with the Portuguese Foreign Office and under Salazar’s direct supervision with the provision that these refugees would not try to get Portuguese citizenship. On 23 April 1944 and following the German occupation of Hungary, the Portuguese ruler Salazar decided to order his ambassador to return to Lisbon and leave the chargé d'affaires, Teixeira Branquinho in his place. This recall was done in response to a request from Britain and the United States who wanted neutral countries to downgrade their diplomatic presence in Hungary. Five days later, on 28 April 1944, at 5 a.m., the Hungarian political police raided the Ambassador's home arresting his guests. The Ambassador physically resisted the police and was also arrested but managed to have his guests released by invoking the extraterritorial legal rights of diplomatic legations. Five of the guests were members from the famous Gabor family. Magda Gabor, Hungarian-born actress and socialite, and the elder sister of Zsa Zsa and Eva Gabor, was reported to have been the secretary, fiancée and lover of Sampaio Garrido. Zsa Zsa never forgot Magda's influential connections with rescuing her: \"For Magda's Portuguese Ambassador I thank God. It was this man who saved my life.\" Gabor's maternal grandmother and uncle Sebastian (Annette Lantos's father) chose to remain in Budapest feeling they \"had a good place to hide\". However, both died during an Allied bombing raid. In 1945 he was appointed extraordinary envoy and minister plenipotentiary to Stockholm, Sweden. In 2006 the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation honored both Sampayo Garrido and his chargé d'affaires Carlos de Liz-Texeira Branquinho. In 2010 he became the second Portuguese to be recognised as a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem; Aristides de Sousa Mendes was recognised in 1966."

In direct contact with Salazar Branquinho issued protective Passports to hundreds of Jewish families. Altogether about 1,000 lives were saved due to his actions. Branquinho was recalled to Lisbon on 30 October 1940. After the war Branquinho continued to serve his country as a diplomat, in Washington, Jakarta, Paris, Caracas, Baghdad, Teheran and the Hague, where he acted with Ambassador’s credentials.

Yellow Robe was raised in the Sicangu Lakota tradition, an honors graduate of the Carlisle Indian School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and a founding member of the Society of American Indians. He crossed cultural bridges to improve the status of American Indians, believed that the majority of Anglos were ignorant of what Indians were capable of achieving, and urged Indians to fully participate in all aspects of American life. Yellow Robe was at the forefront in the fight for American Indian citizenship during the Progressive Era, and collaborated with American Museum of Natural History to produce The Silent Enemy, the first movie and documentary with an all-Indian cast."

Willson, later the founder of Salem, Oregon, on August 16, 1840, at the Nisqually Mission. It was the first wedding of American citizens in western Washington. Willson became the first teacher of the Oregon Institute, which was founded after the failure of the Methodist mission. Willson may be best known for her diary, which chronicled her journey to Oregon on the ship Lausanne and her life as a missionary teacher, as well as her later life, and is a valuable resource for historians. In 1935, the diary was donated to Willamette University (the successor to the Oregon Institute) by her son-in-law Joseph K. Gill."

  "text" : "Christopher Wandesford, 1st Viscount Castlecomer (19 August 1656 – 15 September 1707) was an Anglo-Irish politician and peer. Wandesford was the son and heir of Sir Christopher Wandesford, 1st Baronet of Kirklington, Yorkshire, by his wife Eleanor Lowther, daughter of Sir John Lowther, 1st Baronet. He was educated at the University of Cambridge. Wandesford held the office of Member of Parliament for Ripon between 1679 and 1681. He succeeded to his father's baronetcy in February 1687. He was High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1689 and 1690. As an opponent of James II, on 7 May 1689 he was attainted in the Parliament of Ireland and had his estates seized. However, following the defeat of the Jacobite army in Ireland, he was richly rewarded by William III. He subsequently served as the MP for St Canice in Ireland between 1692 and 1706, when he was raised to the peerage. He became a member of the Privy Council of Ireland on 10 May 1695. He was elevated to the peerage when he was created Viscount Castlecomer and Baron Wandesford in the Peerage of Ireland on 15 March 1706. He died in September the following year. He married Elizabeth Montagu, the sister of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, and together they had five children. He was succeeded by his eldest son, also Christopher."

  "text" : "Claire Pentecost (born 1956, Baltimore, Maryland, United States) is an American artist, a writer, and Professor in the Department of Photography at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. Her interdisciplinary practice interrogates the imaginative and institutional structures that organize divisions of knowledge, often focusing on nature and artificiality. Her work positions artistic practice as a research practice, advocating for the role of the amateur in the collection, interpretation, and mobilization of information. Her current projects focus on industrial and bioengineered agriculture, and the hidden costs of the global corporate food system. Pentecost engages diverse strategies—collaboration, research, teaching, field work, writing, lecturing, drawing, installation and photography—in an ongoing interrogation of the institutional structures that order knowledge. According to her model, the artist is someone who consents to learn in public, interrogating knowledge itself in the cultural space of art, a place where values are contested. She promotes crossing and disturbing the disciplinary boundaries that traditionally limit the authorized specialist."

  "text" : "Charles Frederick Thackray (1877-1934) (not to be confused with the surgeon Charles Thackrah) was a pharmacist and manufacturer of surgical instruments in Leeds. Thackray began an apprenticeship in pharmacy at the Bradford firm of F. M. Rimmington & Son. He then went to work at the prestigious Squire & Son, Queen Victoria’s official chemist’s in the West End of London, and rounded off his education with a spell working on the Continent. He qualified as a pharmacist in 1899 and in 1902 opened a chemist shop in Great George Street, Leeds with his partner Henry Scurrah Wainwright. In 1903 Thackray married Helen Pearce, daughter of a leading Leeds jeweller. They lived in Roundhay, moving to bigger houses as business prospered. The company bought a sterilizer 1906 meant to develop another side to the business, supplying sterilized dressings to the Leeds General Infirmary, the nearby Women’s and Children’s Hospital and neighbouring nursing homes. The early years of the firm coincided with major advances in surgical techniques. Leeds was a centre of high-calibre surgeons, many of whom made their names at the Infirmary; best known was Berkeley Moynihan, 1st Baron Moynihan, who achieved worldwide recognition for his contribution to abdominal surgery. It was Moynihan who first suggested to Charles Thackray that he should make instruments; and the firm, with its experience in repairs at their premises just across the road, was well placed to do so. By 1914 Thackray’s was employing 25 people, including eight instrument makers and three full-time representatives. Salesmen visited customers over a wide area, supplying wholesale pharmaceuticals not only to hospitals and nursing homes but also to general practitioners serving rural areas. The War Office's acceptance of Thackray’s ‘Aseptic’ range as standard field dressings was important to the firm, both ensuring large contracts for drugs and sundries. By 1918 Thackray’s employed fourteen instrument makers, out of a total workforce of 32. In the 19302 the firm began to make its own hospital sterilizers, operating tables and other items of theatre furniture. Charles Thackray died suddenly at the age of 57 in 1934. He failed to return from an evening walk in Roundhay Park near his home and later his body was recovered from Waterloo Lake. The firm continued to prosper as a limited company and in the 1950s acquired the British Cystoscope Co Ltd, in Clerkenwell, London, and Thomas Rudd Ltd of Sheffield, makers of surgical scissors. The company was a pioneer in manufacturing replacement hips, having collaborated with the \"father\" of modern hip replacement surgery, Sir John Charnley. Thackray began manufacturing the Charnley Hip System in 1963 and it is still the best selling cemented hip system in the world. The Thackray Medical Museum, founded by his grandson Paul Thackray is situated on the outskirts of Leeds in a Victorian workhouse building adjacent to St James's University Hospital."

The Harlem-born Grimaldi and her husband were forced to change the name from Patsy's to Grimaldi's in the mid-1990s, due to a dispute with another restaurant. Eight years after the opening of the pizzeria, Grimaldi and her husband sold the pizzeria, and retired from the restaurant business. While still remaining in different business enterprises throughout the years, including Juliana's Pizzeria, the couple decided to re-open the former pizzeria business in 2011. Juliana's is located near the location of Grimaldi's, and serves modern-style pizzas. The couple was interviewed about pizza-eating techniques on NPR in 2014. As of 2014, the Grimaldi brand has become global."
