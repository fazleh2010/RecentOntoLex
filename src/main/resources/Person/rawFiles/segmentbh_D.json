  "text" : "Dom Simon Jubani (8 March 1927 – 12 July 2011) was a Catholic priest and Albanian political prisoner confined in Burrel Prison for 26 years during the regime of Enver Hoxha, where he was kept in a 12 by 24 foot cell with 30 other prisoners and beaten brutally when he refused to work in the mines. Dom Simon, brother of Dom Lazer who was poisoned in 1982, was born in Shkodër, a city in Northwestern Albania with a large Catholic population, to a devoted Catholic family and entered seminary in 1943. He was ordained in 1958 and then arrested in 1963 while serving at the Abbey of Mirëdita, a nearby province or practicing the Catholic religion. Practicing religion in Albania became illegal starting in 1967 and many religious leaders were tortured, killed, or imprisoned for practicing their faith publicly. Dom Simon wrote a memoir of his time in prison titled, \"Burgjet e mia.\" Dom Simon was released on 13 April 1989, along with other imprisoned Catholic priests. On 11 November 1990, Dom Simon Jubani was the priest to openly celebrate the first public mass since the fall of Hoxha's regime, defying the law. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of San Francisco in 1991, honored as a \"Protagonist of a new era in Albania.\" Dom Simon Jubani died of a cerebral hemorrage on 12 July 2011 at the Regional Hospital in Shkodër."

  "text" : "Dan Laksov (10 July 1940 – 25 October 2013) was a Norwegian-Swedish mathematician and human rights activist. He graduated in mathematics from the University of Bergen and took the doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was a professor of mathematics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. He also served as a director of the Mittag-Leffler Institute and editor of the institute's journal Acta Mathematica. His main contributions were in algebra, algebraic geometry and Schubert calculus. He was a fellow of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In 2008 he received an honorary degree at the University of Bergen. Laksov was born in Oslo in 1940, the same year that Norway was occupied by Nazi Germany. He was a son of Amalie Laksov, née Scheer and Håkon Laksov; the family were Jews. In the book I slik en natt. Historien om deportasjonen av jøder fra Norge by Kristian Ottosen, the escape of Amalie and Dan from Norway in November 1942 is chronicled. Håkon and Amalie's four brothers were all captured as a part of the arresting of all Norwegian Jews, shipped to Auschwitz and perished there. The family's apartment was usurped by the family of a leading Young Nazi leader, Bjørn Østring, but retrieved after the war. In 1945 Dan returned to Oslo where he lived with his grandparents, while Amalie commuted to Bergen. In 1983, Amalie Laksov created a foundation for human rights, Amalie Laksovs Minnefond. Dan Laksov was a board member here, and member of the committee that awarded the Laksov Prize for human rights. Amalie Laksov died in 2008, aged 97, while Dan Laksov died in Stockholm in October 2013."

Mr. Berry died, at the age of ninety-three, on 23 September 1889, and by his will bequeathed £100,000 to his alma mater, St. Andrews University, and a like sum to found a hospital in the Shoalhaven district of New South Wales."

  "text" : "David Bews (April 1850 – 24 February 1891) was a newspaper editor, politician in colonial South Australia and Minister of Education. Bews was born near Kirkwall, in the Orkney Islands, and went to South Australia with his parents the following year. In 1853, during the gold rush in Victoria, his family removed to that colony, but only to return one year later. Bews' father then engaged in farming operations near Port Elliot, and afterwards near Adelaide. Bews continued as a farmer till he attained his majority, when he secured a position as clerk with the Kadina & Wallaroo Railway Company. He subsequently became goods manager; but seven years later (in 1879), when the Government took over the line, he left the service, and entered the ranks of journalism by taking charge of the Wallaroo Times. He was three times mayor of the Corporate Town of Wallaroo, besides which he was a member of the late Yorke's Peninsula Local Road Board, and the School Board of Advice. On 16 February 1885 Bews first entered the South Australian House of Assembly as member for Wallaroo, after Henry Allerdale Grainger resigned the previous month. Bews was re-elected on 19 March 1887, and at the General Election in 1890. In August of that year he accepted the office of Minister of Education in Thomas Playford II's Government. Bews, who had been appointed one of the South Australian delegates at the Postal Convention, died in Melbourne whilst en route to Sydney on 24 February 1891."

He started out as a Marxist critic but renounced the Marxism framework that he had used in the book Amruta mattu Garuda as too reductionist and became a much more eclectic and complex thinker. He is among the few Indian thinkers to shed new light on Dalit and Bahujan politics. He regarded the Gandhi-Ambedkar debate on the issue of caste system and untouchability as the most important contemporary debate whose outcome would determine the fate of India in the 21st century. He was one of the founders of the Bandaya movement along with Shudra Srinivas and Siddalingaiah, and gave the movement its famous slogan, Khadgavagali kavya! Janara novige midiva pranamitra!

A Le Monde critic called him a musical chameleon passing from punk and industrial to electro, garage, and rock. In his adolescence, he was part of the punk group Mad Coakroches and later formed his own band Punishment Park. At 21, he moved to more acoustic sounds with the group. He resided for about two years in Dinan in Côtes-d'Armor, an area that has been a source of inspiration for Da Silva. He recorded his first two self-financed albums in the local Théâtre des Jacobins. After Dinan, Da Silva moved to Rennes, where he created his own home studio. With help from Cali, who invited him to open up for some of his concerts, he released the album Décembre en été in 2005 that sold 110,000 copies and included the folk style single \"L'Indécision\". What followed was a more melancolic pessimistic album in 2007 titled De beaux jours à venir on his take on life in general. La Tendresse des fous in 2009 became his most successful commercial album that reached the French Top 20, followed by La distance in 2012 and Villa Rosa in 2013."

  "text" : "Denys Ovenden was born on April 1, 1922.His preoccupation with drawing began very early, since there are drawings on the fly-leaves of books from that period. His natural history interest began. Watercolor is the basic medium for his work, with occasional gouache for highlighting or detail. His preferred working surface is a fashion type board, CS2 not surface being the favorite. Reference sources are most important, and Denys uses a body-live, pinned or pickled, to work from, as pinned and set specimens can be misleading due to shrinkage, discoloration or loss of parts. He does use photographs although these vary enormously in terms of color bias. He uses textbook or specialist handbooks to confirm details of mouth parts, wing venation and other identification features. ' Denys Ovenden began his studies at Hornsey College of Art in 1938, with a five-year break from 1942 to December 1946 in the Royal Engineers, most of which was spent in North Africa and Italy. In 1950 he began working as a freelance illustrator, for London Zoo, The Radio Times, Crawfords Advertising Agency and Collins. A lot of time was also spent working with fellow ex-students at the Waverly Studio. In 1961 Denys Ovenden went to work on the part-work, Understanding Science, where he met Michael Chinery, a close and valued friend to this present time. With Michael he began a new phase of work for William Collins, first on Field Guide to the Insects of Britain & Northern Europe, then the ground-breaking Reptiles & Amphibians of Britain & Europe. This was followed by a number of other books for Collins, including entry level hand guides to Wild Animals and The Sea Coast. In 1987 ten plates were prepared for Harley books, Grasshoppers and Allied Insects of Britain and Ireland. There followed the Collins Guide to Freshwater Life a small share in the Collins Fungi Guide. Denys was commissioned by the Open University to prepare a poster accompanying David Attenborough's BBC series Life in Cold Blood. After a period of 15 years’ work, Galápagos, a Guide to the Animals and Plants. This finally went to print after the addition of illustrations two other recently discovered rodents and the elusive pink iguana."

  "text" : "Deborah Lou Turbeville (July 6, 1932 – October 24, 2013) was an American fashion photographer. Although she started out as a fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar, she became a photographer in the 70s. She is widely credited with adding a darker, more brooding element to fashion photography, beginning in the early 1970s. Turbeville is one of just three photographers, together with Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton, who essentially changed fashion photo shoots from traditional, well-lit images into something much more edgy. However, unlike the \"urban erotic underworld\" portrayed by her contemporaries, Turbeville's aesthetic tended towards \"dreamy and mysterious,\" a delicate female gaze. She was the only woman and only American among this trio. In 2009, Women's Wear Daily wrote that Tuberville transformed \"fashion photography into avant-garde art.\" Her photographs appeared in numerous publications and fashion advertisements, including ads for Bloomingdale's, Bruno Magli, Nike, Ralph Lauren and Macy's. Born in 1932 in Stoneham, Massachusetts, Turbeville died from lung cancer at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan on October 24, 2013, at the age of 81."

  "text" : "David Buchanan (1823 – 4 April 1890) was a barrister and politician in colonial New South Wales, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and later, the New South Wales Legislative Council. Buchanan was born in Edinburgh, Mid-Lothian, Scotland, the fifth son of William Buchanan, a barrister, and his wife Catherine, née Gregory. Buchanan was educated at the Edinburgh High School. Buchanan emigrated to Australia in 1852, and was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as member for Morpeth on 14 December 1860, and represented East Macquarie, from 6 October 1864 to 1 August 1867). He went to England in 1867, and entered at the Middle Temple in November of that year, being called to the bar in June 1869. He then returned to New South Wales, and practised his profession, being elected to the Legislative Assembly for East Sydney (3 December 1869 to 3 February 1872), and for Goldfields West (25 March 1872 to 12 October 1877). Though outvoted at Mudgee in 1879, he was ultimately declared duly elected on 6 January 1879, a seat he held until 7 October 1885. Buchanan represented Central Cumberland from 15 May 1888 to 19 January 1889. As a politician Buchanan gained prominence by his sturdy championship of fiscal protection. He revisited England in 1886, and published a selection from his orations and speeches. Having unsuccessfully contested Balmain at the general election in January 1889, he was nominated to the Legislative Council  on 27 February 1889, a position he held until his death."

  "text" : "David James Purslove Barker CBE (29 June 1938 – 27 August 2013) was an English physician and epidemiologist and originator of the Barker Hypothesis that foetal and early infant conditions have a permanent conditioning effect on the body's metabolism and chronic conditions later in life. He was born in London the son of Hugh Barker, an engineer, and Joye, a concert cellist. At Oundle school, he developed an interest in Natural History and was given special access to the biology classrooms to study his finds. The Natural History Museum later asked him to mount an expedition to collect plant specimens from the Icelandic offshore island of Grimsey. He studied medicine at Guy's Hospital, London, but maintained his interest in Natural History, and had his first paper published in Nature in 1961. After qualifying in 1962, he became a research fellow in the department of social medicine at Birmingham University. In 1969, with a grant from the Medical Research Council, Barker moved with his family to Uganda, to research Mycobacterium ulcerans infection (\"Buruli ulcer\"), demonstrating that it was caused, not by mosquitos, but by wounds caused by the razor-sharp reeds growing near the River Nile. He returned to England and in 1979 was appointed professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Southampton medical school, and in 1984 director of the Medical Research Council Environmental Epidemiology Unit, now the MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit. There he made the observations on the geographical relationship between neonatal and post-neonatal mortality and heart disease. He won the GlaxoSmithKline Prize in 1994 for this work. Barker was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 1998 and was appointed a CBE in 2006. He married twice; firstly to Angela, with whom he had three sons and two daughters, and secondly to Jan."

  "text" : "Desmond John \"Des\" Herbert (born 15 March 1959) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Collingwood and Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Herbert, who had to make his way up through the thirds, was a member of the Collingwood team that lost the 1979 reserves grand final to North Melbourne. In 1980 he made five senior appearances, late in the season, but lost his place in the team before the finals. He played a further three games in 1981 before being transferred to Fitzroy mid-season, along with Leigh Carlson and Matthew McClelland, in return for Warwick Irwin. His seven games for Fitzroy that year consisted of two finals, including their dramatic one-point loss to his former club in the semi-finals. After making only seven appearances over the next two seasons, Herbert joined reigning SANFL premiers West Adelaide in 1984 and won their Best and Fairest that year."

  "text" : "David C. Wilson (1789 – March 30, 1865) was a 19th-century banker, businessman and railroad executive; and the third mayor of Wilmington, Delaware. Wilson was part of various investment groups and companies. He was a founding director of the Delaware Fire Insurance Company, organized on August 19, 1825. He became a director of the Farmers' Bank of Delaware in 1825, and served as its president from Jan. 5, 1843, to March 31, 1845. On February 15, 1839, he was named a commissioner of the Union Bank of Delaware. On March 12, 1844, he became a founding director of the Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery Company. In the late 1830s, he became a director of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad, formed from the merger of companies that created the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore. (The main line survives today as part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.) His service as a railroad executive is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument in Philadelphia. Wilson helped organize the First Board of Trade of Wilmington, which was created \"for the better organization and regulation of the trade and business of Wilmington\", and whose founders included such local business leaders as Charles I. du Pont, Mahlon Betts, James Canby, William P. Brobson, and Jonas Pusey. Wilson was named its first president on January 3, 1837; he was also serving in the job in 1850. In 1846, he was brigade inspector for the New Castle Country's militia. Wilson also served on various public boards. In 1848, he was appointed by Wilmington's mayor to an 8-member board to examine the condition of the municipal Water Works. In 1852, he was one of the first members of the new Wilmington Board of Education. Wilson built several houses and other buildings in and around Wilmington. In 1840, his three-story house on the corner of 4th and Shipley Streets was badly damaged in a fire. In 1845, he built a four-story mercantile building at Market and Fifth Streets. In 1826, he bought and sold a cotton mill on the Brandywine River. Wilson, a member of the Whig Party, served as an alderman of Wilmington in 1841 and as the city's mayor from 1843 to 1845. Wilson died in New Castle County, Delaware, on March 30, 1865, and was buried in Wilmington's Presbyterian Church Cemetery."

  "text" : "Donna Martell (born December 24, 1927), is an American former actress in film and television. Born on December 24, 1927 in Los Angeles, California, as Irene Palma de Maria to Louis and Margaret de Maria, she began her film career in 1947 when she was cast in the Republic Pictures western Apache Rose, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. She continued making appearances throughout the late 1940s, signing a contract with Universal Studios. By the time the 1950s arrived, Martell's career shifted towards television shows such as Cavalcade of America, The Range Rider and Cheyenne. She was also in Project Moonbase (also known as Project Moon Base), a 1953 black-and-white science fiction film directed by Richard Talmadge. The film is unusual for its time in both attempting to portray space travel in a \"realistic\" manner, and for depicting a future in which women hold positions of authority and responsibility equal to men; in the script Martell's character, Briteis, is a colonel and outranks her fellow male astronaut, who is a major. Donna Martell's acting career officially ended in 1963; but made a short comeback in the 1983 TV movie Grace Kelly. She was presented one of the 2002 Golden Boot Awards for her contributions to western television and cinema. Donna Martell married baseball player Gene Edgar Corso on June 27, 1953, and are parents to three children."

  "text" : "Derik or Derick Baegert (ca. 1440 - after 1515) was a German late Gothic painter. Derick Baegert was probably born in Wesel around 1435-1440 to Johan Baegert, a merchant, and Mechtelt Mynreman. While his family wasn't very wealthy, Derick ended his life as one of the richer people of Wesel, living in a grand house on the Brückstrasse in the old town of Wesel. Painter Jan Baegert, in earlier literature named the Master of Cappenberg, was his son, and Jan Joest, who may have been his nephew, and the Master of the Schermbecker Altar were probably some of his pupils. Apart from some works for the city and churches of Wesel (including the retable for the Mathenachurch, largely destroyed in the Second World War), he also painted large altar pieces for churches like the Propsteichurch in Dortmund, and works for private devotion."

He went to China in 1838 at the age of 20. He became taipan of the Jardine Matheson & Co. on the retirement of Alexander Matheson. David in turn would hand over to his brother Sir Robert Jardine control of the firm. In February 1849 Governor George Bonham proposed creation of two unofficial membership in the Legislative Council. Bonham called the Justices of Peace together to elect two unofficial members on 6 December 1849. Jardine and J. F. Edger was elected as the first unofficial members of the Legislative Council in 1850. He died shortly after returning to Britain in 1856."

Davies was educated for the ministry at the Brecon Independent College, in that principality, but, his views having undergone a change in regard to some important religious doctrines, he resigned his charge, and entered on agricultural pursuits. Davies emigrated to South Australia, arriving at Adelaide in 1866, and removed thence to Ballarat, in Victoria, the next year, where he engaged in agricultural pursuits, in the Buninyong district. Davies was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Grenville in May 1877, and represented the constituency until his death on 18 June 1894. He is a strong Liberal and Protectionist, and was Government whip during the Graham Berry régime. In October 1887 he joined the Gillies-Deakin Cabinet, but held no portfolio till June 1889, when he became Commissioner of Public Works and Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works. From June to November 1890 he was Minister of Mines in the same Government, resigning with his colleagues at the latter date. Davies died in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia on 18 June 1894, survived by his wife (Sarah née Phillips) and by five sons and one daughter."

  "text" : "Drew Beattie (born 1952 in Atlanta, Georgia) is an American painter and sculptor whose earlier work is part of the collaborative team Beattie & Davidson, and later work is characterized by post-kitsch material choices. After Beattie graduated from the Museum School in Boston in 1978, his work was shown in various institutional exhibitions in California and emerging galleries in New York. In 1989 Beattie met the painter Daniel Davidson at Berkeley, while pursuing a teaching post. Lawrence Rinder wrote: “In the summer of 1989 Drew Beattie and Daniel Davidson decided to try making a painting together. Impressed with the results, they continued working in tandem in...a \"private laboratory.\" They were known for having a \"single imagination\" and a highly prolific, laboratory or factory-like experimental practice. The pair gained representation with Joseph Helman Gallery on 57th Street in New York  after a residency at the American Academy in Rome where Beattie later served as president of the Society of Fellows from 2009 to 2014. By the late nineties the Beattie & Davidson collaboration ended, and Beattie's work assumed a different tenor as grids and hexagonal patterns of colored shapes began to disappear from his paintings. There was also a gradual transition into highly dimensional painting and post-kitsch sculptural practices, which have been the subject of many reviews and acclaim. Since his intensified solo practice he has held posts at some of the major art programs in the United States including Harvard, UC Berkeley, the University of Chicago, Cooper Union, and Hunter College. Beattie's work has been the subject of numerous solo and group exhibitions at Leo Castelli Gallery, The Drawing Center, the Brooklyn Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, the Berkeley Art Museum, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, PS1, the High Museum of Art Atlanta, and many others. Beattie's 2012 exhibition at Hansel and Gretel Picture Garden, \"My Cookie\" was the first in which his sculpture appeared publicly."

  "text" : "David ben Joseph Pardo (c. 1591 – 1657) was a Dutch rabbi and hakham. He was born at Salonica to Rabbi Joseph and Reina in the second half of the sixteenth century. He went with his father to Amsterdam, where he became hakham of the Bet Yisrael congregation (founded 1618). This congregation was consolidated in 1639 with the other two congregations in Amsterdam, and Pardo was appointed hakham together with Isaac Aboab da Fonseca, Menasseh Ben Israel, and Saul Levi Morteira. He was also a trustee of the Jewish cemetery and hazzan of the Bikkur Holim organization. In 1625 he founded the Honen Dallim benevolent society. In 1610, Pardo published in Amsterdam a transcription in Latin characters of Zaddik ben Joseph Formon's Obligacion de los Coraçones, a translation of the Hobot ha-Lebabot into Judaeo-Spanish. On September 16, 1619, he married Rachel Sanchez (born 1595 at Moura, Portugal). They had three children: Joseph (c. 1624 – 1677), Josiah (1626-1684), and Sarah. Josiah Pardo served as a Rabbi in Curaçao and in Port Royal, Jamaica and was one of the first Rabbis in the New World. Pardo died at Amsterdam on March 15, 1657 (Rosh Chodesh Nisan, 5417 A.M.) and is buried at Beth Haim of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel."

Peevski succulent competing publications and as the owner of a number of newspaper distribution companies. Peevski graduated from 119 SOU in Sofia in 1998 and completed his legal studies at the South-West University in 2003. In 2001, Peevski joined the National Movement Simeon II (NMSII). He has been a member of DPS since 2009. In June 2013, Peevski was elected President of the State Agency for National Security, with the votes of 116 MPs. Under the pressure of the protests against the Oresharski cabinet that followed, Parliament unanimously revised this decision later the same month. The case became widely known in the entire European Union. After a couple of months lack of clarity whether under these conditions Peevski is still MP or not, eventually in December 2013 the Constitutional Court decided that he still is. In May 2014, Peevski was elected to the European Parliament on the MRF ticket, garnering 11 183 votes, but immediately thereafter decided to give up his seat, explaining that his motivation to participate in the European elections had been to restore his reputation. In mid June 2014, three people were arrested due to their involvement in an alleged murder plot against Peevski, but were eventually released because of a lack of sufficient evidence."

  "text" : "David Menasche (August 1, 1973 - November 20, 2014) was an American educator and a cofounding teacher of Coral Reef Senior High School in South Miami-Dade, Florida. Menasche began his teaching career at Coral Reef after earning his teaching certificate at Florida International University in 1997. In the fall of 2006, he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, a lemon-size brain tumor in his right temporal lobe indicative of Stage IV brain cancer, and given a few months to live. After undergoing three surgeries, two and a half years of chemotherapy, and 30 rounds of radiation, he was able to teach at Coral Reef for six more years until he suffered a seizure in 2012 that greatly reduced his peripheral vision in both eyes and weakened his left side, forcing him to give up teaching. Unable to return to Coral Reef, Menasche decided to embark on a quest to reconnect with some of the 3,000 students he had taught during his 15-year career. Calling it The Vision Quest, Menasche posted his plans to his old friends and students on Facebook with a call for couches, and ended up with 73 offers within three days. Menasche departed from Miami on November 2, 2012, with a list of 150 available couches across the country, filming and chronicling his journey along the way. Completing his trek in February 2013, he spent a total of 101 days on the road, visiting 31 cities, and seeing over 75 former students. Following his trip, he published an autobiography, The Priority List: A Teacher’s Final Quest to Discover Life’s Greatest Lessons. The title of the memoir comes from an exercise Menasche used with his high school students when studying Othello. It is a list of values that he asked students to prioritize for the play’s main characters in order to develop an understanding of motivation. Menasche had several tattoos, including the Dead Man’s Hand, famously tattooed on McMurphy from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, the words “Be Brave,” a 45 rpm adapter, and a hot air balloon tied to an anchor, which is the album cover image from Modest Mouse’s “We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank\". Menasche had two older brothers, Maurice and Jacques. He separated from his wife, Paula, after the Vision Quest. Menasche’s story gained national attention when Lidia Dinkova, a former student, contacted him to write a story for the Miami Herald. NBC, USA Today, and CNN then quickly picked up the story of Menasche’s Vision Quest and struggle with brain cancer. He died on November 20, 2014, aged 41."

  "text" : "Dylan Mohan Gray is an award-winning Indian filmmaker, best known for the documentary feature film Fire in the Blood, which in November 2013 set a new all-time record for the longest theatrical run by any non-fiction feature film in Indian cinema history (five weeks). Born on remote Prince Edward Island off Canada's Atlantic coast, where his biologist father served as a national park warden, Gray grew up with a keen interest in theatre, first as a child actor, then later moving into writing and directing plays, followed soon thereafter by videos (often using equipment borrowed from school sports programs). He was originally trained as a contemporary historian and expected to continue in academia, but began working in the film industry after a chance meeting in Budapest with a former acting colleague who was there working as an assistant director with David Cronenberg. He would go on to serve in various key capacities (often credited as \"D. Dylan Gray\") on international feature films in over two dozen countries worldwide, working in close collaboration with numerous acclaimed directors including Fatih Akin, Peter Greenaway, Paul Greengrass, Deepa Mehta and Mira Nair. Gray completed undergraduate studies in History and Film at Dartmouth College (USA), as well as at the University of Vienna and the Budapest University of Economics.

MacArt worked as the Deputy Chief Clerk in the Office of the Essex County Board of Elections in the late 1940s and early 1950s, before winning election as an East Orange Councilman in 1957 and 1961. He later served as Council Chairman. His bid for re-election to a third term on the East Orange City Council became the subject of controversy after a recount between him and Democrat Ben Sweetwood ended in a tie. A panel of New Jersey Appellate Court Judges awarded the seat to Sweetwood after four of MacArt's absentee ballots were invalidated. MacArt became a candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly in 1967, running in Essex County District 11D. He was the top vote getter for two seats in the Republican primary, with 3,978 votes. His running mate, Kenneth T. Wilson received 3,817 votes, followed by Alfred J. Sansone (3,025) and Ruth E. Hardy (2,959). In the general election, MacArt narrowly lost by a margin of just 266 votes, to Democrat Frank J. Dodd, who later served as New Jersey Senate President and was a candidate for Governor in 1981. Wilson ran first with 19,281 votes, followed by Dodd (19,101), MacArt (17,845), and Thomas H. Cooke, Jr., a future Mayor of East Orange (17,816). In 1968, MacArt sought the Republican nomination for Congress in the 11th district against George M. Wallhauser, Jr., the son of a former Congressman. He lost 12,134 to 6,090. MacArt attended The Peddie School and Temple University. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II from 1942 to 1946. He was the son of James A. MacArt (1883-1962), a public relations executive who worked for the Republican National Committee. His wife was the former Cleo M. Crooks. An usher at his 1950 wedding was William O. Barnes, Jr., who represented Essex County in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1952 to 1950."

  "text" : "David McCourt is an Irish-American entrepreneur with experience within the telecom and cable television industries. He grew up in Watertown, Massachusetts, and is a graduate of Georgetown University. In 1982 he founded McCourt Cable Systems, his first company. McCourt was an early contributor to the development of transatlantic fiber networks. He has founded or bought 14 companies in seven countries. One of the first recipients of the C Flag award, recognizing his contribution to telecommunications, media, education, and humanitarian efforts. McCourt purchased the first independent TV station within the Caribbean Island of Grenada, Discovery TV. In 2005, McCourt won an Emmy for the children's series Reading Rainbow and produced Miracle's Boys on Nickelodeon's new teenage network. His accomplishments also include being appointed as USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism's first resident economist. Mr. McCourt was also selected as the Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young LLP, as well as the top entrepreneur by the Harvard Business School Club of New York. He has served as Executive Producer, on the ten-part documentary series “What's Going On?” which documented the impact of global conflict on children around the world. McCourt has served as a member of the board of the company that eventually became WorldCom and $30 million worth of its shares. McCourt's net worth is estimated at $750 million. McCourt’s latest business ventures have seen a continued focus in Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) with a strong interest in emerging markets, including the Middle East. In May 2016, McCourt announced the first Public Private Partnership (PPP) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia following the revolutionary Vision 2030 reform plans outlined by deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, seeking to open up opportunities for foreign investment. The partnership saw the creation of a new joint venture between McCourt’s satellite firm Skyware Technologies and Saudi Arabia based space and technology organizations, TAQNIA and KASCT, setting out to propel the Kingdom as a world leading exporter of satellite technology. Shortly after, in June 2016, McCourt launched ALTV.com, a digital TV platform designed to meet the needs of the four billion technologically underserved people around the world. Continuing to grow McCourt’s footprint in his ancestral country of Ireland, ALTV launched with headquarters in Dublin, with initial plans for rollout across the Middle East and North Africa. In July 2016, it was announced that a consortium bid headed by Granahan McCourt and its subsidiary enet was successfully shortlisted by the Irish government in its tender process to develop Ireland’s €1.5bn National Broadband Plan. McCourt’s consortium is a collection of investors with significant success in telecoms, infrastructure, power and Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). This includes Granahan McCourt Capital, the John Laing Group and 3i Plc. The members of the consortium are being supported by their build and operate partners: enet, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy and The Kelly Group."

  "text" : "David \"Davy\" Smith Gordon (29 December 1882 – 1963) was a Scottish football player and manager. Gordon, who was born and raised in Leith, played for local side Leith Athletic while also working as a French polisher. He moved to England in 1905 to play for Hull City, for whom he made over 270 appearances in nine years. Gordon returned to Leith Athletic in 1914, before moving to Hibernian in 1916. After Hibernian manager Dan McMichael died due to the effects of the flu pandemic, Gordon was appointed manager in February 1919. His time in charge of Hibernian was unsuccessful, but he signed some players who reached Scottish Cup finals in 1923 and 1924 under his successor, Alex Maley. Gordon resigned as Hibs manager in April 1921. After this he had short stints as a player with Kilmarnock, St Bernard's and Leith Athletic, before his playing retirement in 1922. Gordon later managed Hartlepools United and St Bernard's."

  "text" : "Duilio Cambellotti (10 May 1876 – 31 January 1960) was an Italian applied artist, illustrator, painter, sculptor and designer who played a role in the Arts & Crafts and Art Nouveau movements, and whose influence was social and political as well as aesthetic and artistic. He is recognized for his versatility across a spectrum of visual and design disciplines, and for his fidelity to agrarian themes. Cambelotti was born in Rome. He received a diploma in accounting, but soon after receiving it he enrolled at an applied arts education program at the Industrial Artistic Museum in Rome, where he learned metal engraving. He also travelled to Naples, Athens and Istanbul to learn more. He was a proponent of the ideas of William Morris, and like Morris believed in the need to restore craftsmanship and quality to visual art, ornamentation and design. Cambellotti was also drawn to the visual vocabulary of Art Nouveau. He produced illustrations in that style for magazines, books and newspapers, and his furniture design (he was known for \"Cambellotti lamps\" and tables) is considered emblematic of Art Nouveau concepts. His gifts were recognized and his illustrations of Dante's Divine Comedy won the Alinari Prize in 1901 while he was still in his twenties. He discovered theater production and set design a few years later and quickly established a name for himself in that area as well. Yet another medium he that suited his sensibility and talents was stained glass, and from 1910 into the 1920s he exhibited notable stained glass works, in addition to being one of the organizers for the shows themselves. Throughout his career he was aware of the social significance of decoration and, influenced by William Morris, he became a leading figure among artists who were intellectually and aesthetically trying maintain a connection with the organic immediacy of style found in traditional handmade objects and in traditional pictorial coherence, as opposed to the slick surfaces and machine-like images inspired by the Industrial Era. Cambellotti found much to admire in the theories of \"rational beauty\" advocated by Henry van de Velde, one of the founders of Art Nouveau in Belgium, but at the same time the Italian artist remained loyal to agrarian motifs, and to a non-anthropotechnic, undisrupted relationship with natural forms. The most frequent motif in his works is an ear of corn. He is classed along with Vittorio Grassi (1878–1958) as a leading proponent of the Scuola Romana (as a branch of Art Nouveau), and he steadfastly celebrated the \"heroic atmosphere\" of the peasant culture over the decadence of cities. Duilio Cambellotti died in Rome on 31 January 1960. The life of Duilio Cambellotti spanned revolutions introduced by the Industrial Era and automation, which were accompanied by the emergence of modern aesthetics, the rise and fall of fascism in Italy, and more; all these changes are reflected in his entire oeuvre in some way. Cambellotti was interested in his home city of Rome not only via the agricultural world which supported it from its beginnings, but also in its spiritual and mythographic history. He had mastered the traditional medium of tempera and he created memorable historical and mythological paintings using it—the Roman Legends series, as well as the original tempera works from which the posters of the Greek Theater in Syracuse were printed—and such landmark achievements are still exhibited in prominent galleries (for example the Galleria Sperone Westwater in Lugano, Dec 2-13 - Jan 2014). The most complete expression of Cambellotti's mature architectural and interior design style is to be found in the Palazzo dell'Acquedotto (\"The Water Museum\") in the city of Bari, capital of the Apulia region of Italy. There is also a Duilio Cambellotti Museum in the city of Latina, located about 40 mi. south of Rome."

In December 2013, it was revealed that he had added human blood components to rabbit blood to make it appear as though a vaccine he was working on had exhibited anti-HIV activity. As a result of this apparent positive result, Han and his team received approximately $19 million in grant money from the National Institutes of Health. After Han's fraud came to light, James Bradac, who oversees AIDS grants for the National Institutes of Health, called it \"the worst case of research fraud he’d seen in his more than two decades at the agency,\" according to the New York Daily News. In June 2014, as a result of his receiving grant money due to falsified results, Han was indicted on four federal felony counts of making false statements. Han pleaded guilty in federal court in February 2015. On 1 July 2015 Han was sentenced to 57 months imprisonment for fabricating and falsifying data in HIV vaccine trials. He was also fined US$7.2 million and will be subject to three years of supervised release after he leaves prison."

Southwell joined the Navy at the age of sixteen and travelled to Australia as midshipman, and later as Mate, aboard the Fleet flagship HMS Sirius. He remained in the newly established penal colony for three years, including one year as commander of the lookout station at Sydney's South Head. A series of letters from Southwell to his parents in England offer depictions of early colonial life and the first substantive interactions between Europeans and Australian Aborigines. The letters also reveal clashes between the colonial Governor, Captain Arthur Phillip, and his senior military officer Major Robert Ross, and Southwell's deep pessimism regarding the colony's economic and governmental prospects. Southwell returned to England in 1791 and was promoted to lieutenant in 1794. He saw active service in the early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars but was wounded in action off the Portuguese coast and died in Lisbon Hospital on 21 August 1797."

On August 15, 1939 Nath took part in the founding meeting of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB). During the Second World War he went to India to study. He obtained a M.B.B.S. degree there. During his stay in India he was active in the Communist Party of India. He led the field work of the Bengal Medical Relief and Coordination Committee. He worked closely with Dr. B.K. Bose (from the Congress Medical Mission to China), organizing relief efforts for the people of Bengal suffering from plague and famine. He was also active in organizing the Tramway Workers Union. In 1947 he returned to Burma and began to practice at the Rangoon General Hospital. However, politics would soon put an end to his career. Dr. Nath went underground in March 1948. He set forth to travel to Pyinmana, where the party headquarters was located, reaching the site in May 1948. Dr. Nath served as a member of the Central Committee of the party. As a medical practitioner in the communist movement, Dr. Nath trained the first batch of medical brigades of the party. He was a key figure in the party in the 1950s. Dr. Nath was a Political Commissar for the party in the North-West Military Region, operating in Sagaing and Magwe. He served as the principal of the Central Medical School of the Communist Party of Burma. On November 9, 1968 the 77th Division of the Burma Army attacked the CPB Medical School in the Pegu Yoma mountain range. Several students of the school were killed in the attack. Dr. Nath and a small group of followers managed to escape, but was killed by Army forces on November 11, 1968."

  "text" : "David Walter Hamlyn (1 October 1924 – 15 July 2012) was Professor of Philosophy at Birkbeck College, London (1964–1988), and editor of Mind (1972–1984). His major interests were in Aristotle (whose de Anima, II and III and parts of I, he translated with a commentary, 1968) and in Ludwig Wittgenstein, both of whom influenced Hamlyn's approach to questions in epistemology and philosophy of psychology. His central thesis, developed in Experience and the Growth of Understanding (1978), Perception, Learning and the Self (1983), and In and Out of the Black Box (1990), was that in order to be a knower a being must be active and seek to regulate its beliefs in accord with a norm of truth: this requires membership of a community, interaction with which involves emotional responses. In short, knowers are social, affective agents. The other main area of Hamlyn's writing was the history of philosophy."

  "text" : "Doug Siebum is an Audio Engineer and Sound Editor who has worked in many areas of the audio industry. His career began working with bands when he was still in High School. He was friends with a Sacramento Punk band called One Sixty. He would help drummer Josh Cole carry his drums and set them up for shows. Although he lost touch with most of the band, he maintained ties with lead singer, Ryan Scalise who later sang in the Punk band Drowning Adam that played Warped Tour and Coachella. After High School, Siebum continued to be involved with the music industry and members of the Sacramento Hip Hop group, Fam Bam Entertainment suggested that he learn how to run some of the audio equipment. In 2001, he enrolled in an audio class at Sacramento City College to try it out. He later graduated from Sacramento City College with an associate degree in Audio Production. In 2005 he moved to Los Angeles where he would receive a bachelor's degree in Digital Media Arts from California State University Dominguez Hills (CSUDH). It was at CSUDH that he met Ameno and Edwin Guardado who started PerreoRadio.com. While still in school, he began working at PerreoRadio.com which was an online Reggaeton radio station owned by Jay Rifkin. He worked there for one year while he was in school and for a year afterwards. While working at PerreoRadio.com, he began working part-time at a professional sports stadium called the Stub Hub Center, which is home to the LA Galaxy and Chivas USA. He began mixing the live sound for professional sporting events and gained a reputation as a live sound engineer for in-stadium broadcasts. Although he is mostly known for his work in-stadium, Siebum has also worked as A1 (head audio engineer) for TV trucks. Siebum has worked with big names such as Katy Perry, Dizzy Reed from Guns N' Roses, Rick Barton from Dropkick Murphy's, Marc Orell from Dropkick Murphy's, Bad Religion, Dead Sara, Sheila E, and many more. He is also known for his work with Tony Newton, who is an original Motown bass player and keyboard player who has played on albums for bands such as The Supremes, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Arethra Franklin, Smokey Robinson, Michael Jackson and the Jackson 5, Little Richard, and many more. Siebum was selected as the music recordist for Newton's documentary, Groove Monster because Newton wanted the recording to have that live sound feel. Siebum also worked in clubs such as the world famous Whiskey a Go-Go and Harvelle's in Long Beach and Santa Monica. It was through his work in the clubs that he became friends with bands such as Whiteboy James and the Blues Express, the Vespertines, Captain Jeffery and his Musical Chumbuckets, and C-Gak. He spent a lot of time mixing bands from the Rip Cat Records label. He also worked music festivals such the Sunset Strip Music Festival, Culture Collide Festival, and Coachella. People often reference him for advice on working with bands, Sound Engineers, and how to get started in the entertainment industry. Doug Siebum is also known for his work in Audio Post Production. He interned at both Wild Woods Post and Hacienda Post. He has worked on a number of short films and indie features. He is most well known for his work on the independent feature film, Come Together where he worked closely with Director Charles Unger and Sound Supervisor James Morioka. The film received a distribution deal through Indican Pictures and the film is now distributed both domestically and abroad. Come Together is a Dramedy that is in the Spirit of American Pie and The Big Bang Theory. Come Together takes place during the 1992 LA Riots. Come Together won a Silver Ace Award at the Las Vegas Film Festival, a Platinum Reel Award at the Nevada Film Festival, and was a finalist in the Latino Screenplay Competition. Come Together was also an Official Selection at the Beverly Hills High-Definition Film Festival, the First Take Film Festival, and the Mammoth Film Festival. This was Unger's Second indie feature. Siebum recently finished up working as Sound Editor for an animated short by Charles Unger called the Punky Pets: Playing Party Politics. Playing Party Politics is a follow up to an earlier Punky Pets short called International Icon that won Best Children TV Series at the Canada Film Festival. The Punky Pets also won an award in Hawaii. In 2011, Siebum went on the Vans Warped Tour along with the Punky Pets, Neo Geo, Gym Class Heroes, and Shut up & Deal to support the Punky Pets. Siebum was also the re-recording mixer for a short called The Love Remains by Angela Park, which got into a film festival by KVCR, a PBS program. Siebum is currently working on editing audio books and other films."

  "text" : "Dugald \"Doug\" McGregor was a pioneering rugby league footballer of the 1900s and 1910s from Queensland. An Australia national representative fullback, he also played for both the Queensland and New South Wales teams. McGregor played in Brisbane for the Fortitude Valley club.During the 1909 New Zealand rugby league tour of Australia, when the Kiwis traveled to Brisbane for a Test match against Australia, McGregor was selected to play at fullback, becoming Kanagroo No. 46. In doing so he also set the record for the youngest player for Australia at 19 years and 5 days. When the New Zealand Māori rugby league team toured that year, McGregor played at fullback against them for Queensland as well as Australia. The following year, during the 1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, when they travelled to Brisbane for a Test match against Australia, McGregor, who was playing for Bundaberg, was selected to represent his country. McGregor later moved south, joining Sydney club, Glebe for the 1912 NSWRFL season. That year he was selected to play for New South Wales at fullback against Queensland, kicking three goals."

From 2009 to 2013, she was the representative for District 96, now held by another Benton County Republican, Grant Hodges. Term-limited in the House, Hobbs ran for Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas in the Republican primary election held on May 20, 2014. She finished a distant third with 16 percent of the vote; the nomination went instead to departing U.S. Representative Tim Griffin of Arkansas's 2nd congressional district. Hobbs had been a candidate for governor of Arkansas but decided to switch to the lieutenant governor position because of poor fundraising compared to her better-known primary opponents, Tim Griffin and Andy Mayberry."

  "text" : "Dorothy Proctor is a Canadian author and activist noted for drawing attention to scientific experimentation on Canadian prisoners. Proctor was born in Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. In 1961, she was sentenced to three years at the Prison for Women in Kingston, Ontario after being convicted of robbery as a teenager. She escaped from the facility on two occasions. After the second escape, Proctor alleges she became a subject in a prison psychology experiment involving the administration of electroshock therapy, sensory deprivation, and LSD. She described the experience as akin to Dante's Inferno. In 1994, Proctor published her autobiography, Chameleon: The Lives of Dorothy Proctor, in collaboration with Fred Rosen, a professor of journalism at Hofstra University. In it she described being involved in prostitution and the drug trade from a young age. She wrote of working with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and \"claims to have played a major role in breaking up Chinese, Jamaican and Europe-to-Canada drug-smuggling rings and exposing corrupt Mounties\", as well as infiltrating the Mafia and a Sikh terrorist cell. Proctor sued Correctional Service Canada in 1995 for C$5 million in damages. She testified that \"she was targeted by researchers because she was viewed as a 'throwaway'\", and that her treatment in prison had resulted in a drug addiction and brain damage. Although Proctor's suit was ultimately settled out of court in 2002, it led to significant media attention on the issue, and a number of former inmates at both the women's prison and the Kingston Penitentiary came forward with similar claims, along with allegations that they had been the subject of clinical pharmaceutical trials. Ultimately, hundreds of prisoners were found to have been subjected to scientific experimentation in Canadian prisons through the 1960s and 1970s."

Evocative and meaningful, Dave's work is an essential part of the storytelling.\" Porter stated that influences on the series' music came from discussions with Vince Gilligan, the creator of Breaking Bad, about the show having aspects of a post-modern western. For the final episodes of the series, Porter incorporated four important themes that were in previous seasons. Porter currently composes music for NBC's crime thriller The Blacklist, as well as for the Breaking Bad prequel series Better Call Saul. Porter has a wife, Jeanine, and a son."

Taylor, winner of the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, has written, \"David Slavitt is among the most accomplished living practitioners\" of writing, \"in both prose and verse; his poems give us a pleasurable, beautiful way of meditating on a bad time. We can't ask much more of literature, and usually we get far less.\" Novelist and poet James Dickey wrote, \"Slavitt has such an easy, tolerant, believable relationship with the ancient world and its authors that making the change-over from that world to ours is less a leap than an enjoyable stroll. The reader feels a continual sense of gratitude.\" Georgia Jones-Davis, a poet and journalist, has said, \"Slavitt is brilliant and he writes with grace, passion and humor.\""

  "text" : "Dirk Bergemann is the Douglass & Marion Campbell Professor of Economics and Computer Science at Yale University. He received his Vordiplom in Economics at Goethe University Frankfurt in 1989, and both his M.A. and Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992 and 1993 respectively. Bergemann's research is concerned with game theory, contract theory and mechanism design. His research has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship and the German National Science Foundation. Bergemann is the foreign editor for the Review of Economic Studies, and the associate editor of several other publications, including American Economic Journal, Econometrica, Games and Economic Behavior and the Journal of Economic Theory. Bergemann has made important contributions to the theory of mechanism design. In his work with Stephen Morris on robust mechanism design, they relaxed common knowledge assumptions which were prevalent in the early mechanism design literature. By formulating the mechanism design problem more precisely, they showed that simple mechanisms arise endogenously. This provided a theoretical justification for the relatively simple auction designs employed in practice, when compared to the complexity of optimal auctions suggested by the early literature. Bergemann has also pioneered work with consumer behavior around dynamic pricing structures."

O'Flynn made his screen debut in Marked Woman (1937), after which he was a freelance player for such studios as Warner Brothers, Paramount, and RKO Pictures. While serving in World War II, he was cast with several other actors-in-uniform in  Winged Victory, a production of 20th Century Fox. O'Flynn appeared in many western films and television series. He was cast with Ben Cooper in Gunfight at Comanche Creek (1963) and had a bit part in The Far Country (1954) with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan . He appeared in two secondary roles in sixty episodes of the American Broadcasting Company/Desilu series, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, with Hugh O'Brian in the title role of Marshal Wyatt Earp. When the series was set in Dodge City, Kansas, O'Flynn played Judge Tobin; when the locale was moved to Tombstone, Arizona, he became Dr. Goodfellow. In the \"Frontier Surgeon\" (January 19, 1960) episode of The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Dr. Goodfellow must obtain a truce with Marshal Earp who is apprehending a wounded outlaw. The man will die if moved after surgery, but he does not wait the three days to recuperate out of distrust of Earp and the protection of the $15,000 loot he and his gang have taken from Wells Fargo. His acting career ended in 1969, and he died in 1982 in Los Angeles, California."

Reeder is noted for his original compositions (with titles such as Food and Pussy and Bach is dead and gone) which are often described as odd, original and humorous. His music has received critical acclaim for its unique blending of blues, folk, gospel and field hollers, but also criticism for his rather indelicate choice of song topics. He writes, arranges, and engineers his recordings on which all instruments and vocals are played by and sung by himself through the use of multi-layering. Reeder is also an instrument-maker and builds most of the instruments that he uses for recordings and live shows. Besides being a musician and recording artist, Reeder is also a painter and art teacher."

  "text" : "Dick Robertson (New York City, 3 July 1903 - 1979) was an American popular big band singer and songwriter of the 1930s and 1940s. He sang for many bandleaders such as Leo Reisman and Roger Wolfe Kahn and His Orchestra, and was on the artist roster at Banner Records. In fact, he was one of the most prolific New York based vocalists (along with Irving Kaufman, Chick Bullock, Scrappy Lambert, Elmer Feldkamp, Paul Small and Smith Ballew) on scores of records from late 1928 through the mid 1930s. A series of records issued on Melotone/Perfect/Banner/Oriole/Romeo, Crown, Bluebird from 1930-1934 were issued under his name or are listed in the 2010 edition of \"American Dance Bands on Record and Film (1915-1942)\" by Richard J. Johnson and Bernard H. Shirley as being under his nominal leadership. His last recording session as a singer was in 1949. He also used the pseudonym Bob Richardson for some recordings on Mayfair Records. As a songwriter his biggest hit was \"We Three (My Echo, My Shadow, and Me)\" in 1940. The Sinatra version of the song was re-released on The Song Is You (album) and again on Frank Sinatra & the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra. Jukebox Ella: The Complete Verve Singles, Vol. 1"

Martin's 16mm films address the space between disparate states of being–levels of consciousness, the internal and the external, and the body, mind, and object–working to unravel viewer's learned habits of perception. Martin's films also often explore the differences and similarities between other artistic mediums including painting, performance, dance, and sculpture. Some subjects Martin's work touches on include dreams, feminism, sensation, mythology, and mirror-touch synesthesia."

  "text" : "Dragutin Rakovac (or Rakovec) (November 1, 1813 – November 22, 1854) was a Croatian writer, translator and journalist. He was born in Vugrovec. He received a degree in philosophy and law in 1831 in Zagreb. From 1831 he was employed at the Tabula Banalis and in a law clerk office. He was an associate of Ljudevit Gaj and an editor of the Novine horvatske (1835-1842). Together with Ljudevit Vukotinović and Stanko Vraz he founded and edited magazine Kolo in 1842. Since 1841 he served as a secretary of the Economic Society and an editor of several of its publications. He also edited Koledar za puk (1847-1850). He founded the magazine Gospodarki list and edited it in 1841-1850. He became the first curator of the National Museum in 1846. In his youth Rakovac wrote, translated and adapted works in the Kajkavian dialect (Theodor Körner and others). His adaptation of a monodrama by August von Kotzebue Stari mladoženja i košarice was published in 1832. The only preserved original dramatic work of his is a dramatic poem Duh (\"Spirit\", 1832), while the play Veronika od Desenic, started in 1831, is today is only known by its title. His first work in the Štokavian dialect was published in 1835 in the first issue of Danica ilirska, where he continued to publish Illyrian patriotic and later love poetry (Sila ljubavi, 1837 and others), foreshadowing romantic Neopetrarchism. According to a Slovakian template he wrote a poem Duh slavjanski (\"The Slavic Spirit\"), from which three stanzas became the anthem of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Hey, Slavs). Together with Ljudevit Vukotinović he published the first Croatian anthology of patriotic poetry: Pjesmarica: pjesme domorodne in 1842. In his political essay Mali katekizam za velike ljude (\"A small catechism for great people\", 1842) he defends the dignity of the Croatian language and the right to defend the Croatian national identity against the Hungarian encroachments. His memoirs Dnevnik (1922) were published posthumously, and represent an important historical account of the Illyrian movement. He died in Zagreb."

  "text" : "Derek Richter (14 January 1907 – 15 December 1995), English neuroscientist, was one of the founding fathers of the science of brain chemistry. Identifying monoamine oxidase and demonstrating its function in the brain early in his career, he became a prime mover in his field. In 1968 he was involved in the foundation of the British Brain Research Organization (BRA). Prior to this he helped to establish the Mental Health Research Fund, later renamed The Mental Health Foundation,(1949). He also established the Journal of Neurochemistry (1956), of which he was one of the chief editors from 1956 to 1969. He was involved in the foundation of the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO) (1960), of which he became secretary-general, and the International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN) (1967). After leading a research unit at Whitchurch Psychiatric Hospital (1947–1960), he became director of the Medical Research Council Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton (1960–1971). Throughout his life he promoted international collaboration in research."

During this period he translated the New Testament into Albanian.

  "text" : "Dmitry Gabrilovich, M.D., Ph.D., is a researcher and Christopher M. Davis professor at The Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. His laboratory at Wistar focuses on methods by which tumors are able to suppress the immune system and how to develop new immune therapies to combat this ability. The Gabrilovich lab focuses on immature myeloid cell biology and its relation to cancer. These cells have been linked to a number of signaling pathways associated with cancer, including NF-κB, Jak-STAT, Notch, Wnt, and Rb, among others. His research has found that tumor cells can go through a mechanism that produces a free radical peroxynitrite, causing them to become resistant to certain types of cancer immunotherapy. His research has also focused on monocytic-myeloid derived suppressor cells and polymorphonuclear-myeloid derived suppressor cells and what impact they might have on cancer therapy, since myeloid derived suppressor cells negatively regulate anti-tumor activity. Prior to joining The Wistar Institute, Gabrilovich was a senior member at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa."

  "text" : "David Frost Sellin (1930, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – 11 April 2006, Washington, D.C.) was an American art historian, educator, and author. He taught at a number of universities, worked on the staffs of several museums, and served as curator of the U.S. Capitol, 1976-1980. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he attended Quaker schools. As a teenager, he studied privately with painter Frank B. A. Linton, a former student of Thomas Eakins, and spent a year in Sweden in the atelier of painter Otte Sköld. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in art history from the University of Pennsylvania. He returned to Stockholm to study for a year at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, and studied for two years in Rome as a Fulbright scholar. He returned to Philadelphia, worked as an assistant curator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and completed a doctorate in art history at the University of Pennsylvania. He became director of schools at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA), a position Eakins once had held. His research into the influence of France on 19th-century Philadelphia artists – notably Joseph A. Bailly, Mary Cassatt, Eakins, and Howard Roberts – culminated in a 1973 exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Sellin curated three additional exhibitions that featured Eakins as a subject: American Art in the Making: Preparatory Studies for Masterpieces of American Painting, 1800-1900 (Smithsonian Institution, 1976); Thomas Eakins, Susan Macdowell Eakins, Elizabeth Macdowell Kenton (PAFA, 1977); and Thomas Eakins and His Fellow Artists at the Philadelphia Sketch Club (Philadelphia Sketch Club, 2001). His research into expatriate American artists who settled in France led to a 1982 joint exhibition by PAFA and the Phoenix Art Museum, that also traveled to France. He was a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, American University, Tulane University, the University of Texas, and other universities. He served on the faculties of Colgate University and Wesleyan University, where he also directed their art galleries. He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1971, to work at what is now the Smithsonian Museum of American Art. As curator of the U.S. Capitol, he oversaw restoration of four of the massive paintings in the Rotunda, and conserved hundreds of 19th-century drawings by the building's architect, Thomas U. Walter. He published numerous articles on American artists, and worked as an independent curator and consultant."

  "text" : "Danica d'Hondt (born May 29, 1939) is an English-born Canadian actress, writer and businesswoman. A winner of the Miss Canada pageant in 1959 was born in London, England, of an Irish mother and a Belgian father. Sister of Olympic Gold Medalist Walter D'Hondt and mother of actress America Olivo, mother-in-law of actors Christian Campbell and Jason Brooks. Originally an actress, Danica soon found that she had a natural talent as a theatre director, a role not easily accepted for women at that time. She began her career at the age of nine by appearing in a movie at Shepperton Studios in England. She worked in radio, TV and on stage in Canada, where her family emigrated while she was still in school. She graduated from High School in Montreal, and returned to England after attending the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. She worked as a stage actress in London, also performing in radio and TV dramas for the BBC, and then relocated to Toronto, Canada, where she became a CBC-TV game show personality and a talk show host at an unusually early age, interviewing celebrities such as Broadway actress/dancer Gwen Verdon and the late Jazz great Dizzy Gillespie. She also appeared on TV shows out of New York City, and in summer stock theatre in New York and Illinois. She starred with comic Harvey Korman in Living Venus (1961), a film shot in Chicago in 1960. Danica's Hollywood career spans the years from 1960 to 1990, during which time she starred in \"B\" movies, played supporting roles in major Hollywood movies, and performed guest-starring roles on such popular TV shows of the time as The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (1964); The Wild Wild West (1965) and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1964). Naively, she turned down the role of \"Ginger\" in Gilligan's Island (1964). She left Hollywood from 1966 to 1971, during which time she worked as a theatre director in the San Francisco Bay Area, where she also wrote for a magazine, produced educational films and taught acting at her own school, \"The Actor's Lab\", on Sacramento Street. Upon her return to Hollywood, in 1971, she directed several very successful stage productions, worked as a writer and associate producer in film and television, and did a stint as a television journalist, becoming the Consumer and Financial Reporter to a syndicated daytime magazine show called \"Breakaway\". Relocating to Northern California in the 1990s, Danica has been occupied with several businesses she runs with her husband and is active in real estate investing. She has been busy as a writer with two non-fiction books published, and several others in the works. After Dan Brown's success, she wants to attempt a novel. In between the variety of career changes, Danica has been busy raising a family of six children. She currently lives with her husband, Nello Olivo on a vineyard in the Sierra Foothills, where she writes, teaches, and helps her winemaker husband tend their vineyard. The couple also owns a large restaurant and banquet facility in Placerville, California, named \"Sequoia\"."

The Teaching Assistants provide extra assistance and grade their students assignments and tests. Grinde also is responsible for this along with providing the lecture for the classes. As far as performance for his lecturing skills go his track record is on the negative side. An anonymous student once said, \"I don't understand how he got employed\". On ratemyprofessor.com, a site were students review their professors, there are mainly negative reviews and the only positive trend is that Grinde provides answers to tests. Overall the opinion of his students remains sunstantially negative for the time being. He served as a thesis adviser for Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, former Prime Minister of Somalia."

It sat alongside novels such as Gone Girl and The Fault in Our Stars. To date, over 200,000 copies have been sold and it has been critically acclaimed around the world, as well as being translated into six languages. A major TV company has optioned the series, with an eye to filming it in 2015. Follow-up Original Skin was released in April 2013. It continues the story of DS Aector McAvoy, a Scottish policeman based in Hull's Serious And Organised Crime Unit, following him as he investigates suspicious deaths within the city's sleazy underworld, while contending with changing politics within the force. The third novel, Sorrow Bound  was also a critical success. Before signing his publishing deal with Quercus, Mark was a journalist specialising in crime reporting for a number of newspapers and agencies - most notably for the Yorkshire Post in their Hull office. He spent time as a showbusiness reporter for the Press Association, though he has claimed he loathed the experience."

  "text" : "Mary Virginia \"Jimmie\" Carpenter was a 21-year-old woman from Texarkana, Texas, who went missing in Denton, Texas, in the summer of 1948. Her disappearance remains unsolved. Carpenter was last seen by a taxi driver around 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday, June 1, 1948. Numerous individuals have reported seeing her over the years, but none of these sightings have been confirmed. Her mother, Mrs. Hazel E. Carpenter (who became Mrs. Hazel Smith later in life), spent many years helping the police chase down rumors and leads. She eventually gave up hope, believing that her daughter was dead. Although she still wanted her daughter to be found even if she was deceased. In 1998, Denton police received an anonymous tip that she was buried at the campus she was supposed to attend, but it turned out fruitless. Countless man-hours and almost a quarter of a million dollars were spent on the investigation. The case is cold but remains open. Speculation of Carpenter's disappearance was that The Phantom of Texarkana had gotten her since she knew three of the victims. The girl's mother convinced herself that Virginia was a victim of amnesia, not knowing who she was or where she was from, which prompted her to give the girl's life story for the second anniversary of her disappearance in the Denton Record-Chronicle; although the year before, she was convinced that her daughter was dead. Bones were found around Denton County in 1949, 1958 and 1960, but they were declared to not be Miss Carpenter. In 1985, Lewis C. Rigler, a Texas Ranger who was a lead investigator in the case, said that he was not surprised that what may have been the most famous missing person case in Texas was still drawing attention."

  "text" : "Dave Woods (10 March 1970) is an Australian rugby league player and coach. Woods has been involved in rugby since the age of three. He began as a ball boy for the Enfield Federals, his father's team, and the following year joined the under-6s rugby league. He later played junior rugby league for St George, serving the Jersey Flegg and under-23s as a captain. He also appeared as a reserve player for the Penrith Panthers and the Parramatta Eels,respectively from 1989-1997 and 1998-2001. He began coaching while still in junior rugby league. He took two teams to premierships in Parramatta, the Greystanes Devils to the under-17s C-grade and Merrylands to the top tier. After that, he became a development coach for the Penrith Panthers, which led eventually to his coaching the Castleford Tigers. In the 2005 season, the team achieved the National League One title and, under his direction, was promoted to Super League. Woods was then released by the Tigers because they wanted a better known coach to guide them in their Super League career. He later coached Gateshead Thunder and in his second season took them bottom of the table to champions of Championship 1. That year, he was awarded the NL2 Coach of the Year award. However, immediately thereafter, he was released by Gateshead Thunder. For several years, Woods left full-time rugby as he pursued a constructive dismissal case against the team that became complicated when bankruptcy terminated the team. During that time, he served as the Great Britain Community Lions Under-18s coach for the Rugby Football League. In April 2010, Woods joined the York City Knights, first as a part-time director of rugby and then, two months later, as coach. His contract was terminated in September 2011. In 2013, Woods took over as coach for the Whitehaven team."

By 1872 McLeod, in partnership with John Hancock, shipped stock to Nickol Bay, near Roebourne and McLeod set up Chirritta Station. In 1879 McLeod married Charlotte Harriet Bussell McLeod sold Chirritta in 1883 and returned to Portland to set up a dairy farm named Yannarie. He sold Yannarie in 1892 but remained in the area as the member for Portland in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from July 1894 to October 1900. McLeod left the area in 1899 and took up Minilya Station in the Mid West of Western Australia. He died in Perth on 25 October 1914 and was survived by his wife, six daughters and five sons."

  "text" : "Dale F. Rudd is an American Chemical Engineer and Donald C. Slichter Professor Emeritus of Engineering Research at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He is known for his influential work in process engineering, in particular for introducing computer aided process synthesis design strategies for large scale chemical industries. He co-wrote the first textbook in process engineering, and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1978. Rudd was born in 1935 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and received his BS in 1956 and his Ph.d. in 1959 in Chemical Engineering under Neal Amundson from the University of Minnesota. He was an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor before joining the Chemical and Biological Engineering department at University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1961.At the University of Wisconsin he developed the field of process synthesis in computerized process design. Process synthesis is used to design processes that can be used in commercial chemical plants. The significance is it uses computer algorithms to determine the chemical processes, reducing the costly need to test chemicals in full-scale production. Rudd's strategies have been used in areas such as waste treatment, chemical production and food processing. University of California Provost C. Judson King called Rudd's work “truly pioneering and important”. Rudd co-wrote with Charles C. Watson \"Strategy of Process Engineering\" (1968, John Wiley & Sons; Spanish Edition 1976), the first textbook in the field. His other textbooks include \"Process Synthesis\" with Gary Powers and Jeffrey Siirola (1974 Prentice-Hall), \"Strategy of Pollution Control\" with P. Mac Berthouex (1977, Wiley; Russian Edition 1980, Chinese Edition 1985), \"Petrochemical Technology Assessment\" with Fathi-Afshar, Trevino and Stadtherr (1981, Wiley), \"Impact of Future Catalytic Developments on the Chemical Industry\" with Dumesic and Trevino (1985, Catalytica Associates) and \"The Microkinetics of Heterogeneous Catalysis\" with Dumesic, Aparicio, Rekoske and Trevino (1993, American Chemical Society). He was on the editorial boards of John Wiley & Sons, International Chemical Engineering and AIChE Journal, and founded the engineering company Shanahan Valley Associates. Rudd's awards include a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1970, an Outstanding Educator in America in 1975, election to the National Academy of Engineering in 1978 and election to the founding class of the Washington State Academy of Sciences in 2008."

Wheelock was compared at the time to John Philip Sousa, and nominated to be bandmaster of the United States Marine Band. At the age of 40 he became an American Indian rights activist and attorney, and within several years was arguing cases for Indian nations at the United States Court of Claims and US Supreme Court. Wheelock was born in the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin. He went to Pennsylvania to be educated at the Carlisle Indian School, returning later for study at Dickinson Preparatory School. Wheelock was appointed as the first American Indian bandmaster of the internationally acclaimed Carlisle Indian School Band, which performed at world fairs, expositions, and presidential inaugurals. While at the school, he composed the Sousa-inspired \"Carlisle Indian School March.\" In 1900 he debuted his three-part symphony, Aboriginal Suite, at Carnegie Hall in New York City. In 1911 Wheelock was among the 50 founding members of the Society of American Indians, the first national American Indian rights organization developed and run by American Indians. He had read the law and passed the bar that year, practicing first in Wisconsin. As he represented more Indian nations in his practice, he moved to Washington D.C., where he represented them in actions against the government in the United States Court of Claims and the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1980, to honor him and the celebrated Carlisle Indian Band, Dennison Wheelock's Bandstand was reconstructed on the site of the original at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania."

  "text" : "Del Sharbutt (February 16, 1912 - April 26, 2002) was an American radio announcer. The son of \"a circuit-riding minister in the Texas panhandle,\" he was born in Cleburne, Texas, and died in Palm Desert, California. Sharbutt attended Texas Christian University, initially planning to study law. After he became involved in drama and music there, however, he changed his career plans. His first appearance on radio was in 1929 as a singer on WBAP in Fort Worth, Texas. He soon became an announcer and from that point on, he made his career in broadcasting. Sharbutt's obituary in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted that he spent \"four decades as an announcer, newscaster and company spokesman.\" A 1943 article in Radio Mirror magazine summarized Sharbutt's progress from local station WBAP to his then-current role at CBS:[At WBAP] Del was a one-man radio station, singing, acting and announcing at $25 per week. After several years of working stations all over the Southwest, he ended up at $19 a week. Not satisfied with this progress in reverse, he went to Chicago and, after starving for two weeks, took a job singing in a Presbyterian Church. There he met a man who steered him into his first break as an announcer on Chicago's station WJJD. Del stuck at that for a year and a half, then came to New York. He arrived without a single contact and, three days later, beat out 50 competitors for an important job at CBS. Old-time radio shows for which Sharbutt was an announcer included The Man I Married, Lavender and Old Lace, Guy Lombardo, Jack Pearl, Ray Noble, Bob Hope, The Song Shop, Hobby Lobby, Myrt and Marge, Hour of Charm, Melody and Madness, Colgate Ask-It-Basket, Lanny Ross,Amos 'n' Andy, Club Fifteen, The Jack Carson Show, Lum and Abner, Your Hit Parade., The Campbell Playhouse, Request Performance., Meet Mr. McNutley and Meet Corliss Archer. In 1958, Sharbutt was involved in an effort to revive a semblance of old-time radio on ABC. The Jim Backus Show was described in the Milwaukee Sentinel as \"what might be called an old-fashioned radio variety show.\" Sharbutt was the announcer for the program, which featured singers Betty Ann Grove and Jack Haskell and a quintet, The Honey Dreamers. Also in 1958, Harbutt became a disc jockey on WABC in New York City. He and another old-time radio announcer, Tony Marvin, began \"hosting afternoon record shows in their distinctively deep voices.\" Other on-air activities in radio for Sharbutt included being a newscaster for the Mutual Broadcasting System and being master of ceremonies for a Ringabuk, a local program in New York City. Sharbutt was an announcer for television programs including Who Do You Trust?, The Jerry Colonna Show, Your Hit Parade The Betty White Show (1954 version) All Star Revue and Kukla, Fran and Ollie. He also appeared as himself on the TV shows Of All Things, The Jerry Fielding Show, and The Saturday Night Revue with Jack Carter. Also, in something of a reprise of one of his regular jobs, Sharbutt played an announcer in the movie Hit Parade of 1947. After doing commercials for Campbell's Soup on several shows that he announced, Sharbutt became more closely associated with Campbell's as a company spokesman. His obituary in the Los Angeles Times noted, \"He voiced the commercials, touting the soups as 'Mmm-mm-good,'\" a slogan that he created."

  "text" : "David Hicks Overmyer (born Topeka, Kansas, April 5, 1889; died March 26, 1973) was an artist active in the 20th century in Kansas. He is most notable for his murals. His first major commission was in the Kansas State Library building, started in 1934 as part of the Works Progress Administration. The murals which depict the disciplines of K-State at the time, include panels focusing on the concepts of \"1) science and industry, 2) agricultural and animal husbandry 3) the arts [and] 4) the home.\" The preliminary studies for the mural are currently held by the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art on the Kansas State University Manhattan Campus. In 1951, the Kansas Legislature commissioned Overmyer to paint the first floor of the Kansas State Capital building with eight images depicting Kansas history. The scenes are titled The Coming of the Spaniards, Battle of Arickaree, Battle of Mine Creek, Building a Sod House, Lewis and Clark in Kansas, Westward Ho, Arrival of the Railroad, and Chisholm Trail. Overmyer married his wife née Grace McKinley Woodward (1894-1975) on May 21, 1921."

  "text" : "Dieter Stappert (October 13, 1942 - October 17, 2008) was an Austrian journalist and team manager in motorsport. By the year 1977 Stappert was editor-in-chief of the Swiss magazine Powerslide, now known as Motorsport Aktuell. From 1977 to 1985 he worked at the BMW Motorsport and one of his first programme was the touring car BMW Junior Team which promoted Eddie Cheever, Manfred Winkelhock and Marc Surer through the ranks. In 1980 Stappert took the role of Sporting Director and became responsible for BMW F1 programme, resulting in Nelson Piquet winning the 1983 F1 World Championship with the BMW-powered Brabham. In 1986 Stappert became the motorsport manager for HB tobacco brand, acting also as team manager of the 250cc world championship motorcycle racing team. He created a highly competitive team signing former Anton Mang's mechanic Franz-Josef \"Sepp\" Schlögl as technical director and starting a long-term relationship with Honda Racing Corporation to receive factory-spec NSR250s.Over the years the HB team won many races with riders like Reinhold Roth, Helmut Bradl and Ralf Waldmann but never achieved the world title, finishing as runner-up four times (1987, 1989, 1991 and 1996). After the withdrawal of HB from motorcycle road racing, Stappert established his own racing team in 1997 with Marlboro sponsorship and a factory Honda NSR250 for Ralf Waldmann who finished again second in championship.In 1998 the team received Castrol sponsorship and entered a NSR250 for Stefano Perugini with poor results. Since 1999 to 2005 the team raced with Aprilia motorcycles and was known as Aprilia Germany. During this period the most notable riders were Ralf Waldmann, Jeremy McWilliams and Chaz Davies. In 2006 Stappert managed the KTM Junior Team in the 125cc class with Stefan Bradl as rider. Dieter Stappert died in hospital in Munich on October 17, 2008 having never recovered full consciousness since a heart attack in June."

His early works are analyses of Pentecostalism and American Protestantism. He won the Pneuma Book Award from the Society for Pentecostal Studies in 2004. His current work focuses on world Christianity, including the books The World’s Christians: Who They Are, Where They Are, and How They Got There and Global Gospel: An Introduction to Christianity on Five Continents Jacobsen also co-directs the Religion in the Academy project with his wife Rhonda Hustedt Jacobsen, a scholar of higher education. This project has involved research at dozens of American colleges and universities and has resulted in three Oxford University Press books (2004, 2008, and 2012). Their book No Longer Invisible: Religion in University Education won a 2013 American Education Studies Association Critics' Choice Book Award. The American University in a Postsecular Age won the 2009 Lilly Fellows Book Award. Their work has also been featured in the popular press, including The Daily Beast and Inside Higher Ed. Jacobsen was born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Teaneck, New Jersey. He attended Wheaton College (IL) and then completed a masters and doctorate at the University of Chicago, where he studied with Martin E. Marty and Jerald C. Brauer. Jacobsen has taught at Messiah College in Mechanicsburg, PA, since 1984 and is currently Distinguished Professor of Church History and Theology. He has also been a visiting scholar at Pepperdine University. Jacobsen, a member of the United Church of Christ, is an ecumenical theologian whose thinking has been influenced by Anabaptist, Catholic, Evangelical, Orthodox, and Pentecostal perspectives. In 2006, he co-authored (with Rodney Sawatsky) a short introduction to theology entitled Gracious Christianity that emphasizes the role of love and gratitude in Christian life and thought."

  "text" : "David Brown (active 1792 ‒ 1797) was a British landscape and genre painter. According to Walter Gilbey, Brown was a house and sign painter who \"cherished higher artistic ambitions and had set his heart on learning to painting like George Morland,\" a British artist famous for his animal paintings and scenes of rustic life. After selling his business, Brown studied with Morland and became one of his many imitators. Although his paintings featured a more gestural brushstroke and a heavier use of impasto, his works often passed for those of his master. Brown exhibited ten paintings at the Royal Academy between 1792 and 1797, including pasticci of Morland and views of London, which some critics have suggested are his most successful works. He supplemented his income during these years by selling paintings by Morland that he had acquired during his tenure in the artist's studio. Brown eventually became a drawing master."
