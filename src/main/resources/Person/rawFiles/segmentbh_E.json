  "text" : "Emil Cohen (1911- February 12, 2000) was a Jewish-American comedian, humorist and entertainer. He was billed as \"America's Foremost American Jewish Humorist\". He frequently performed at the Grossinger Hotel in Liberty, New York, in the Catskill Mountains \"Borscht Belt\" where his Yiddish humor was well received by the predominantly Jewish audiences. Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1911 the son of Julius and Ida (Magidoff), he was raised in Wilmington, Delaware in a family that included his sister Rose and his brothers Hym and Phil. After serving in the United States Air Force during World War II, he joined the staff at the Grossinger Pancoast Hotel in Florida, where he began his career as a professional comedian and met his wife Lillian Rothman. They married in 1950, and had two sons, Jay and David. Emil Cohen developed a unique style of humor where jokes and stories ended with the punch line in Yiddish followed immediately by an English translation that was delivered so smoothly that the audience - including those who understood no Yiddish - easily got the joke in its authentic style. He was known for his double-entendre Yiddish-English humor, particularly his translation of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address into Yiddish. He was also a gifted raconteur and singer of traditional Yiddish songs, Chassidic melodies, Palestinian songs, and Jewish cantorial selections. His humor was inspired by the lives of the Jews of Eastern Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and he dedicated his career to the preservation of their heritage of Yiddish humor. He was also an inspirational speaker in support of Jewish philanthropic causes. Over the course of his career he raised tens of millions of dollars for the United Jewish Appeal and Israel Bonds. He continued to perform until about a year before his death in 2000 at age 88."

  "text" : "Elton Egedeous Engstrom, Jr. (February 26, 1935 – November 6, 2013) was an American lawyer, businessman, writer, and politician. Engstrom served one term apiece in the Alaska House of Representatives and the Alaska Senate as a Republican during the 1960s. He was also a part of one of Alaska's longest-enduring political families; his father served in Alaska's territorial and state legislatures, and his daughter is a current member of the Alaska House. Elton Egedeous Engstrom, Jr. was born in Juneau, Alaska, the elder of two sons born to Thelma Catherine (née Wait) and Elton Egedeous Engstrom. His father moved to Juneau from Wrangell in 1928. The Engstrom family were involved in the fisheries business and in local politics in Wrangell, and the elder Engstrom would continue in both endeavors in Juneau. Engstrom served in the United States Army. He graduated from the University of Oregon and received his law degree from Harvard Law School. He worked in the family business, the Engstrom Brothers fish brokerage, and assumed management of the firm following his father's death in 1963. He was also in business in property management and retail arts sales. He was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 1964, serving a single term. In 1966, he was elected to the Alaska Senate, defeating Democratic incumbent Richard L. Peter. In 1968, Engstrom appeared statewide in television commercials endorsing Republican U.S. Senate nominee Elmer E. Rasmuson, emphasizing their shared views on fisheries issues. Engstrom would also serve only a single term as a senator, losing reelection in 1970 to Democrat Bill Ray. Elton Engstrom, Jr. married Sally Gray Hudson in 1963. Their oldest child and only daughter is Cathy Muñoz, who followed in his political footsteps. Muñoz served first on Juneau's city/borough assembly. After unsuccessfully challenging Juneau's state senator, Kim Elton, in 2002, she would be elected to the Alaska House in 2008 from a district centered on Juneau's Mendenhall Valley. Engstrom was also a prolific writer, with an emphasis on Alaska history. He wrote a column for the Juneau Empire for many years. With one of his sons, he wrote a biography of Alexander Baranof. He died in Juneau on November 6, 2013."

During his appointment Justice Bannister has handed down a number of decisions which have helped to reshape British Virgin Islands commercial law, including creating the jurisdiction for \"Black Swan\" orders and reformulating the basis for minority prejudice relief. Justice Bannister also heard the various first instance claims relating to the Bernie Madoff fraud claims in the British Virgin Islands. Justice Bannister is a relatively bold judge in terms of treatment of judicial precedent: \n*  In Zanotti v Interlog Finance Corp. he declined to follow the clear English common law rules set down in Exeter Football Club v Football Conference  (although Exeter was later overturned in United Kingdom in Fulham Football Club (1987) Ltd v Richard ). \n*  In Re C (a bankrupt), Justice Bannister partially overturned his own previous ruling in Picard v Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities LLC holding, with regret, that he now believed his earlier decision had been wrong in certain respects. \n*  In Nilon Limited v Royal Westminster Investments S.A. he once again declined to follow English Court of Appeal authority in Re Hoicrest Ltd and was again vindicated when the Privy Council adopted his approach and overruled Re Hoicrest. Bannister retired from his post in 2015."

  "text" : "Ernestine Huckleby, 8 years old, became the “face” of methylmercury poisoning in the early 1970s after her photograph was published in the 1971 National Geographic publication As We Live and Breathe: the Challenge of Our Environment. The iconic photograph of Ernestine, a young black girl with large staring eyes clutching her teddy bear, broke the heart of a nation. The photographer, James P. Blair, has said that “Of all the assignments I have had over the 35 years I was a staff photographer for the Society this was one of the saddest.” In 1969 in Alamogordo, New Mexico, Ernest Huckleby purchased grain from the Golden West Seed Company to feed his hogs. As part of his purchase he was also given some \"waste\" grain which included some seeds, dyed pink in warning, which had been treated with a mercuric fungicide. Unaware of the danger, Huckleby fed the mercury treated seed grain to a hog which he later slaughtered and fed to his wife, who was 3 months pregnant, and to his 7 children. Several of Huckleby’s hogs had appeared to be ill, and he believed that they were suffering from what farmers called the “blind staggers,” but the hog he fed to his family had appeared unaffected. Within 3 months the children had developed “ataxia, agitation, visual impairment, and impaired consciousness.” When born, baby Michael was severely neurologically impaired, blind, subject to convulsive seizures, and only minimally aware of his environment. Ernestine, 8 years old, became blind, unable to sit unsupported or to roll over, unable to hold objects, incontinent and unable to speak. Amos, 13 years old, became functionally blind, with sensory degradation and impaired coordination. Dorothy Jean Huckleby, 20 years old, suffered from tunnel vision, slurred speech, impaired coordination and numbness and tingling in her extremities. Mr. and Mrs. Huckleby were unaffected, which corresponds well with current medical findings that methylmercury is more dangerous to the developing nervous system of infants and children, but, for reasons the doctors did not understand, 4 of the Huckleby’s 8 children—all of whom shared the meal—were unaffected. Of the 4 that were affected, Dorothy Jean and Amos were hospitalized in a rehabilitation center in Roswell, New Mexico for 18 months. When placed in the facility, Dorothy had not been able to stand or use her arms or legs, she had no control over her bowels and bladder, and was unable to speak. After 18 months in the facility she had regained most of her function, a recovery her doctors and the press lauded as “miraculous.” At release, Amos was blind, confined to a wheelchair, and could speak only with difficulty. Baby Michael was born blind and seriously mentally and physically impaired, and remained so. Ernestine was placed in Gerald Champion Memorial Hospital in Alamogardo, where she remained in a coma for more than a year. When she emerged from the coma, she was blind, with severe physical disability, and it was reported that “She may never understand what has happened to her.” Dorothy Jean later sued the Federal government alleging the government was negligent in oversight of the warning label on the treated seed as the label was insufficient to apprise the Golden West Seed Company of the possibility of food-chain poisoning. She was unsuccessful. The judge expressed his regret that in following the law, he was not able to reach a finding in Dorothy Jean’s favor. Most countries had restricted the use of organic mercurial fungicides in reaction to similar poisonings, but legal maneuvers stalled the de-registration of organo-mercurial fungicides in the United States, and it continued to be used as a seed treatment for some time. That use was still ongoing at least 10 years later as evidenced by the experience of a Yakima, Washington family whose home flock of chickens was contaminated through feeding of seed grain treated with a mercurial fungicide. Ernestine, who had been 8 years old when she was poisoned, suffered from quadriplegia, blindness, and severe mental retardation until her death at the age of 30. An autopsy conducted showed cortical atrophy, neuronal loss, and gliosis, most pronounced in the paracentral and parietooccipital regions. Massive amounts of inorganic mercury were discovered in her brain, a fact which led researchers to conclude \"Since inorganic mercury crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, biotransformation of methyl to inorganic mercury may have occurred after methylmercury crossed the blood-brain barrier, accounting for its persistence in brain and causing part of the brain damage.”"

  "text" : "Elizabeth Meader Hanson (September 17, 1684—c.1737) was a colonial Anglo-American woman from Dover, New Hampshire, who survived Native American Abenaki capture and captivity in the year 1725 alongside four of her children. Five months after capture, a French family ransomed Elizabeth and her two children in Canada. Her husband was then able to secure them and find another daughter before having to return home, leaving the eldest daughter, Sarah, behind. Elizabeth's captivity narrative became popular because of its detailed insights into Native American captivity, which was a threat to the people in New England due to the almost constant wars with the Native Americans and French in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Her religious take on her experiences was heavily emphasized in her story."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Wilson (c.1762 – January 3, 1786) was an American whose execution by hanging for the purported murder of her children in southeastern Pennsylvania during the immediate post-Revolutionary War period made her a folklore figure in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Although her responsibility for the children's deaths had not been definitively established, the hanging was carried out and a pardon, granted by the state and entrusted to her brother, William, was not delivered in time to stop the execution. There was tremendous popular interest in her story, which quickly evolved into a tale of moral failing and divine redemption. Following his sister's death, William became a recluse, popularly known as The Pennsylvania Hermit. In some sources, William and Elizabeth are referred to as Amos Wilson and Harriot Wilson. However, the historical record leaves no doubt that the Hermit and his sister were named William and Elizabeth. The origin of these \"alternate\" names has never been fully explained. Many key elements of the Wilsons' saga are documented in the records of the Chester County Courts and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. However, the story quickly became a part of local folklore and was embellished by generations of storytellers. It is possible to note which elements of the tale are a part of the historical record and which might be considered suspect. However, \"the Wilson Story\" might best be considered historical fiction, as the popular tale incorporates elements of both, and even scholarly discussions of the events are at odds regarding certain details. The following is a synthesis of numerous, often conflicting sources and is best regarded as historical fiction."

Between 1654 and 1660, she served as överhovmästarinna to the Queen Hedwig Eleonora. In 1660, she married the noble and courtier Balthasar Marschalck.

Combes was Secretary for Public Works in the Robertson Ministry from August to December 1877, and in the following year was appointed Executive Commissioner for New South Wales at the Paris International Exhibition, his seat in Parliament being declared vacant by reason of his acceptance of an office of emolument under the Crown. For his services at Paris and his successful management of the New South Wales Court he was created C.M.G. and an officer of the Legion of Honour. Mr. Combes, who married a daughter of the late William C. Hare, is a member of the Institution of French Civil Engineers, and an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers of London. He is also an artist of considerable merit, and has exhibited with success at some of the leading London picture galleries.

  "text" : "Edward Costley (1794 – 18 April 1883) was a New Zealand philanthropist. Costley was born in Ireland to John and Anne Costley. Costley was known among the \"old identities\" of Auckland as a man of rather penurious and retiring habits, who had acquired property in the early days, which, with the growth of the city, had become of great value. Costley had arrived in Auckland around 1840, possibly coming on from Australia. He purchased property at a time when it was empty scrubland and as the town of Auckland grew he quietly expanded his landholdings. He never owned his own house preferring to board with friends, a married couple. On his deathbed he summoned his lawyer, and directed him to divide his wealth among the city charities, seven of these being named. The estate realised £93,000, which was divided between the Auckland Hospital, Old Men's Home, Sailors' Home, Auckland Institute, Costley Training Institute, Auckland Public Library, and the Parnell Orphan Home, each of which received £12,500. Smaller bequests were made to a range of other charities in Auckland including various organisations run by different religions. It is possibly significant that money was spread across a number of the various religious denominations including homes run by the Anglican and Catholic Churches and inner city Missions and shelters administerd by the Methodists and others. One institution was created by the Costley Trust, apparently on the specific instruction of Edward Costley. A Training School for Boys was built on Richmond Road in Grey Lynn to educate working class boys in manual trades. This building is now known as Carlile House and is in a state of disrepair. Since Costley's death an unsigned draft will has come to light which showed that he had long contemplated the application of his wealth to charitable purposes. He died in Auckland on 18 April 1883, and was buried at Symonds Street Cemetery where the Costley Trust erected a monument to his memory. This monument stands to the North of the Anglican Memorial on the eastern side of the cemetery."

Farah lived in Lebanon for a number of years, and later moved to Iraq where he became the director of the Baath party academy. He returned to his native Syria in 2003, and settled in the capital Damascus. Because of the Civil War in Syria, Farah moved to Dubai in April 2013 where he died on December 6th, 2013 at the age of 86.

  "text" : "Esther Streit-Wurzel (Hebrew: אֶסְתֵּר שְטְרייט-ווֹרְצֶל‎‎; July 25, 1932 − December 7, 2013) was an Israeli children's author and educator. Streit-Wurzel was born in Petach Tikva, Central District, in then Mandatory Palestine. She wrote her first book in 1944, at age 12, under the pen name Zvi Hadas as she was too shy to credit herself with her work. She graduated from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1949, at age 17. Apart from writing, she was also an educator. Esther Streit-Wurzel died following a serious illness on 7 December 2013, aged 81, in Petach Tikva, Central District, Israel. Her funeral took place the next day on 8 December and was attended by thousands. She was survived by her husband and three children."

Following studies in medicine and natural sciences, he obtained his PhD from the University of Strasbourg in 1902. In 1913–14 he conducted zoological research in central and north-eastern Brazil, later being named director of zoology at the Georg-Speyer-Haus in Frankfurt am Main (1919). From 1925 to 1933, he was a professor at the University of Cologne, where he was instrumental in the founding of its institute of zoology. In 1934 he returned to Brazil as director of the zoological institute at the University of São Paulo. His primary areas of research involved the evolutionary development of flatworms, investigations of infusoria and the development of mammary organs in marsupials. His name is associated with Bachia bresslaui, sometimes referred to as \"Bresslau's bachia\", a species of Brazilian lizard described by Afrânio Pompílio Gastos do Amaral in 1935."

He was the member for Victoria in the South Australian House of Assembly from December 1871 to May 1873, and served as Commissioner of Crown Lands in the Henry Ayers Ministry from 22 January to 4 March 1872. He was forced to resign his seat after a series of financial problems. He unsuccessfully contested the seat of Gumeracha in 1887. For many years, Derrington was connected with journalism in Victoria and South Australia; he was owner-editor of the Mount Gambier Standard from around 1869 to 1872. He then moved to Moonta, where he founded and ran the Yorke's Peninsula Advertiser and Miners' News for eleven years. He acquired the Port Adelaide News in 1878 and was its owner-editor until 1883. He purchased the Adelaide Punch from J. C. F. Johnson in 1881, but had no success with the venture; he disposed of it in 1884 and it folded shortly after. He resided at Kensington, South Australia."

  "text" : "Edgar E. Peters (born 1952), is an asset manager and writer on investment management topics. He is noted for his early contributions to the application of chaos theory and fractals to the financial markets. These works primarily dealt with fat tailed distributions originally discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot and expanded upon in Peters (1991 and 1994). These probability distributions are considered fractal because they are self-similar over different investment horizons once adjusted for scale. Peters worked as an asset manager for PanAgora Asset Management, Inc., during which time he researched rescaled range analysis, and attempted to estimate the Hurst exponent of various financial markets. He has also taught at Babson College, Boston College and Bentley College, and contributed papers to the Journal of Portfolio Management and the Financial Analysts Journal. He now works at First Quadrant LLP in California. His books include Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets (According to WorldCat, the book is held in 659 libraries,) Fractal Market Analysis (held in 485 libraries) andPatterns in the Dark: Understanding Risk and Financial Crisis with Complexity Theory. According to Google Scholar his books and articles have over 3000 references. His best known contribution is the Fractal Market Hypothesis (FMH) which was outlined in Peters (1994). Recent research has supported the FMH as well describing the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 as well as Tech Bubble of 2000. The FMH is a model of investor behavior that unlike the Efficient Market Hypothesis assumes investors have multiple time horizons and interpret information based upon their horizon. More recently he has contributed to the risk parity literature."

  "text" : "Eduard Weyr (June 22, 1852 – July 23, 1903) was a Czech mathematician now chiefly remembered as the discoverer of a certain canonical form for square matrices over algebraically closed fields. Weyr presented this form briefly in a paper published in 1885. He followed it up with a more elaborate treatment in a paper published in 1890. This particular canonical form has been named as the Weyr canonical form in a paper by Shapiro published in The American Mathematical Monthly in 1999. Previously, this form has been variously called as modified Jordan form, reordered Jordan form, second Jordan form, and H-form. Eduard's father was a mathematician at a secondary school in Prague, and Eduard's older brother Emil Weyr was also a mathematician. Eduard studied at Prague Polytechnic and Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague. He received his doctorate from Göttingen in 1873 with dissertation Über algebraische Raumcurven. After a short spell in Paris studying under Hermite and Serret, he returned to Prague where he eventually became a professor at Charles-Ferdinand University. Eduard also published research in geometry, in particular projective and differential geometry. In 1983 in Chicago, his paper Sur l'équation des lignes géodésiques was read (but not by him) at the International Mathematical Congress held in connection with the World's Columbian Exposition."

She was given the nickname ET because of her resemblance to E.T. in the American film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. E Thi is physically disabled, blind and has a speech impediment, which requires her sister, Thi Thi Win, to translate her predictions. On 23 July 2012, Kantana, a Thai film company held a press conference in Bangkok to announce a biopic on E Thi's life. The screenplay is based on a script written by Si Phyo Tun, E Thi's nephew. The eight episode television series, titled Extraordinary Gift, is directed by Thai film director Nirattisai Kaljaruek and will air on two Thai television channels. Nititar Chawpayark was cast as E Thi. E Thi's sister, Thi Thi Win, owns Ever Top Production company, which is cooperating with Kantana for the production.

  "text" : "Ethan Anthony Couch (born April 11, 1997) is an American man who killed four people while drinking and driving on June 15, 2013, in Burleson, Texas. He was intoxicated, illegally driving on a restricted license and speeding, lost control, plowed into a group of people standing near a disabled SUV and struck a parked vehicle, which was there to assist. Four people were killed in the collision; two passengers in Couch's truck suffered serious bodily injury and a total of nine people were injured. Couch was indicted on four counts of intoxication manslaughter for recklessly driving under the influence. In December 2013, Judge Jean Hudson Boyd sentenced Couch to ten years of probation and subsequently ordered him to therapy at a long-term in-patient facility, after his attorneys argued that the teen had affluenza and needed rehabilitation instead of prison. Couch's sentence, believed by many to be incredibly lenient, set off what The New York Times called \"an emotional, angry debate that has stretched far beyond the North Texas suburbs\". Couch became the subject of a manhunt and was listed in the National Fugitive Database on December 11, 2015, after his probation officer was unable to contact him. On December 28, 2015, authorities detained Couch and his mother in the Mexican resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. On April 13, 2016, he was sentenced to serve two years in jail."

His mother died at his birth and he was of delicate constitution all his life. His father was sufficiently well off to send him to winter in the warmer climate of Italy. He attended horticultual college in Potsdam and later worked at the municipal gardens in Berlin. In 1874 he began work as a gardener in the nursery of Louis van Houtte in Ghent. Around 1880, he visited Samoa, Tonga, the Marshall and Caroline Islands. From his travels in the South Seas, he issued two papers on flora native to the islands. Ferns collected in the islands where shipped to the University of Leipzig, and the rest of the specimens were given to botanist Ferdinand von Mueller. In September 1881 he was hired as a collector at the Sydney Botanical Gardens in New South Wales. In March 1897, he became a botanical assistant to Joseph Maiden. In Australia, he distinguished himself in the field of botanical systematics. The botanical genus Betchea (family Cunoniaceae) was named in his honor by Rudolf Schlechter."

Chaloner was appointed consultant vascular surgeon at University College Hospitals London in 2002. He currently holds an NHS post as a consultant vascular surgeon at Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust and runs a private practice Radiance Health, which operates from several hospitals run by BMI Healthcare. Chaloner pioneered endovenous laser surgery treatment for varicose veins in the UK, which has revolutionised the treatment of this common condition worldwide. In 2003 he was the first surgeon in London and the South of England to use laser surgery to treat veins, four years after endovenous surgery had been introduced into the UK by Mark Whiteley. He frequently lectures and teaches on the subject of minimally invasive vein surgery and is a faculty member on a variety of training programmes including for the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Charing Cross International Vascular Symposium and the Venous Forum of the Royal Society of Medicine. He is also a member of the Vascular Society and of the Royal Society of Medicine. In 2010, Chaloner became the first surgeon in the UK to use the Clarivein treatment for varicose veins to achieve sealing of saphenous vein reflux by an injection free technique. He continues to research in this field. Chaloner took part in the British TV programme The Choir: Sing While You Work on BBC Two in 2012. As a member of The Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir, he also sang in “A Bridge Over You”, a charity single released in December 2013 to raise funds for Macmillan Cancer Support and other local healthcare charities."

In 1930 he left in his final year without graduating, but with his father's approval. He went to work on pipeline construction. Then in 1932 he moved on work on the Boulder Dam. Here he started as a shovel foreman before being promoted to superintendent of canyon excavation. He then moved on to working on the Bonneville Dam. In 1941 Edgar was appointed Vice-President and General Manager of Kaiser Shipyards responsible for building ships from prefabricated parts in the context of the Second World War. In 1947, he was appointed General Manager of the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation which was where his father's corporation produced cars. Kaiser received the Award of Excellence from Engineering News-Record for his service under President Lyndon Johnson on the Committee on Urban Housing. His work on this committee to increase the availability of housing for low- and moderate-income families earned him the Medal of Freedom."

  "text" : "Sir Edward Ridley PC QC/KC ( August 1843 - 14 October 1928) was a British barrister, judge and Conservative Politician, MP for South Northumberland from 1878–80. He was the son of Sir Matthew White Ridley, 4th Baronet, and his wife Cecilia Ann, eldest daughter of Sir James Parke, afterwards Baron Wensleydale. His brother was Matthew White Ridley, 1st Viscount Ridley. He was educated at Harrow and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, 1866–1882. He married Alice Davenport, daughter of William Bromley Davenport, of Cheshire. They had two sons, the younger was Guy Ridley. He was a barrister 1868, QC 1892 and Knighted (Knight Bachelor) in 1897. Giving the Plymouth Law Society’s Annual Pilgrim Fathers Lecture in December 2009, Lord Justice Toulson recounted that Ridley’s appointment to the High Court bench in 1897 had been “greeted with horror” and that The Law Times had written “no-one will believe that he would have been appointed to the High Court Bench but for his connections. […] Such an innovation, we repeat, was only possible where the hard-working official, the bearer of so many heavy burdens of the High Court judges, was highly connected. This is Ridleyism. Let it be known hereafter as Ridleyism […]”. Toulson further noted that Ridley’s appointment had been described by The Solicitors’ Journal as “a grave mistake” and that on Ridley’s death Sir Frederick Pollock had written: “Sir E. Ridley, good scholar, Fellow of All Souls, successful, sicut dicunt [so they say], as an Official Referee, and by general opinion of the Bar the worst High Court judge of our time, ill-tempered and grossly unfair: which is rather a mystery”. Lord Justice MacKinnon called Ridley “the worst judge I have appeared before”, saying that “he had a perverse instinct for unfairness”."

While also teaching at Cornell Medical College, he was medical director of the Russell Sage Institute of Pathology from 1911 until he retired. During World War II, DuBois was a captain in the United States Naval Reserve, where he taught gas warfare training and defense, aviation medicine, and deep diving and submarine ventilation. Before the advent of nuclear powered submarines, DuBois spent 96 hours submerged, the record for the time. DuBois mapped out basal metabolism for aging men, which he published in 1916. The Aub-DuBois table is still in use today. He was most proud of the concept, worked out with David P. Barr, that the body can give off as much heat with a cool skin as with warm skin. DuBois thought his \"chief contribution was popularizing the simple, fundamental principles of metabolism in disease so that they eventually found their way into the textbooks and habits of thought.\""

  "text" : "Edward Angus Hamilton (born 27 February 1831) was an architect and politician in colonial South Australia. Hamilton was the son of George Ernest Hamilton, a civil engineer, and arrived in South Australia on 5 December 1849. In April 1852 he began Government service at the Assay Office, where remained until June 1853. Hamilton was then appointed Assistant to the Colonial Architect, William Bennett Hays. By January 1854 he had been appointed Assistant Architect in the Colonial Architect's Office. When Hays left for England towards the end of 1854, Hamilton was placed in charge. On 10 July 1856 Hamilton was appointed Colonial Architect and Supervisor of Works with a salary of £450 per annum and a £112 gratuity. Hamilton married Ellen Seymour in 1856. Hamilton resigned as colonial architect around August 1860. Hamilton and his father were involved in constructing the Kadina to Wallaroo railway, completed in 1866. Their partnership was dissolved later in 1866 when George was appointed to the Strathalbyn and Middleton Railway and Edward joined the architectural firm of Wright & Woods, which he left in 1868 to become second-in-charge of the Colonial Architect's Department. Hamilton was elected a member of the South Australian House of Assembly for the District of Light on 5 April 1870, served as Treasurer of South Australia from 12 May 1870 to 30 May 1870 and resigned a year later, unmourned, on 28 July 1871. and reportedly left the Colony for South America."

  "text" : "Elin Andersdotter (died 1569), was a Swedish courtier. She served as hovmästarinna to queen Karin Månsdotter of Sweden. She is known for being a leading actor in a plot to free and reinstate the imprisoned and deposed king Erik XIV of Sweden. Elin Andersdotter was reportedly the widow of a certain Gerdt Svärdfejare from Vadstena, and remarried at an unknown time to a man by the name Hans Andersson. She is first mentioned as a part of the staff of the royal mistress Karin Månsdotter in 1566. Described as a loyal servant, she received several gifts from Karin. When Karin Månsdotter became queen, Elin Andersdotter was named mistress of the Robes. This was an unusual position for a commoner, but the court appointed to Karin Månsdotter, herself originally a commoner, when she became queen, was quite small, smaller than those of her royal sisters-in-law and mainly consisting of her former staff of commoners. In 1568, Erik XIV was deposed and imprisoned alongside Karin Månsdotter, who was however allowed to keep her staff. In the summer of 1569, a plot was discovered with the intent to free and reinstate Erik XIV. The plan was the ship owner Per Larsson would fire at the city of Stockholm, and that the former monarch should be able to flee from his prison in the royal palace during the confusion. He would then be reinstated upon the throne. The conspirators consisted of members of the staff of the former royal couple Erik XIV and Karin Månsdotter: the secretary and mistress of the robes of Karin, Thomas Jakobsson and Elin Andersdotter; the ship owners Per Larsson and Frans Klementsson; the chaplain Jon, Per Pålsson and the spouse of Elin Andersdotter; Hans Andersson. Elin Andersdotter was, alongside Thomas Jakobsson, the leader of the conspiracy, and financed the whole affair. The conspirators held their conferences at the home of Jakobsson, who also handled the correspondence with Erik XIV, who was informed about the plot. It is unknown whether Karin Månsdotter was informed of the plot or participated in it. During the trials against the conspirators, Andersdotter and Jakobsson were interrogated about the alleged hidden treasure that John III was certain had been hidden away by Erik XIV, and were promised a pardon if they helped recover it. But they revealed nothing, if indeed there had been such a treasure at all. Elin Andersdotter was found guilty of conspiring to overthrow the monarch. Alongside Thomas Jakobsson, she was executed as the main instigator of the plot."

Elma Johnson was born in Memphis, Tennessee on March 15, 1907. She attended Manassas High School in Memphis and obtained her teacher's certificate from Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee. She worked as a teacher and ran a nursery school in rural Tennessee before moving to Chicago in 1945, where she was a supervisor for the Illinois Department of Labor. The granddaughter of slaves, Stuckey authored two books of poetry late in her life. Her first collection, The Big Gate, was published in 1976, and The Collected Poems of Elma Stuckey was published in 1987. As a poet, Stuckey first gained attention by reading her works on Studs Terkel's WFMT radio program. She also read at Harvard, Cornell and Stanford Universities as well as the University of California at Berkeley. Stuckey had two children, Delois Jean Stuckey Morrison and historian Sterling Stuckey. She died on September 25, 1988 during a visit to Washington, D.C. where she was scheduled to record readings of her poetry for the Smithsonian Institution."

  "text" : "Ephraim Engleman (March 24, 1911 – September 2, 2015) was an American rheumatologist and a Clinical Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.He had a major national and international impact on rheumatology during more than six decades, and wrote more than one hundred scientific and medical papers. Dr. Engleman received his B.S. from Stanford University in 1933 and his M.D. from Columbia University in 1937. He saw military service as a major during World War II, serving as chief of the U.S. Army’s Rheumatic Fever Center at Torney General Hospital. In 1942, he was one of two authors of the first English language medical article describing the triad of uveitis, urethritis, and arthritis and coined the eponym Reiter's syndrome after Dr. Hans Conrad Julius Reiter. In 1947, he joined the clinical faculty at UCSF and spent the remaining 68 years of his professional medical career there, with a national and international impact on the field of rheumatology. From 1962-1963, Dr. Engleman was president of the American Rheumatism Association, now the American College of Rheumatology; president of the National Society of Clinical Rheumatology (1967-1969); president of the International League Against Rheumatism (1981-1985). In the latter position, he made several trips to mainland China and was influential in the creation of the Chinese Rheumatology Association. He also served as Chairman of the World Health Organization’s task force on arthritis and on several committees of the Natural Institutes of Health. From 1975 to 1976, Dr. Engleman chaired the National Commission on Arthritis, a congressional mandated task force charged with recommending remedies for the inadequate status of arthritis research, teaching and patient care in the United States. The National Arthritis Plan, which summarized the commission’s recommendations, most of which were implemented, included the creation of what is now the National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, and tripling of the ongoing federal budget for arthritis research. It also called attention to the surprising number of medical schools with no curriculum in rheumatology – a situation that changed quickly after the plan’s publication. In 1979, Dr. Engleman became Founding Director of the Rosalind Russell Medical Research Center for Arthritis at UCSF. Its name has since changed, Dr. Engleman served as the Director of the Rosalind Russell/Ephraim P. Engleman Rheumatology Research Center at UCSF until his death in 2015. Some of Dr. Engelman’s additional honors are recipient of the Medal of Honor at UCSF in 2002, “the most prestigious award given by UCSF”; recipient of the Presidential Gold Medal Award of the American College of Rheumatology, the highest national honor in the field of rheumatology; and recipient of Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons Gold Medal for excellence in clinical medicine in 2007, the highest honor the school’s alumni association can bestow. In 2007, while still practicing rheumatology and after Dr. Reiter's Nazi past became more widely known, Dr. Engleman went on record as calling for a replacement of the eponymous term for the disease with the name \"reactive arthritis.\" Engleman wrote a book of memoirs, My Century. Active until his death, he was the longest tenured professor of UCSF as of December 30, 2013. In January 2013, he was believed to be the lone surviving member of Stanford University's Class of 1933. Engleman died at the age of 104 on September 2, 2015 while at work as director of the Rosalind Russell/Ephraim P. Engleman Rheumatology Research Center at UCSF, which had been renamed in his honor the previous year. Engleman was survived by his two sons, daughter Jill Roost, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren."

Pak described the journal as \"the primary literary force in Hawaii today\", and it received the Hawaii Award for Literature in 1996 from the Hawaii Literary Arts Council. The success and influence of the Bamboo Ridge group of writers, among whom Chock himself was included, was later examined in detail by literary critic Rob Wilson in his study Reimagining the American Pacific. Chock has also edited several anthologies featuring Hawaiian writers, as well as Small Kid Time Hawaii and Haku Mele o Hawaii, two collections of children's poetry.

Along with Lew Hayman and Léo Dandurand, Cradock co-founded the original Montreal Alouettes in 1946. The team quickly gained respectability, winning the Grey Cup in 1949. Cradock had a flair for showmanship and was successful in attracting paying customers. Cradock sold his shares in the Alouettes for profit in 1952 and returned to Toronto. In the mid-1950s he angled to take control of Toronto Argonauts from the Argonaut Rowing Club. In 1956 he joined another ownership trio, this time with John Bassett and Charlie Burns, and became co-owner of the club. Cradock brought back old friend Hayman to run the club. He had sold out by 1960, apparently over differences with Bassett. Football was not his only avenue of sports entrepreneurship. In 1946, while also founding the Alouettes, he was co-owner of the short-lived Toronto Huskies of the Basketball Association of America. The team folded after just one year."

Langton was born in Gravesend, Kent, England, the youngest son of David Elland Langton, a butcher, and his wife Mary, née Payne. Langton migrated to Melbourne in 1852, aged 24, becoming involved in politics in the late 1850s.Langton unsuccessfully contested the Victorian Legislative Assembly seats of Collingwood in 1859 and 1861, East Melbourne in 1861, East Bourke Boroughs in 1864, and Dundas in 1865. Langton eventually had electoral success and represented East Melbourne from February 1866 until December 1867. Then from May 1868 to April 1877 he represented West Melbourne. On 6 May 1868 Langton, who was a staunch Conservative as well as a Free-trader, became Treasurer of Victoria in Charles Sladen's short-lived Ministry, and occupied the same post, with the additional office of Postmaster-General of Victoria, in the James Francis Government, from 10 June 1872 to 31 July 1874, when he resigned with his colleagues. Langton has written much for the Melbourne press, and was one of the earliest proprietors of the Spectator, a free trade organ started in 1865. He was secretary of the Free Trade League of Victoria from its commencement until 1866, was an honorary member of the Cobden Club from 1874, and was a trustee and treasurer of the Melbourne Public Library and Museum. Langton was again unsuccessful in contesting Castlemaine February 1880, West Melbourne in 1886, Toorak in 1892 and 1894, and East Melbourne in 1897. Langton died of pneumonia on 5 October 1905 in his home in Toorak, Victoria;survived by a daughter and one of his two sons."

  "text" : "Emily Dix (21 May 1904 – 1972) was a famous palaeobotanist. She was born into a farming family on the Gower Peninsula. At age 18 she won a scholarship to University College Swansea where she graduated in 1925 with a first class honours degree in geology. She then went on to study with Arthur Trueman, with whom she worked for the next five years on various projects. In 1930, she was appointed lecturer in geology at Bedford College in London, where she stayed for the rest of her working life. Her initial work, following that of Truman, was on non-marine bivalves in the South Wales Coalfield. This remained an interest throughout her working life. Dix's major contribution was to apply Trueman's approach to biostratigraphy to the floras. World war II came at the height of her career, and disrupted her scientific activities. Along with the rest of Bedford College, she was evacuated to Cambridge, leaving behind her collections of fossils and scientific reprints which was later lost through bombing. Most of her fossils survived and her collection is now divided between the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, and the National Museum of Wales, and the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge. Dix's wartime papers were mainly on relatively minor aspects of coal geology (e.g. the presence of boulders in coal seams) and plant biostratigraphy is rarely mentioned. Towards the end of the war, Dix suffered a mental breakdown which caused the end of her scientific career. By 1946, her condition had so deteriorated that her sister Margaret had taken over her affairs, and moved Emily to The Retreat mental hospital in York, where she remained until her death."

  "text" : "Eduardo Alvarez (born January 30, 1990) is an American short track speed skater who presented the United States at the 2014 Winter Olympics and professional baseball player. The son of Cuban immigrants, Alvarez grew up in Miami, Florida. He took up roller skating at age five, performing on the beach. He began ice speed skating at age seven, and at eleven he won national age-level titles in inline, long track, and short track speed skating. In high school, Alvarez took a break from skating to concentrate on his other love – baseball. He played well enough to earn a college scholarship, but instead quit the sport to pursue his Olympic dream. Alvarez made the 2008 and 2009 World Junior Short Track Speed Skating Championships, winning a gold medal in 2009. After missing the 2010 Olympics, he returned to baseball in an attempt to give his knees a break after years of chronic pain. He became an All-Conference shortstop, but his knees did not improve. In early 2012, Alvarez underwent surgery to repair badly torn patellar tendons that left him completely immobile for four weeks. He returned to the National Team in July, but was too weak to navigate stairs, let alone skate competitively. After intense physical therapy, Alvarez made the United States' World Cup Team in December 2012. He finished the season as the country's third highest ranked skater. During the 2013–14 World Cup season, Alvarez won three medals. At the 2014 Olympic Trials, he placed second in the 500 meters, second in the 1500 meters, and third in the 1000 meters. The performance made him the first Cuban-American male speed skater to make a U.S. Olympic team. At the Olympics, he won a silver medal in the 5000 meter relay after failing to medal in his three individual events. Prior to the Olympics, Alvarez said he planned to give up speed skating after the Games to concentrate on baseball."

In February 2012, Quinn gunned down Raul Bennett Sambola in their mutual home town of Bluefields following a family feud. After spending a year on the run, Quinn was finally arrested in April 2013.

  "text" : "Lenin's father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, was the fourth child of impoverished tailor Nikolai Vassilievich Ulyanov (born a serf father); and a far younger woman named Anna Alexeevna Smirnova, who lived in Astrakhan. Ilya was of partly Kalmyk descent. Ilya escaped poverty by studying physics and mathematics at the Kazan State University, before teaching at the Penza Institute for the Nobility from 1854. Introduced to Maria Alexandrovna Blank, they married in the summer of 1863. From a relatively prosperous background, Maria was the daughter of a Russian Jewish physician, Alexander Dmitrievich Blank, and his German-Swedish wife, Anna Ivanovna Grosschopf, who was the daughter of a wealthy Lutheran family from Germany. Alexander Blank was the son of Moishe Blank, a Jewish merchant from Volhynia, and his Swedish wife Anna Ostedt. Dr. Blank had insisted on providing his children with a good education, ensuring that Maria learned Russian, German, English and French, and that she was well versed in Russian literature. Soon after their wedding, Ilya obtained a job in Nizhni Novgorod, rising to become Inspector of Primary Schools in the Simbirsk district six years later. Five years after that, he was promoted to Director of Public Schools for the province, overseeing the foundation of over 450 schools as a part of the government's plans for modernisation. Awarded the Order of St. Vladimir, he became a hereditary nobleman. With it he gained the right to be addressed as \"Your Excellency\". Lenin's Jewish ancestry was concealed by the Soviet authorities, despite an appeal in the form of a letter from his sister Anna to Josef Stalin in 1932, where she remarked that this fact could be used to combat antisemitism; Stalin's reaction was that not one word was to be told of this letter. The couple, now nobility, had two children, Anna (born 1864) and Alexander (born 1866) before the birth of their third child, Vladimir \"Volodya\" Ilyich (Russian: Владимир Ильич Ульянов), on 22 April 1870, baptised in St. Nicholas Cathedral several days later. They would be followed by three more children, Olga (born 1871), Dmitry (born 1874) and Maria (born 1878). Another brother, Nikolai, had died several days after birth in 1873. Ilya was a devout member of the Russian Orthodox Church and baptised his children into it, although Maria – a Lutheran – was largely indifferent to Christianity, a view that influenced her children. Both parents were monarchists and liberal conservatives, being committed to the Emancipation reform of 1861 introduced by the reformist Tsar Alexander II; they avoided political radicals and there is no evidence that the police ever put them under surveillance for subversive thought. The claim that Ilya exerted a revolutionary influence on his children is considered a myth. According to Lenin's sister Anna, he was a \"religious man\", a great admirer of the reforms of Tsar Alexander II of the 1860s, and \"that he saw it as his job to protect the youth from radicalism.\" Every summer they left their home in Moscow Street, Simbirsk and holidayed at a rural manor in Kokushkino, shared with Maria's Veretennikov cousins. Among his siblings, Vladimir was closest to his sister Olya, whom he bossed around, having an extremely competitive nature; he could be destructive, but usually admitted misbehaviour. A keen sportsman, he spent much of his free time outdoors or playing chess, but his father insisted that he devote his life to study, leading him to excel at school, the Simbirsk Classical Gimnazia, a disciplinarian and conservative institution. By his teenage years, Vladimir was coaching his elder sister in Latin and gave private tuition to a Chuvash student. Vladimir was also fond of the Blank estate, a place he spent a lot of time at in his youth; in his youth he was proud to describe himself as the son of a squire; and he once signed himself as \"Hereditary Nobleman Vladimir Ulyanov\" before the police. This noble background was noticed by many, among them the writer Maxim Gorky, and is said to have greatly influenced his personality. Ilya Ulyanov died of a brain haemorrhage on 12 January 1886, when Vladimir was 16 years old. Vladimir's behaviour became erratic and confrontational, and shortly thereafter he renounced his belief in God. At the time, Vladimir's elder brother Aleksandr \"Sacha\" Ulyanov was studying biology at Saint Petersburg University, in 1885 having been awarded a gold medal for his dissertation, after which he was elected onto the university's Scientific-Literary Society. Involved in political agitation against the absolute monarchy of reactionary Tsar Alexander III which governed the Russian Empire, he studied the writings of banned leftists like Dmitry Pisarev, Nikolay Dobrolyubov, Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Karl Marx. Organising protests against the government, he joined a socialist revolutionary cell bent on assassinating the Tsar and was selected to construct a bomb. Before the attack commenced, the conspirators were arrested and tried. On 25 April 1887, Sacha was sentenced to death by hanging, and executed on 8 May. Despite the emotional trauma brought on by his father and brother's deaths, Vladimir continued studying, leaving school with a gold medal for his exceptional performance, and decided to study law at Kazan University. Lenin's headmaster at the gymnasium was Fedor Kerensky, the father of what would later become his arch-rival in 1917, Alexander. During his last year at the gymnasium in 1887, Kerensky wrote a report on Vladimir, describing him as a \"model student, never 'giving cause for dissatisfaction, by word or by deed, to the school authorities'\". Kerensky put this down to his moral upbringing, writing that \"religion and discipline were the basis of his upbringing, the fruits of which are apparent in Ul'ianov's behavior\". At this point there were many indications that he would create an established career in the Tsarist bureaucracy, following in the footsteps of his father."

Norton practiced a style of criticism known as \"play doctoring\", where he made suggestions on how to improve a show. Boston was a major pre-Broadway tryout town, and Elliot's criticism was taken seriously by producers, directors and playwrights, including Joshua Logan, Mike Nichols, and Neil Simon. Norton was called \"the most valuable critic in America\" by producer Alexander Cohen. According to Logan: Elliot had an absolute dead eye for a play. He could see it once and form an opinion that struck at the very core. He was very helpful to me on every show I brought to Boston. He had a gentlemanly manner, and even if what he had to say was rough, he could tell you without breaking your heart."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Florette Fisher (November 26, 1873 – April 25, 1941) was one of the first field geologists in the United States. Born in Boston, Massachusetts, she attended and later taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She was also the first woman to be sent out by an oil company for a survey, helping to locate oil wells in North-Central Texas during a nationwide oil shortage. During this same time, she not only continued her career as an instructor at Wellesley College, but also wrote an influential textbook for junior high students called Resources and Industries of the United States. She stressed the need for conservation, and believed \"unclaimed\" land should be used for agriculture. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Geographical Society, and also was a member of the Appalachian Mountain Club and the Boston Society of Natural History. She died in 1941 from illness. Currently, at Wellesley College, there is a scholarship in her name for women graduates of this institution who are planning on further study."

  "text" : "Eugeni Xammar i Puigventós (Barcelona, January 17, 1888 - L'Ametlla del Vallès, December 5, 1973) was an international journalist, career diplomat, and polyglot translator (he spoke seven languages and wrote five) who lived most of his life outside of Catalonia as a correspondent in Europe during the stormy, unstable years of the First and Second World Wars. He worked as a correspondent in Buenos Aires, Paris, Madrid, London, Berlin, Washington DC, and Geneva, and traveled to Italy, Russia, and Austria, among others. As a correspondent, he collaborated principally with Catalan media outlets, writing in Catalan, like La Publicitat, La Veu de Catalunya, or Mirador magazine, which he complemented with activities in Spanish in South American publications and the Madrid-based newspaper Ahora. His mastery of languages allowed him to work as a translator for international organizations like the UN, WHO, World Bank, and FAO. His longest assignment was in Berlin, between 1922 and 1936, during the Weimar Republic, when Xammar published in 1923 an alleged interview of Hitler, the first known such of the future Führer, in which he explains how he was incubating what he called \"the serpent's egg\". Eighty years later, the authenticity of this interview was called into question by Lluís Permanyer and Albert Sánchez Piñol. These are the years in which he coincided with Josep Pla who was also a correspondent and with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. From Berlin, he narrated the repercussions of the First World War on the German populace that led to the evolution of Nazism and Hitler's arrival to power. Always committed to the Republic and to the Government of the Generalitat de Catalunya, of which he was a representative in Paris during the postwar period under President Irla, his actions led to Francoist reprisals and extradition, as well as the disappearance of his name and his work for an entire generation of students until his posthumous memoir was published in the mid 1970s. Xammar defined himself as a democrat, Republican, and Catalanist. He stated: \"when it comes to Catalonia, I have never taken precautions\". He was very critical with those who, despite sharing positions like his own, considered themselves \"non-belligerents\" with the postwar Francoist regime, like for example the intellectuals who contributed to Destino magazine, despite it being a key liberal, Catalanist, democratic source of the times."

The announcement led to the British consul issuing a note of protest, which other than a brief acknowledgement from Argentina went unanswered. This combined with the Lexington raid of 1831, is considered to have prompted the British to send a small naval patrol to re-assert British sovereignty in the Falkland Islands. Arriving in October 1832, he was murdered in a mutiny the following month. There are few reliably known details of his early life and even the exact circumstances of his death are unclear."

  "text" : "Edward Frederick Leitner, also Friedrich August Ludwig Leitner (4 February 1812, Stuttgart – 15 January 1838, age 25) was a German botanist, naturalist and physician. At the age of four, his family moved to Schorndorf after the death of his father. Following studies of botany at the University of Tübingen, he moved to the United States after receiving a subsidy from the Society of Natural Sciences in Württemberg. In 1831 he began taking classes at the Medical College of South Carolina in Charleston. In 1833 collected botanical and zoological specimens in Florida, eventually reaching the Florida Keys, during which, he paid a visit to the Dry Tortugas. In 1834 he graduated from medical college with a dissertation on Hippomane mancinella, subsequently working as a lecturar at the South Carolina Medical Society. In 1836 he returned as a naturalist to the Florida Keys, where in Key West, he joined a military group as a guide and surgeon. On 15 January 1838, he was mortally wounded in a skirmish with Seminoles near Jupiter Inlet. After his death, 800 of his specimens eventually came into the possession of Jean Louis Cabanis, however these were completely destroyed during the bombing of Berlin in 1943. The genus Leitneria is named in his honor, as is the family Leitneriaceae, the latter taxa being circumscribed by George Bentham."

Hagen was born in Stockholm, Sweden and was the daughter of the priest and writer Bernhard Wadström, and married Roger Hagen, governor of Gävleborg country. She was the mother of ambassador Tord Hagen. She was active as a speaker for Country Association for Women's Suffrage. She is described as a skillful speaker, and her contribution was appreciated: by her connections, the movement gained supporters from the upper class, who would not otherwise be willing to listen to a speech about women suffrage, and by her glamorous way of dressing, she proved wrong the caricature of a suffragette as \"masculine\". Women suffrage was achieved in 1919. After the death of her spouse in 1922, she was proposed by the government to succeed him as governor of Gävleborg country, though this did not come about."

  "text" : "Amelia \"Emi\" Fontana (b. Milan, 1961) is a cultural producer, art curator and writer based in Los Angeles. Fontana studied art history at the University La Sapienza in Rome, with a focus on the Venetian Renaissance. Her coming of age happened in the late seventies when Italy was living a unique season of creativity and was a laboratory of new ideas and talents. She became part of circles of artists, musicians and writers. She was especially close to the group of writers and cartoonists involved with the publication of several independent magazines, including Il Male, Cannibale, and Frigidaire. As well as \"off theater\" avantgard experiences like the circle of the Beat 72 . In these years the young Emi Fontana met the well known cultural attaché for the city of Rome, Renato Nicolini. His ideas of bringing culture in to the streets trespassing boundaries of high and low that culminated with the Estate Romana (Roman Summer), became really influential for her later activity as cultural producer."

  "text" : "Evan Geiselman (born August 31, 1993 in New Smyrna Beach, Florida) has been a competing surfer since the age of seven. He has won 12 East Coast Championship titles. He is the younger brother of professional surfer Eric Geiselman.  He has been trying to be part of the ASP World Championship Tour for three years now, but the Qualification Series are competitive. He didn't get the results he was hoping for on the 2014 WQS.  At the beginning of 2014, he moved from San Clemente, California back home, to New Smyrna Beach, Florida. In March of 2008, Geiselman started competing in surf competitions at the NSSA East Coast Nationals at Florida's Sebastian Inlet, leaving with victories in Open Juniors, Open Airshow and Explorer Boys. He also took the highest single-wave score in the Open Juniors division.  His other interests besides surfing include hunting and fishing. Geiselman starred in the Luke Bryan music video for the single \"Roller Coaster\". He was chosen for this role because he was into hunting and surfing, and Luke liked the fact that he was not only a successful surfer but also a country boy.  Also starring with him in the video is his current girlfriend. In December 2015, Geiselman was involved in an accident while surfing the Banzai Pipeline on O'ahu's North Shore and nearly died. He was rushed to a hospital and has since made full recovery."

After two years with Saccharine Trust, Liberty was recruited by Circle Jerks lead singer Keith Morris while at a Bangs concert, as then-bassist Roger Rogerson wanted to move from bass to guitar. The band had also recently recruited Chuck Biscuits (formerly of D.O.A. and Black Flag). The addition of Liberty gave the group a fuller sound, but a few shows into their first tour as a five-piece, Rogerson departed, and the remaining members continued on the tour without him. Liberty played his last show with the Circle Jerks at Perkins Palace in Pasadena on April 21, 1984."

  "text" : "Yevgeny Nikolayevich Kurochkin (Евгений Николаевич Курочкин; 12 July 1940 - 13 December 2011) was a Russian paleornithologist at the Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He served as President of the Menzbier Ornithological Society. He graduated from the Moscow State University in 1964. Most of his field work was done in Central Asia, Mongolia, Cuba, and Vietnam. In 1982, Kurochkin described Ambiortus, which he thought to be the oldest ornithurine (modern-type bird). Kurochkin named the new species after his peer Georgi Petrovich Dementyev (1898-1969). Opposing the theropod origin of modern birds, Kurochkin maintained that archosaurs and dinosaurs were two distinct lineages. He repeatedly questioned the assumption that Archaeopteryx and Enantiornithes were early birds. According to Kurochkin, those moderately derived theropods became extinct without leaving any descendants. He also supported the Protoavis hypothesis by Sankar Chatterjee. The Aquila kurochkini Boev 2013, an extinct eagle from Bulgaria, is named after Yevgeny Kurochkin, as is the Longusunguis kurochkini Wang, Zhou, O’Connor et Zelenkov, 2014(first described in 2014).Other bird species named after Yevgeny Kurochkin are:Anas kurochkini Zelenkov et Panteleyev, 2014, Palaelodus kurochkini Zelenkov, 2013, Zheroia kurochkini Nessov, 1988, Falco kurochkini Suárez et Olson, 2001, Glaucidium kurochkini Campbell et Bocheński, 2012, Euronyctibius kurochkini Mourer-Chauviré, 1989."

  "text" : "Erik Gunnar Nord (11 September 1918 – 19 January 2014) was a Norwegian jurist, civil servant, foreign policy researcher and politician for the Socialist Left Party. He grew up in Kolbotn, and was active in the labour movement from a young age. He took his secondary education at the Oslo Cathedral School. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany he was arrested by the Nazi authorities in June 1943. He was briefly imprisoned in Bredtveit concentration camp, then Berg concentration camp. In December 1943 he was transferred to Sennheim, then Buchenwald concentration camp where he remained until the camp was liberated. He took the cand.jur. degree in 1945 after the war's end. He was employed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1947, and served in the Norwegian United Nations delegation until 1950. He was later a secretary of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1953 to 1962, when he spent two years in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as an assistant secretary with responsibility for the fledgling development aid project. He wrote articles on foreign affairs in the left-oppositional organ Orientering, under a pseudonym. He was a member of the Labour Party, but left after the exclusion of the left opposition in Orientering in 1961. During the Cold War he was surveilled by Norwegian Police Surveillance Agency under Asbjørn Bryhn. According to some sources he was removed as committee secretary as a result of contact with the KGB, when Halvard Lange decided to move him to the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI). Nord himself has claimed to have been replaced because he was an EEC opponent. He started in NUPI in 1964 and remained here until his retirement. NUPI today counts Nord as one of their most profiled researchers, together with John Sanness, Johan Jørgen Holst, Martin Sæter, Daniel Heradstveit and Jan Egeland. He was also a prolific popular speaker, tallying up to 200 appearances a year, including events for the EU opposition, the United Nations Association of Norway and Nei til Atomvåpen (No to Nuclear Weapons). He died in January 2014."

After the death of Catherine's mother, Maria of the Palatinate-Simmern, she became the lady-in-waiting, nurse and in practice foster mother of Catherine. She were the confidant of Catherine and the two of them had a close relationship for the rest of their life, sometimes by letters, which are preserved. She married a German officer in Swedish service, but remained in the service of Catherine also after Catherine's marriage as her Mistress of the Robes. She was described as educated and seen as a role model for female nobles in this regard, could speak Latin and was given the task to practice reading and prayer with the heir to the throne, Gustav II Adolf of Sweden, and converse with foreign ambassadors."

Broman was from a lesser noble family and son of lagman Karl Broman and Eva Hök. He became a courtier of King Frederick in 1722, and soon became a personal friend and trusted confidant of the monarch, who entrusted him with the task to organize his infidelities and love affairs. In 1731, he introduced Hedvig Taube to Frederick and managed to install her as an official royal mistress. The same year, he was made kammarherre, courtier. After the death of Hedvig Taube in 1744, he introduced her successor, Catharina Ebba Horn. In return for this and similar favors, he was awarded with titles, money and offices: he became the chamberlain of the royal court in 1741 and president of commerce in 1747. Broman frequently used his favored position to accept bribes. Politically he was an ally of the Hats. Despite his great income, he became poor after the death of Frederick due to his gambling and business speculations. He married Eva Johanna Drakenhielm (1704-1747) in 1726, and in 1747, the maid of honor Vilhelmina Magdalena Taube (1720-1757), sister of the royal mistress Hedvig Taube."

Upon returning to the United States in 1985, he reported on every presidential election until his retirement from The Washington Post in 2004. He was also its bureau chief in Chicago, as well as national political editor in the early 1990s. From 2004 to 2009, he was a political reporter for The Oregonian of Portland, Oregon.

  "text" : "Eric Bercovici (February 27, 1933 – February 9, 2014) was an American television/film producer and screenwriter. He was best known for producing and adapting the screenplay for the 1980 television miniseries Shōgun. Born in New York City in 1933 to screenwriter Leonardo Bercovici, he studied theater at Yale University. His career had barely begun when his father was blacklisted from the late 1940s through the late 1950s. Eric Bercovici then went to Europe to work on films, returning to the U.S. in 1965. He then began writing episodes of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., I Spy, and The Danny Thomas Hour. He wrote the screenplays for the 1968 films Hell in the Pacific and Day of the Evil Gun. In the 1970s, he wrote episodes for Hawaii Five-O and created the series Assignment Vienna and its pilot Assignment: Munich. In 1977, he adapted John Ehrlichman's novel, The Company, into a miniseries titled Washington: Behind Closed Doors. In 1980, Bercovici adapted James Clavell's 1975 novel, Shōgun, about an English seaman marooned in 17th century Japan, into a nine-hour miniseries of the same name. He was also a producer of the series. Shōgun won three of its 14 Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Miniseries, and all three of its Golden Globe nominations, including Best TV Series – Drama. At the time, it was also one of the highest-rated miniseries in television history, second only to Roots. Bercovici would finish out the 1980s and his writing/producing career for such series as McClain's Law, Chicago Story and Noble House, also based on a Clavell novel. When not writing screenplays, Bercovici wrote crime novels."

  "text" : "Ernest G. Roy was a British film producer who was Managing Director of Kay (West End) Laboratories, Kay Carlton Hill Studios Ltd and Nettlefold Studios. He headed production for Kay's after the Second World War, overseeing films made at the company's Nettlefold Studios in Walton-on-Thames which had previously been the Hepworth Studio, often in collaboration with Butcher's Film Service (a production and distribution company). The studio had produced silent films on its two glass-house stages. When Talkies came in it was re-structured, soundproofed and an extra stage added. Notable amongst them were a series of Paul Temple films. He produced Laurence Harvey's first starring film, There Is Another Sun. His final film at Kay's was Marilyn (1953) Nettlefold Studios had been owned by the Birmingham Industrial family and in 1926 acquired film studios from Cecil Hepworth at Walton-on-Thames. The studios were requisitioned by Vickers-Armstrongs in 1940 to build Wellington Bombers. Roy produced a number of top secret films at a studio in Devon which was destroyed by bombing in 1942. Production was moved to the Maida Vale Studios in London. He was born in Clerkenwell, London, in 1892, son of Charles (1857-1932) and Lucy (1859-1942). He was brother to Eliza, Alfred, Charles, Elsie and Gladys and knew Charlie Chaplin in his youth, through his association with the ensemble Eight Lancashire Lads. Prior to World War I he was manager to J. W. Jackson who had various troupes of dancers working throughout England, America, Germany and France including the Eight Lancashire Lads in which Chaplin performed. In 1912 he worked in Paris at the Chatelet Theatre and then in the Marigny Theatre where Mistingeutt was appearing. After a year in Paris he returned to England and appeared at the old Alhambra Theatre in Leicester Square with various reviews including Eightpence a Mile and Keep Smiling. He toured all over England, Scotland and Ireland. His sister Edith Elsie Roy (1896-1925) also danced and performed with him, as did her husband whom she married in 1916, Percy Frederick Smith. He left the stage in 1914 to join up as a soldier. Following World War I he joined Kay Laboratories in 1919 as general manager and director under chairman David Martineau, with Alan and Louis Martineau on the board. The company was located in Red Lion Square, Holborn, London but soon moved to 22 Soho Square and had premises in Greek Street, London as well as processing facilities in Finsbury Park, North London. Under his leadership Kay's went from being a processor of orthochromatic film to a sophisticated processor of colour film. Its name is seen on many colour films of the post-war period. The processing facility was started in 1916 and was one of the first to install colour processing equipment under the vision of George Hawkes (technical director) with A.W. Smart and Charles Parkhouse. Ernest frequently visited 20th Century Fox in Hollywood to foster contracts with British film producers and distributors. He was awarded a Fellowship by the British Kinematograph, Sound and Television Society. His family home was Dukes Place in Wortham, Kent and he had an apartment over the studios in Greek Street, London. He produced many films around the time of World War II."

He was replaced the following season, after the team lost twice in the first conference. The Philippine Basketball Association then hired him as league chairman in 2005. He was vice president for human resources of Purefoods at the time of his death and would have served a second term as chair of the PBA board in the 2014–15 season. In February 2014, Capacio was playing a round of golf with Purefoods president Francisco Alejo. Capacio complained of back pain during the game.

  "text" : "Edward Gingerich (1966 – January 14, 2011) was an Amish man from Rockdale Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania, who was convicted of manslaughter in the 1993 death of his wife, Katie. He is the first Amish person to be convicted of homicide. He was said to have been somewhat of a rebel to the Amish way of life from an early age, and many of the others in their community were apprehensive of the marriage between Ed and Katie. He spent a lot of time in the wood shop, becoming increasingly interested in the limited machinery the Amish allowed themselves to operate as well as interacting with non-Amish people (known as the English, regardless of ethnicity). The belief was that an unwaveringly faithful woman would be a good influence on the troubled young man and so the marriage went ahead. After the wedding and the birth of a son, Gingerich became increasingly depressed. Through the wood shop he worked in, he befriended a non-Amish man called Dave Lindsey who told him that unless he renounced his Amish faith and became a born-again Christian like Lindsey, he would go to Hell. Gingerich's mental state continued to deteriorate and eventually he began hallucinating and had a psychotic break that scared his Amish community to the point of contacting 911 for help. Gingerich was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was given medication to ease his symptoms.His medication eased Gingerich's hallucinations but put him in a \"zombie\" state that he disliked and eventually he stopped taking his doses. His state of mind continued to decrease. Lindsey, among other evangelists who visited Gingerich at the wood shop, lectured him about renouncing his faith and led him to believe that he was being confined and almost held captive by his wife, Katie. There are reports that he began to associate her with the devil. On March 18th 1993, Gingerich entered his home's kitchen where Katie was working and punched her in the face, knocking her to the ground. Katie yelled for her 6-year-old son, who was in the room at the time, to run and get help. The young boy ran over a mile to his uncle's home but by the time the man arrived at the scene of the crime, Katie was long dead. Seeing his brother standing beside her gruesome body, covered in blood, the man feared for his own life and fled to the house of a nearby English family where he called 911. When EMTs arrived on the scene, one found the scene so horrific that she immediately left the house to vomit. Gingerich had beaten Katie to death; taken the time to put on heavy, high top boots; and stomped on Katie's skull until she was left unrecognizable. Not only that, Gingerich had removed all her internal organs and piled them besides her body.In recordings of Gingerich's police interrogation, he can be heard saying that \"For some reason, I think we could still save her\". After his trial, Gingerich was found \"guilty of involuntary manslaughter but mentally ill\". He was sentenced to a minimum term of two and one-half years and a maximum of five years with credit for time served since his May 19, 1993 incarceration. Hence, Ed would be eligible for parole by late 1995. Gingerich was denied his first bid for parole in Dec. 1995, however on March 19, 1998, at the age of 34, and having served his full sentence, he was released from the State Correctional Institution in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania. Gingerich was found hanged in a barn in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, where he had been living with his attorney. He wrote, \"Forgive me please\" in the dust atop a bucket before committing suicide."

  "text" : "Lady Emily Eliza Steele Gordon Cathcart (née Pringle) was born in 1845. Her father was John Robert Pringle. Her first marriage was to Captain John Gordon in 1865. The natural son of Colonel John Gordon \"the richest commoner in the northern kingdom\" he had inherited his father's extensive assets, valued at £2-3 million in 1858, on the lower estimate equivalent to £182,000,000 in 2015. The estate included Cluny Castle, North and South Uist, Benbecula and Barra. When Captain Gordon died without legitimate issue in 1878, Emily Gordon inherited the estates. Her second husband was Sir Reginald Archibald Edward Cathcart (d. 1916) whom she married in late 1880 at St George's Hanover Square, London. He was the sixth baronet of Cathcart, succeeding to the title in 1878. The Cathcart family seat was Killochan Castle near Girvan in Ayrshire but the couple lived mainly in Titness Park, Sunninghill, Berkshire. Known for her stance against Catholicism, she played a leading role in the Highland Clearances as she continued the clearances initiated by her father-in-law. Many crofters on her lands were re-settled to the North West territories of Regina and Wapella in Canada, possibly due to the shares she held in the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1891 Lady Cathcart commissioned Old Tom Morris to design a golf course at Askernish on South Uist. She included a clause in the crofters tenancy agreements retaining the right to allow golf to be played on the land. Lady Cathcart never lived in the highlands and is thought to have visited only once; she took ten Vatersay crofters to court in 1908 after they refused to vacate their cottages. They were sentenced to serve two months imprisonment but released two weeks early. She died on 8 August 1932 at Margate in Kent. Her will included instructions for a Long Island, United States emigration fund to be set up but this was never undertaken as the trustees refused to carry it out for fear of repercussions."

  "text" : "Edward Reinhard Girardet is a European-American journalist, editor, author and adventurer born in White Plains, New York on 24 March 1951, and currently based in Geneva, Switzerland. Having lived much of his youth in the United States, Bahamas, Canada and Germany, he completed his high school education at Clifton College, a British public school in Bristol, UK, and then Nottingham University, where he studied German literature. On graduating, he went to Paris to become a foreign correspondent. As a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor, US News and World Report and the PBS MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour but now other media, he has covered wars and humanitarian crisis zones in Africa, Asia, the Balkans and Central America. He is widely regarded as one of the most informed international journalists on Afghanistan and humanitarian media issues. His latest book, Killing the Cranes, is considered a classic. Girardet has written or edited various books, mainly about Afghanistan but also Africa and media. His 1985 book Afghanistan: The Soviet War was one of the first books based on personal experience about the Soviet war, the Afghan resistance and clandestine humanitarian cross-border support. He often trekked hundreds of miles across the Hindu Kush to report the Red Army war. Girardet was also the first American reporter to meet and write about Afghan resistance leader, Ahmed Shah Massoud in the summer of 1981. Girardet narrowly escaped being killed, or at least serious injury in September, 1981 when he travelled up to northern Afghanistan to see Massoud just before the latter was assassinated by two Al-Qaeda operatives. Posing as journalists, the two suicide bombers lived in the guesthouse room in Khoja Bauhouddin next to Girardet, who was on assignment for National Geographic. Girardet left several days before the assassination on 9 September 2001 because, as he wrote in Killing the Cranes, he had to get back to Europe for his wife's birthday on 13 September. Girardet edited Somalia, Rwanda and Beyond: The Role of the International Media in Wars and Humanitarian Crises published by Columbia University Press and Crosslines Global Report in 1995. Girardet has co-produced and reported various television documentaries filming, sometimes clandestinely, in places such as Western New Guinea, Haiti, Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and El Salvador. He was reporter on the BBC2 documentary \"Frontline Doctors\" about Medecins sans Frontières (MSF) during the 1990s produced by French film-makers Christophe de Ponfilly and Frederic Laffont. Girardet was also editor of Populations in Danger with MSF published by Routledge in 1996 and contributed the chapter on Liberia. Together with British editor and former Gurkha officer Jonathan Walter, Girardet co-edited and wrote The Essential Field Guide to Afghanistan in 1998 published by Crosslines Global Report and Media Action International. This is aimed at helping aid workers, diplomats, soldiers, journalists and others to be better informed about Afghanistan.The most recent 4th edition of The Essential Field Guide to Afghanistan was published in February, 2014, which includes essays and briefs by writers such as Ahmed Rashid, William Dalrymple, Christina Lamb, William Dowell, Jason Burke and Girardet himself. Girardet's latest book is Killing the Cranes - A Reporter's Journey Through Three Decades of War in Afghanistan published by Chelsea Green in 2011 and in French by Editions Les Arènes in Paris in February, 2014 as Il Parait Que Vous Voulez Me Tuer. Killing the Cranes includes a personal account of Afghanistan's nearly 35-year-long war including encounters with Islamic extremists such as Osama bin Laden and Afghan Hezb-e-Islami fundamentalist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. As with other Afghan Pushtun and Islamic radicals, Gulbuddin was supported by the Central Intelligence Agency and Pakistan's military InterServices Intelligence (ISI) during the 1980s and is now a leading insurgent figure against the post-2001 US-led intervention in Afghanistan. Girardet was founder of the International Centre for Humanitarian Reporting (ICHR) which became Media Action International. He is a specialist in 'Lifeline Media', an idea initially propagated by Media Action International, providing needs-based humanitarian information to disaster victims. Girardet is an avid proponent of quality reporting for the coverage of wars, humanitarian crises and development issues. He has organized numerous workshops for local, regional and international journalists focusing on global themes, such as climate change, humanitarian response, the environment, access to health, and water. Girardet serves as a media consultant and strategic advisor to various United Nations aid agencies and non-governmental organizations on the need for more effective public information outreach through media as a means of promoting transparency and accountability. Girardet is currently editor of Le News, a free English-language weekly for the Lake Geneva region. He is also a co-editor of the collaborative webzine, The Essential Edge - The Lake Geneva Review on Global Writing."

He studied medicine at Strasbourg, receiving his doctorate in 1824 with a thesis on lymphatic vessels. He later became an associate professor of anatomy to the Faculté de médecine at Strasbourg. He was associated with several scientific societies, including being a resident member of the Société d'histoire naturelle de Strasbourg. He is remembered for his pioneer investigations of the lymphatic system in birds and humans. In 1829 he published a handbook that provided a detailed account involving the injection and preparation of lymph vessels (in regards to anatomical viewing)."

She was not stated to be Shi Jingtang's mother, as Shi Jingtang's mother was described to be a Lady He, although it is possible that she was Shi Jingtang's birth mother and that Lady He was described to be his mother because Lady He was Shi Shaoyong's wife. After he became emperor, he honored her as consort dowager. Shortly before his death in 942, he honored her as empress dowager. After he died and was succeeded by his adoptive son (biological nephew, Shi Shaoyong's grandson) Shi Chonggui, she was honored as grand empress dowager. She died shortly after."

In 1965, he made further recordings, releasing \"The Love I Have For You\" and \"The Sad One\" on the Seven B label owned by Joe Banashak.

Following a stroke in the late 1970s, he died in 1985 at his home in Slidell, Louisiana."

Wild. He had nearly 350 film and television credits to his name, mostly Westerns, including some of the early episodes of Gunsmoke. Location work on Army Girl was done primarily at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif., where Miller cut his teeth in B-Westerns and became one of the most prolific -- and one of the best -- of the site's shooters during the course of his career. His camera work at Iverson became identifiable for Miller's trademark use of the site's charismatic sandstone rock features as framing devices, as he incorporated the giant boulders into the artistry of the outdoor action shots in ways that few cinematographers could match."

In 1925, Caton-Thompson and Gardner began the first archaeological survey of the northern Faiyum, where they sought to correlate ancient lake levels with archaeological stratification. They continued working in the Faiyum over the next two years for the Royal Anthropological Institute where they discovered two unknown Neolithic cultures. The pair also worked on prehistoric sites at Kharga Oasis in 1930. This led to research more broadly on the palaeolithic of north Africa, which Caton-Thompson published in 1952."

Williamson Ltd, and was involved with concerts and theatrical productions for more than 50 years. Born in Castlemaine, Victoria, and educated in Melbourne, he was first associated with his brother Charles in organising concert attractions, then in 1900 joined \"The Firm\" of J. C. Williamson Ltd. as treasurer at Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne. He remained with J. C. Williamson's (as general manager from 1913) until 1916, when he joined his brothers John and Nevin, who had from 1907 been bringing concert artists to Australia. In 1920, the firm of J. and N. Tait joined with the Williamson organisation; E.J., John, and Frank becoming managing directors in association with Sir George Tallis, and J. Nevin Tait a London director. He was considered one of the most colourful entrepreneurs in the history of the Australian stage. He had remarkable vitality, and was known to work 20 hours a day for days at a stretch. He would return to his office after working all day and half the night directing rehearsals then do desk work until breakfast. He could be intolerant of associates who had not the same stamina and work ethic. Two months before his death he was in New York, negotiating Australian rights to new plays. His body was cremated at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium. E.J. Tait was associated during his long career with many famous artists including John Barrymore, Dame Nellie Melba, Julius Knight (Australian leading man, died March 1941), Maud Jeffries, Robert Brough (Australian actor/comedian died April 1906), Dion Boucicault, Jr., Violet Vanbrugh, Florence Young, Nellie Stewart, Maggie Moore, Tittell Brune, Wilson Barrett, Oscar Asche, Emélie Polini and Lily Brayton."

Over the course of his career, which began in the reign of Emperor Basil II, he advanced from simple judge (litos krites) to the rank of magistros and the prestigious post of droungarios tes viglas, being perhaps the very first holder of this title as president of the Court of the Hippodrome. He was highly esteemed both during his lifetime and by later legal scholars for his knowledge and skill in decision making. Rhomaios wrote several legal treatises, chiefly comprising statements of verdict, counsel's opinions etc., but most of them have been lost. One of his colleagues, however, selected some parts of his work and, arranging them by subject in 75 titles, published a compendium known as the Peira (\"experience\"). The Peira was intended as a textbook. It contains \"in a loosely associated progression, precepts, definitions, and solutions to problems from all spheres of civil and criminal law\" (D. Simon), and its compiler tried to deduce general rules that governed Rhomaios' decisions. The Peira remained a popular book until the late Byzantine period, and was often cited by later Byzantine legal scholars."

  "text" : "Elaine Trebek Kares, formerly known as Elaine Callei, is an American businesswoman. Originally from Columbus, Ohio, and a journalism graduate of Ohio State University, she was a Playboy Bunny in the 1960s under the pseudonym Teddy Howard. With her first husband Louis Callei, she later moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where she ran her own promotion and party planning business before joining CHCH-TV in Hamilton as host of a daily talk show, Call Callei. The show was noted particularly for Callei's boundary-pushing interest in sexual topics; her 1972 interview with Xaviera Hollander led to a reprimand from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in early 1973. She left CHCH to take over as cohost of CTV's Canada AM in February 1973, after Carole Taylor left the program to join W5; however, she lasted only a few months before leaving the program by mutual agreement that she wasn't a good fit for a morning show, and was succeeded by Helen Hutchinson. She married Alex Trebek in 1974, returning to the United States as he pursued career opportunities there. They divorced in 1981. She had no children with Trebek, although he became adoptive father to her daughter Nicky from her previous marriage. She later remarried to film producer Peter Kares, and launched her own businesses, including Scent Seal, which created a new system for packaging perfume and fragrance samples, and Mag-a-Music, an early foray into multimedia music distribution. She currently owns and operates Gallery GO, an art gallery in Los Angeles, California."

  "text" : "Ellis Meredith (1865–1955) was an American suffragist, journalist, and novelist, known as the Susan B. Anthony of Colorado. Her mother Emily R. Meredith was a suffragist as well. Ellis Meredith was born in Montana in 1865, and later moved to Denver, where she joined the Rocky Mountain News in 1893. She began writing the column A Woman's World for the Rocky Mountain News in 1889, where she (among other things) advocated women's suffrage. In 1890 she and five other women founded the Colorado Non-Partisan Equal Suffrage Association. In 1893 she went to the Woman’s Congress at the Chicago World’s Fair in August 1893 to ask for help from Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone, leading suffrage activists, saying, \"If Colorado goes for woman suffrage, you may count on a landslide in that direction throughout the west.\" Susan B. Anthony agreed to send organizer Carrie Chapman Catt to help, and Meredith wrote to Anthony about the situation in Colorado while Carrie Chapman Catt traveled around Colorado organizing. On November 7, 1893, the men of Colorado voted for women's suffrage. Meredith stayed involved in politics after that, however. In 1894 she became part of the editorial staff of the Rocky Mountain News, where was the first female journalist in Colorado, and probably the United States, to cover the legislature. In 1902, she helped write Denver's first city charter as one of only was four female delegates to the Denver City Charter convention. She was the vice chair of the Democratic Party State Central Committee from 1904 until 1908, and in February 1904 she became one of the people from Colorado to testify to the House of Representatives' Committee on the Judiciary in favor of the suffrage amendment. She was also elected City Election Commissioner in 1910, and served as such until 1915. In 1917 she moved to Washington, D.C. to work at the National Democratic headquarters. Meredith also wrote three novels - The master-knot of human fate (1901), Heart of my heart (1904), and Under the Harrow (1907). The Ellis Meredith Papers are held in the Colorado Historical Society in Denver, Colorado."

A Russian German, he became an officer of the Imperial Russian Army. During the Russian Civil War he sided with the White movement and fought against the Bolsheviks, notably as the last chief of staff of Kornilov Division of the Army of General Wrangel. After the war he fled to Yugoslavia as one of notable White émigrées. He settled in Belgrade where he remained an active member of the Russian All-Military Union and a professor at the Higher Military Courses of Belgrade. During World War II as an ardent anti-communist he sided with the Axis powers and the Russian Liberation Movement, and briefly served in the propaganda services of the Wehrmacht as head of the Russian section. In early 1945 he returned to active front-line service as a Major in Boris Smyslovsky's 1st Russian National Army. Through Liechtenstein Messner and his family moved in 1947 to Argentina, where he continued his earlier work as a journalist, publisher, writer and military theorist. His most well-known publication, \"Mutiny, or the name of the Third World War\" (Russian: Мятеж — имя третьей всемирной), predicted that the future wars would be waged by small terrorist cells and special forces, gaining influence by subversion and organised revolutions rather than through traditional warfare. Messner died in Buenos Aires in 1974 and was buried at the British Cemetery there."

She had been a student of Cecilia Fryxell. Elsa Borg was the daughter of the vicar Denis Borg (d. 1837) and Hedvig Elisabet Borg (d. 1830): her mother was the cousin of Pär Aron Borg. She was educated in a girls' school in first Sala and then Stockholm, and finally at the school of Cecilia Fryxell. After having completed her education, she worked as a governess. Between 1859 and 1874, Elsa Borg functioned as the principal of the Christian Girls' School in Gävle, regarded as the local pioneer educational institution for females in that city. Elsa Borg was one of the foremost representatives of the Great Awakening in Sweden. After a visit to Great Britain in 1876 and 1878, she came to know William Boardman and Granville Waldegrave, 3rd Baron Radstock, and having returned to Sweden, she devoted herself to mission work combined with Christian social work. In 1875, Elsa Borg moved to Stockholm, where she founded a Bible Home for women with the support of Queen Sophia. The institution was situated in the Stockholm ill reputed slum of Vita Bergen (White Mountains). The home was meant to educate female Christian social workers. In 1877, it expanded to include an asylum for former female prostitutes, in 1881 an orphanage and in 1883 a hospital, and in 1885 a home for the education of missionaries: this was followed by branches in other parts of the country. From 1885, she also published a missionary paper, Trons hvila."

His design directly influenced Sunbeam Racing cars as early as 1914; the 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeams owe much to his work with Ballot and the 1922 Grand Prix Sunbeams were designed by him. His engine operational architecture was the precursor of modern engines. One biographer called him \"perhaps the most brilliant engine designer ever\"; another described one of his designs as \"so technically advanced it could have landed from outer space\". Henry's \"theory, design and execution\" of twin-cam engines was to guide engine development in Europe and then around the world for the next century."

  "text" : "Ernestine Maude Bowes-Lyon, known as \"Tenie\" to her friends was born at Glamis Castle in Scotland in 1891 and died in 1981 in Navarrenx, south of France. Tenie was one of five children. Her father Ernest Bowes-Lyon (son of Claude Bowes-Lyon) died ten days after her birth, 2 days after Christmas, in a riding accident in 1891. He was a diplomat; a Consul in Belgrade. Tenie's mother was a Drummond, of the family of Drummonds bank, of 49 Charing Cross, the bank of the Royal Family. Tenie grew up in Glamis Castle along with her younger cousin Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon the future Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and learnt to drive a coach and four down Glamis drive. During her early years she had the privilege of meeting and learning from poets, writers, philosophers and other intelligencia of the period. One in particular, writer P. G. Wodehouse, remained a friend and correspondent until his death and one of his last letters written was to Tenie. Wodehouse dedicated his book The Pothunters to Ernestine Bowes-Lyon. Tenie first married in 1910, and had two children. She met Ronald Grant de Longueuil, 10th Baron de Longueuil, at the Christmas Ball of the Tate family, (Tate Gallery) in December 1913. Having eloped with Ronnie and the ensuing scandal, she followed Ronnie to the Western Front where she took the role of a nursing assistant dealing with the horrors of the dreadful injuries of the war. At the declaration of the Armistice she met up with Ronnie. He, war-weary and uncertain of his future, asked her to return to her family. Shocked at this and the certain humiliation, she took out of her shoulder bag the small revolver she kept for protection, and shot herself in the chest. Miraculously she survived (with the bullet lodged by her heart) and in hospital informed Ronnie that she was pregnant. Having had two children previously she knew the sign and symptoms. Ronald and Ernestine moved to The chateau of Sus, near Navarrenx in the south west of France, essentially they were squatters. Raoul Charles was born in 1919, and Raymond de Longueuil followed soon after in 1921. Raoul who went on to be a naval aviator and was killed over the North Sea in 1942 in pursuit of the Nazi Tirpitz Battleship, hence Raymond the second born inherited the title Baron de Longueuil. Tenie enjoyed outdoor life as well as high society. She knew her flowers and the stars. She sketched and painted in watercolour and in 1970 had her own exhibition in France and was greeted in a number of local papers.One thing that recurs daily is her routine of afternoon tea, prompt at 3.45, or 4pm; invariably with tea that was a mixture of Ceylon and Earl Grey. This was a time of discussion, topics of interest. She remained an aristocrat in her behaviour and was very much The Lady. She held opinions, and could be very critical. She told stories to her grandson Michael Grant about Glamis castle being haunted and her experiences there. Tenie lead quite a social life between Navarrenx and Pau. She and her husband Ronnie travelled widely in Europe, especially Switzerland. She drove up until she was 85; usually a big Citroen DS classic. She had her hip replaced in 1976 and was swimming in the river six months later. In fact, Tenie had been swimming in the local river up to six months before she died. The bullet lodged in her heart remained there for over 60 years until her death at age 89/90. Tenie's great granddaughter is the actress and adventurer Rachel Grant de Longueuil, best known for her role as Bond girl Peaceful in the James Bond film Die Another Day."

  "text" : "Egon Kornauth (14 May 1891 – 28 October 1959) was an Austrian composer and music teacher. Kornauth was born in Olmütz, Moravia. A cellist and pianist from his youth, he went in 1909 to Vienna, where he studied with Robert Fuchs, Guido Adler, Franz Schreker (with whom he quarrelled) and Franz Schmidt. After teaching music theory at Vienna University from 1919, Kornauth embarked on an international career as pianist, accompanist and conductor that took him to Indonesia (1926-9) and to South America (1934-5). In 1940 he resumed a teaching career in war-time Vienna and Salzburg. He joined the Nazi-sponsored Reichsmusikkammer, but continued to support his teacher Adler, who was held under house arrest as a Jew, until the latter's death in 1941. In post-war Austria, Kornauth became director of the Salzburg Mozarteum (1946-7), and was elected to the Austrian Arts Senate in 1954. He died in Vienna in 1959. Kornauth composed extensively and won a number of prizes including the Austrian State Prize (1913) (for his Viola Sonata op.3), the Gustav Mahler Foundation prize (1919), and the Austrian Würdigungspreis (1951). His style was however conventional; when the English composer Humphrey Searle visited Vienna in the 1930s he was displeased to find that the only modern music played by the main orchestras was that of Schmidt \"or lesser composers like ... Kornauth.\" Kornauth himself recognised in his 1958 autobiography that \"epigonism was inherent in my personality.\" Most of Kornauth's output consists of lieder, chamber music and piano pieces, but there are also five orchestral suites amongst other larger scale pieces. A recording of some of Kornauth's piano works by Jonathan Powell was released by Toccata Classics in 2013."

A successful all-rounder, Dowson scored over a thousand runs and 99 wickets in the 1901 season; a thousand runs and 76 wickets the following year, and another thousand runs and 42 wickets in 1903. He also took 80 wickets during a single tour of the West Indies in the winter of 1901-02. His first class career ended in 1903 with the final match of the 1903 County Championship, however Dowson was invited back by the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1913 to play his final first class game when the MCC played Cambridge University at Lord's cricket ground.

  "text" : "Emerson Bennett (March 16, 1822 – May 11, 1905) was a popular American author primarily known for his lively romantic adventure tales depicting American frontier life. He was the author of over 30 novels and hundreds of short stories. At one time, Bennett was one of the most popular authors in America. Several of his books reportedly sold over 100,000 copies. Bennett's work frequently appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, The New York Ledger and other periodicals. Some of his writings were translated into other languages. Bennett also wrote poetry and edited several periodicals. However these other literary endeavors never met with the commercial success of his prose fiction. Bennett wrote light, sensational and heroic adventure tales which many readers found engaging. His work sometimes first appeared in serialized form in newspapers and periodicals, which were subsequently reissued in book form. Despite selling well at times, Bennett's fiction is generally regarded as substantially lacking in literary merit. He is more remembered as one of the leading novelists of the “yaller kivers” period of mid-nineteenth century American fiction, (so called for the “yellow covers” on the cheap sensational novels sold in railway stations and by newsboys during that era.) His books have also been called \"dime novels\". Bennett's popularity declined significantly during his later life. Bennett was born in Monson, Massachusetts in May 16, 1822 and attended local schools and Monson Academy. At 17, he left home with the intention of becoming a writer. Little is known about this period of Bennett's life. It is known that after leaving home he moved initially to New York City, and then later to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Pittsburgh, eventually relocating to Cincinnati in 1844. During this period he lived frugally and supported himself in several sales jobs. Unable to gain steady employment as a writer, he took work going on the road throughout Ohio selling subscriptions for the Western Literary Journal. Returning from one of these sales trips, Bennett learned that a story he had written while in Philadelphia had been published. On the strength of this first successful story, Bennett was able to obtain a commission to write a serialized story for the Western Literary Journal. Many more publications of Bennett's work followed. Bennett also edited several periodical publications during his career. In 1847 Bennett married Eliza G. Daly. In 1850, he returned to Philadelphia, where he eventually retired. He spent the last few years of his life as a resident of the Masonic Home in that city, until his death in 1905 at the age of 82. Although not altogether without artistic merit, Bennett's fiction has been characterized as derivative and formulaic, lacking originality. His work was also at times overtly racist or antisemitic. Today Bennett is remembered primarily as a figure of historical interest for the depictions he rendered of life on the American frontier. Bennett at times incorporated actual historical persons and events into his fictionalized stories. Bennett himself is considered a noteworthy figure in the early history of American popular fiction."
