Chaves was influenced by the Bolivian novelist Alcides Arguedas, who in 1919 wrote the indigenist novel Raza de bronze (Race of Bronze). Chávez' novel influenced other future indigenist novelists of Ecuador, such as Jorge Icaza whose novel Huasipungo (1934) is the most important indeginist novel from Ecuador. Chaves was born in Otavalo. He was married to Magdalena Marie Ribreau, who died of a stroke in 1982. In 1991 he received the National Grand Cross of the Order of Merit. Chaves died in 1999."

Elected to Croydon Local Board, he was one of the main proponents of the incorporation of Croydon as a borough, and was one of the first members of the town council, elected an alderman, following the granting of a charter in 1883. He was subsequently a justice of the peace for the borough.  He was also a member of Croydon School Board. He was also a temperance activist as a leading member of the Band of Hope. At the 1892 general election he was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Lambeth North, with a majority over his Liberal Unionist opponent, Henry Morton Stanley, of 130 votes. Coldwells was a director of the Liberator Building Society, established by Jabez Balfour, the first Mayor of Croydon. After the collapse of the company Coldwells was pursued through the courts for large sums of money by some of the society's shareholders. He described himself as being \"slowly killed with worry\", and did not defend his parliamentary seat at the next election in 1895. Shortly before his death it became clear he faced a criminal trial at the High Court. He was found dead in a summer house in Bournemouth shortly after leaving parliament. At the inquest into his death it was found that he died from heart failure, possibly aggravated by stress."

  "text" : "Frank John Gravino (January 29, 1923 - April 5, 1994) was a longtime minor league baseball outfielder who played from 1940 to 1942 and from 1946 to 1954. Known as the \"greatest slugger in Northern League history,\" he hit .292 with 271 home runs and a .583 slugging percentage in his 12-year career. Gravino signed with the St. Louis Cardinals and began his career as a 17-year-old pitcher in 1940. Playing for the Class-D Williamson Red Birds that year, he was 10-5 with a Mountain State League-leading 133 walks (in 130 innings pitched) and a 4.57 ERA in 25 games on the mount. He hit .227 with two home runs in 39 games at the plate. The following year, with Williamson and the Class-D Batesville Pilots, he hit .218 with two home runs in 62 games. He only pitched for Batesville that season and had a 3-5 record with a 6.75 ERA in 14 games. He hit .198 with no home runs in 52 games for the Class-D Albany Cardinals in 1942, but was 13-9 with a 3.52 ERA in 28 pitching appearances. He did not play professionally from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. He returned to the Cardinals system in 1946 and hit .339 with 30 doubles, 15 triples, 21 home runs and a .628 slugging percentage for the Class-D Hamilton Cardinals and Class-B Allentown Cardinals. The next season, in 115 games split between the Class-C Winston-Salem Cardinals (104 games) and Class-A Omaha Royals (11 games), Gravino hit .299 with 16 home runs. He hit .277 with 18 home runs and 74 RBI for the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings in 1948 and in 1949, in a year split between the Class-A Columbus Cardinals and Omaha, he hit .273 with seven home runs in 70 games. He left the Cardinals system following the 1949 season and played in the Panamanian Professional Baseball League that winter. He then played in unaffiliated baseball in 1950 and 1951. In 1950, he hit .252 with 18 home runs in 80 games split between the Class-C St. Jean Braves and Class-B St. Petersburg Saints, finishing second, behind Silvio Garcia, in the Provincial League in home runs. He had his first of four straight 35-plus home run seasons in 1951, hitting .289 with 42 home runs in 121 games for St. Jean. He led the Provincial League in home runs and was second in total bases (284) and slugging percentage (.627), behind Joseph Monteiro and Johnny Davis, respectively. Gravino spent most of 1952 with the unaffiliated Class-C Fargo-Moorhead Twins, but began year with the Class-B Cedar Rapids Indians in the Cleveland Indians system. Overall, he hit .280 with 37 home runs in 121 games. He led the Northern League in home runs, RBI (108) and slugging percentage (.643) and made the Northern League All-Star team that season. With Fargo-Moorhead - now an Indians affiliate - again in 1953, Gravino hit .352 with 52 home runs, 174 RBI, 12 triples, 369 total bases and a .783 slugging percentage in 125 games. He led the Northern League in home runs (the second place finisher had 18), RBI, slugging percentage and total bases. He set league records in home runs and RBI. He placed behind Horace Greenwood in hits with 166, finished behind Santo Luberto in batting average, tied for second in games played and tied for third in triples. His hot hitting helped propel the Twins to a league pennant that season and earned him league MVP honors. Also of note, he played alongside Roger Maris in the outfield that season. He returned to the Twins in 1954 and hit .301 with a record-breaking 56 home runs, 354 total bases and a .707 slugging percentage in 135 games, again leading the Twins to a pennant. Once again, he led the Northern League in hits, slugging percentage and total bases while outnumbering the home run outputs of four entire Northern League teams that season. Despite putting up league-leading numbers in 1954, deteriorating eyesight forced him to end his career prematurely. Overall, Gravino hit .292 with 1,144 hits, 199 doubles, 64 triples, 271 home runs and a .583 slugging percentage in 1,148 games. He hit over 20 home runs five times and exceeded the .300 batting mark thrice. He was born in Newark, New York and died in Rochester, New York."

  "text" : "Fazal Malik Akif (Urdu: فضل مالك عاکف‎) (born 22 October 1947) is a Pashto singer and songwriter, who gained popularity in the 1970s for introducing a modern and eclectic twist to traditional Pashto folk compositions. He is widely regarded as the first \"pathan pop star\" for collaborating indigenous instruments such as the rubab, harmonium and tabla with contemporary synthesizers, accordion, drums and electric guitar. He typically sang in his native language of Pashto, but his repertoire extends to Urdu, Punjabi, Hindko, Sindhi, Balochi, Saraiki and Farsi. Unlike other Pashtun performers of his time, Akif adopted an exuberant and expressive style on stage, which led to him being labelled as a \"game changer\" of the Pashto music scene. Due to the romantic nature of his lyrics he was considered a heartthrob and built a large female following. His energetic engagement with audiences broke Pashtun music traditions and often caused mayhem and mass hysteria. Recognised for his exceptionally deep voice, Akif has been credited for altering the face of conventional Pashto folk music. His musical influences include K.L. Saigal, Pankaj Mullick, Jagmohan, C.H. Atma and Mukesh. Akif overcame resistance by traditionalists of his era and is amongst the most distinct artists to have risen from the Pashto music industry."

Faraz's latest work includes OTHER-ISTAN - The other face of Pakistan completed in 2016. The era of silent films was already over by the time of the independence of Pakistan in 1947. The new country inherited a film industry from the days of the British Raj (based mainly in the city of Lahore) that had already been producing 'talkies' or sound films since the 1930s. The Pakistani film industry (also known today as Lollywood) therefore did not produce any silent films till the year 2013 when Waqar completed his film Meeoww Billi aur World War 3. The film is an artistic experiment inspired by the era of silent cinema and carries a political message. It is regarded as the first ever silent film in the history of cinema in Pakistan."

  "text" : "FRANZ SCHAFRANEK, OBE Founder of Vienna's English Theatre1930-1991The theatre was, in retrospect, Franz Schafranek’s destiny from the cradle on. The founder and director of Vienna’s English Theatre certainly grew into a total theatre person: a visionary and realist; philosopher and entrepreneur; an artist through and through. His youthful ambition to study literature and theatre arts led him out of the gloomy confines of post-war Austria to Sweden. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of Stockholm where he attracted the attention of Ingmar Bergman. After serving under the famed Swedish filmmaker as assistant director, Schafranek went on to Berlin. Here he gained invaluable insights and experience working with Bertolt Brecht at his \"Theater on the Schiffbauerdamm.\" In 1963, having returned to Vienna after his years abroad, he embarked on a venture deemed incredible at the time. No one believed he could make a success of the English-speaking theatre he founded together with his American wife, Ruth Brinkmann. Yet, without public subsidies, relying only on his own vision and sure theatrical instincts, he achieved the seemingly impossible. In a city still mired in post-war provincialism, Franz Schafranek found a ready-made audience eager from the start to lend support and fill the seats of Vienna’s English Theatre. Within a few years Franz Schafranek’s confident vision, personal charisma and tireless leadership had made Vienna’s English Theatre into a permanent fixture in the city’s theatrical landscape. Ever searching out new possibilities, he gained wide recognition for his theatre and for the city of Vienna as a forward-looking centre of international theatre. He staged world premieres of works by renowned American playwrights, Tennessee Williams, William Saroyan and Edward Albee, as well as numerous continental premieres of British and American dramas. He also brought prominent stars of stage and screen to perform on his Josefsgasse stage. Others might have been satisfied with such achievements, but Franz Schafranek was never one to rest on his laurels. In 1978 he founded the \"Theatre Français de Vienne\", and in 1985 the \"Teatro Italiano di Vienna\", exciting new interest with productions and star appearances from these countries.Franz Schafranek placed the world on the small stage of Vienna’s English Theatre. He took his success with characteristic modesty and a sure sense of the possibilities open to him. These he carried to the utmost, earning numerous awards both at home and abroad in recognition of his contribution to the dramatic arts. His greatest reward was doubtless the steady increase and loyal patronage of his many subscribers. The theatre was his life, and his sudden death in the night following a much acclaimed premiere, while shocking, seemed appropriate in the Rilkian sense of, \"Oh God! Give to each his own death.\" Franz Schafranek had actually envisioned taking his final bow at such a moment of deep personal fulfilment and fate granted this wish. He has left the stage, yet his life work lives on in Vienna’s English Theatre."

  "text" : "Frederick Lucian Hosmer (1840–1929) was an American Unitarian minister who served congregations in Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, Missouri, and California and who wrote many significant hymns. Beginning in 1875 and continuing for nearly four decades, he and William Channing Gannett worked together, making a contribution to hymnody comparable to that of the \"two Sams,\" Longfellow and Johnson, a generation earlier. The Unitarian Universalist hymnbook, Singing the Living Tradition contains eight of his hymns, including #45 \"Now While the day in Trailing Splendor\", #53 \"I walk the unfrequented Road\", #96 \"I Cannot Think of them as Dead\", #105 \"From Age to Age\", \"#114 \"Forward Through the Ages\", #269 \"Lo the Day of Days is Here\", \"#270 \"O Day of Light and Gladness\", and #272 \"O Prophet Souls of All the Years\". His notable hymn, \"Forward Through the Ages\", was an anthem of the Social Gospel movement. Written while he served the church in California, it replaced the militaristic imagery of Onward Christian Soldiers with a broader evocation of spiritual mission and unity. It is included in the United Methodist Hymnal as #555. Frederick Hosmer, was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, on October 16, 1840, the son of Charles and Susan Hosmer. He graduated from Harvard College in 1862 and from the Harvard Divinity School in 1869. He became a friend of William Gannett when both were students at the Divinity School. In his earlier years he was known as a beloved pastor and an acceptable preacher, his most successful pastorate being that in Cleveland, where he built up a strong and influential church. On October 26, 1869, he was ordained minister of the First Congregational Church (Unitarian) of Northborough, Massachusetts, where he remained for three years. From October 1872 until April 1877, he served as the Minister at the Quincy Unitarian Church in Quincy, IL. He was active not only as an organizer and director of the activities of young people but as a power in liberalizing the thought of the Quincy, IL community. Thereafter he was minister of the First Unitarian Church of Cleveland, Ohio, 1878–1892. He went on to be the minister of The Church of the Unity in Saint Louis, Missouri from September 1894 to September 1899; and of the First Unitarian Church of Berkeley, California, 1900–15, where he was named minister emeritus until his death on June 7, 1929. It was not until he approached middle life that he began to write hymns. In 1880 Hosmer, Gannett and James Vila Blake compiled and edited Unity Hymns and Chorals for the Congregation and the Home, a hymnbook which had a considerable circulation in its day and of which a revised edition was brought out in 1911. In 1886 Hosmer and Gannett published The Thought of God in Hymns and Poems, a book which contained fifty–six pieces by Hosmer. The English hymnologist Percy Dearmer described Hosmer’s hymn, “O Thou in all thy might so far,” as “this flawless poem, one of the completest expressions of religious faith.” About Hosmer’s hymn “Thy kingdom come—on bended knee/ The passing ages pray,” (written for the 1891 Commencement of the Meadville Theological School), Dearmer wrote, “one of the noblest hymns in the language.” Hosmer often wrote hymns for special occasions, the most notable instance being his great hymn “O prophet souls of all the years,” written for the Parliament of Religions held in Chicago in 1893, to capture the vision and spirit of that watershed meeting. It has been said of Frederick Hosmer that he \"...was a man of highest ethical standards and keen religious insight. He was never married, but he was a beloved friend and a delightful companion who could entertain with witty impromptu verse as well as illuminate conversation with profound thought. Esteemed as he was as a parish minister, his hymns were the great and lasting contribution which he made to the religious life of his time.\""

Stewart also served as acting director of Memorial in 1944 while Rhoads was in the military. In 1947, while Rhoads was director of Memorial, Stewart received a grant of $30,000 for cancer pathology and other teaching. This was part of the largest aggregation of Federal cancer grants ever given to a single institution at that time, a total of $142,550. In the 1940s, while at Memorial Hospital (which later merged with Sloan-Kettering), Stewart studied breast cancer with Frank W. Foote, Jr. Stewart-Treves syndrome, one of the classical sarcoma syndromes, was first described by Stewart and Norman Treves in 1948, in the first issue of the Cancer journal. Stewart was the editor of Cancer until 1961, when he was replaced by John W. Berg."

He reconstructed all the main roads, rebuilt the council offices and Hampton Pier and constructed a new sea wall. He sewered the East Cliff and nine miles of private roads at the east end of Herne Bay. His crowning achievement was his design of both phases (1904 and 1913) of the King's Hall, Herne Bay. His extensive works helped to provide employment and to make the town what it is today. Archaeological artefacts turned up by his constant digging contributed to the collection now in Herne Bay Museum."

  "text" : "Franz Johann Heinrich Nadorp, (June 23, 1794 – September 17, 1876) was a German painter who primarily worked and lived in Rome. Nadorp was born in Isselburg into a family of artists. He was the only son of Johann Theodor Nadorp and Gertrud Anna Stroof. After his education at the Anholt City school, he was joined at age 20 by a fellowship of his country gentlemen Prince Constantin of Salm-Salm in the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, where he trained as a historical painter with his teacher Joseph Bergler. Nadorp was the favorite pupil of Bergler. In 1822 he received the gold medal of the Academy. When in 1826 his mentor died, Nadorp broke his tents from Prague and returned in 1827 for a few months in his hometown district of Anholt in Isselburg. In the fall of 1827 Nadorp traveled with his companions Prince Franz of Salm-Salm to Rome. The city of Rome drew at the time many German artists, such as Peter Cornelius, Johann Friedrich Overbeck and Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld. Nadorp was quite fast in the group of German artists, called the \"Nazarenes\". He was one of the founders of the Roman Künstlerbund (1829) and the German Artists' Union (1845). The years 1840-1850 are among his most fertile. Numerous drawings surviving. During this time, Nadorp met the King Ludwig I of Bavaria, and they both shared a friendship. 1859 Nadorp was received by King Frederick William IV of Prussia, and led to his first government contract. Nadorp left Rome only rarely in the nearly 50 years of local work. In 1862 he returned for a short time back in his hometown. For his baptismal church of St. Pancras, he created an altarpiece The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple and drew the located shortly before the demolition of the old town church. In 1876 Prince Alfred I of Salm-Salm granted him an annuity. Nadorp, which is considered a romantic German painter in style, died shortly thereafter in Rome and buried at Campo Santo Teutonico next to St. Peter in the Vatican. His entire estate was transferred to the Princes of Salm -Salm and can still be seen today in the Museum Wasserburg Anholt and in the parish church of St. Pancras."

Parsons was a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists, and served as director in 1775 and the following years, and as their treasurer in 1776. A portrait of James Brindley the engineer, by Parsons, was engraved in mezzotint by R. Dunkarton in 1770, and published by Parsons at his house in Great Ormond Street, London. The same portrait was also engraved by Cook. Another portrait of Cunne Shote, a Cherokee chief, by Parsons, was engraved in mezzotint by J. McArdell. As he did not succeed greatly in portraiture, Parsons latterly kept a shop as a dealer in and restorer of pictures. He exhibited for the last time in 1783."

He wrote the first song that Talat Mahmood sang in 1941 (Sab din ek samaan nahin tha) and the runaway hit Tasveer teri dil mera behla na sakay gi. Soon after the Partition of India in 1947 he was transferred to Lahore to organise the music scene in Pakistan. There he promoted many talented artists including Farida Khanum, Saeen Marna, Saeen Akhtar and Saeen Budha. He turned to writing of film songs in 1956. Kunwari Bewa was the first Pakistani film with his songs. He wrote more than 2000 songs for films and the Gramophone Recording Company. He also wrote stories, dialogues and scripts of many hit films, and received numerous awards during his career."

  "text" : "Francis Peter Labilliere (13 August 1840 – 19 February 1895) was an Anglo-Australian historian. Labilliere was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, the son of Huguenot-descended Charles Edgar de Labilliere and his wife Hannah, née Balle (died 1880). Charles and Hannah de Labilliere travelled in the Westminster, the second ship which sailed from England direct for the Port Phillip District, and landed in Melbourne in December 1839. Charles de Labilliere engaged in pastoral pursuits at Tallook Yale, near Bacchus Marsh, and later died in London on 2 November 1870. Francis Labilliere, went to England with his father in 1859; entered at the Middle Temple on 7 November 1860; called to the bar on 6 June 1863; married at St. Saviour's, Paddington, on 9 October 1867, Adelaide, eldest daughter of the late Rev. Edward Ravenshaw, rector of West Rington, Wiltshire. Labilliere always took a deep interest in the relations of the mother country and the colonies, and was one of the very earliest advocates of Imperial Federation, developing his views on the question in a succession of papers, the first at the Social Science Congress at Bristol, in 1869, on \"The Future Relations of England and her Colonies\"; the second at the Colonial Conference, Westminster Palace Hotel, in 1871, of which he was honorary secretary, on \"Imperial and Colonial Federalism\"; the two next before the Royal Colonial Institute, in 1875 on \"The Permanent Unity of the Empire\"; and in 1881 on \"The Political Organisation of the Empire\". Labilliere again opened the question before the Social Science Congress at Birmingham, in 1884, and before the conference arranged by the Royal Colonial Institute at the Colonial Exhibition of 1886. He also combated the views of Goldwin Smith and other advocates of disintegration, in an article on \"The Contraction of England, and its Advocates,\" in the National Review, in 1884. In that year also, on his suggestion, the first steps were taken to found the Imperial Federation League, he being honorary secretary to the provisional committee, and afterwards, jointly with Mr. Arnold Forster, to the League, on its establishment. From 1874 to 1881, as a member of the council of the Royal Colonial Institute, he assisted Sir Frederick Young in the honorary secretarial work of the society before it was in a position to maintain a paid staff. As appears by the correspondence laid before Parliament in 1876, he was the first to suggest the annexation of Eastern New Guinea, in a long letter addressed in 1874 to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a copy of which was sent, with a covering despatch, by Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon to each of the governors of the Australian colonies. In 1878 Labilliere's \"Early History of the Colony of Victoria\" appeared, in two volumes. It corrected the previously received date of the discovery of Port Phillip Bay, and brought to light many facts and documents which had been forgotten, or never before made public. de Labilliere resided at Harrow in his latter years and died there on 19 February 1895."

  "text" : "Franz Petrak (9 October 1886, Mährisch-Weißkirchen – 9 October 1973, Vienna) was an Austrian-Czech mycologist. From 1906 to 1910, he studied botany at the University of Vienna, where he was a student of Richard Wettstein. In 1913 he obtained his doctorate of sciences, and until 1916, worked as a high school teacher in Vienna. During World War I, he was stationed in Galicia and Albania, where he collected specimens in his spare time. From 1918 to 1938, he worked as a private scientist in his home town, and from 1938 to 1951, was associated with the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna. He was the author of nearly 500 published works, primarily in the field of mycology. Much of his mycological work was published in the journal Annales mycologici and its successor Sydowia. Reportedly, his private herbarium contained 100,000 specimens. As a taxonomist, he described numerous species within the genus Cirsium (family Asteraceae). The mycological genera Petrakiella, Petrakiopeltis and Petrakina are named in his honor, the latter genus being circumscribed by Raffaele Ciferri in 1932. Franz Petrak died 9 October 1973 in Vienna."

He is best known as author of the Flora Wirceburgensis (\"Flora of the Grand Duchy of Würzburg\"), published in two parts (1810, 1811), with a supplement issued in 1815. After his death, his herbarium was passed on to botanist August Schenk (1815-1891).

In 1971, he was elected to the State Assembly from Essex County District 11B. The top vote getter in that race was Anthony Imperiale, also a Newark City Councilman, who ran as an Independent. Imperiale received 13,857 votes, with Megaro winning the second seat with 12,436 votes. Defeated were Megaro's running mate, Democratic Assemblyman Paul Policastro with 10,825 votes, followed by Republican Assemblyman C. Richard Fiore with 8,215 votes, Republican Ralph D'Ambola (7,351 votes), Independent Ronald J. Del Mauro (3,323 votes), and Independent Nicholas A. Ciufi II (2,729 votes). He ran for re-election to a second term in 1973, but lost the Democratic primary. The newly-drawn 30th legislative district included Newark's North Ward and Belleville in Essex County and Kearny and Harrison in Hudson County. Michael Adubato, the brother of North Ward political leader Steve Adubato, Sr., and John Cali of Kearny, won with 9,289 and 8,435 votes, respectively. Megaro lost by 412 votes, receiving a total of 8,023. Fiorentino Alati finished 4th with 7,404. Megaro became Newark City Council President in 1973 following the resignation of Louis Turco. In 1974, he lost his North Ward Council seat to Anthony Carrino, a Newark police officer. In 1983, Megaro ran again for State Assembly as an Independent in the 28th district, winning just 3,098 against incumbents Adubato and James Zangari. In 1995, Megaro pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges connected to a Newark towing contract."

His parents settled in Haywards Heath in 1880, and before the end of the century Miller had set up \"The Mid-Sussex Photographic Studio\" in Haywards Heath, offering photographs \"in any size and newest styling\" and services including \"copying and enlarging\". He also photographed outdoor events such as \"garden parties\". In 1903 he started to publish and sell picture postcards, and the business grew and became successful. He married Kate Elizabeth Peerless in 1905. Miller ran the studio until he sold the business to Ebenezer William Pannell in February 1916, and moved to Worthing with his wife, where they lived for the rest of their lives. His wife died on 19 March 1959, and Miller died in Southlands Hospital in Shoreham-by-Sea on 7 June 1961."

  "text" : "Joseph Colin Francis Johnson (12 February 1848 – 18 June 1904), generally called J. C. F. Johnson or Frank Johnson, was a journalist and politician in colonial South Australia, Minister of Education 1887 to 1889. Johnson was born in Adelaide, the son of Henry Johnson, an Adelaide solicitor, by his marriage with Wilhelmina Colquhoun, née Campbell, the third daughter of Colin Campbell, of Stonefield, Pine Forest, South Australia. His father moved to Victoria (Australia) during the gold-digging fever, Joseph was educated at the Geelong National Grammar School. Returning to South Australia in 1868, he was for eleven years on the staff of the South Australian Register, noted for his theatre criticisms as The Gallery Boy. In December 1878 he purchased a half-share in the Adelaide Punch and shortly afterwards became sole proprietor. He conducted it for several years, but the paper suffered an irreparable loss when cartoonist W. J. Kennedy left. Around 1882 he became interested in gold mining and sold his interest to E. H. Derrington. On 8 April 1884 Johnson was elected a member to the Electoral district of Onkaparinga in the South Australian House of Assembly, and was Minister of Education and of the Northern Territory from 11 June 1887 to 27 June 1889 in the Thomas Playford II Ministry. Johnson was the author of \"Moses and Me,\" the record of a visit paid to the Mount Brown diggings in 1880. Johnson held his seat of Onkaparinga until 24 April 1896. Johnson died in North Adelaide, South Australia, Australia on 18 June 1904, survived by an adopted son."

  "text" : "Franklin Bates Polson was a Canadian machinist and engineer, and co-founder with his father of the prominent Canadian shipbuilding firm the Polson Iron Works. Like his father William Polson, Franklin Bates Polson became a machinist and engineer, working for several Canadian railroads, until he and his father founded their shipbuilding firm in 1883.William Polson was the first President, and Franklin Bates Polson was the Secretary-Treasurer.Their firm built more than one hundred vessels, and built steam engines including for river boats constructed from local wood for service on rivers in Canada's then undeveloped west.Their firm built the Manitoba, said to be the first steel-hulled ship built in Canada, and the largest ship to sail on fresh-water.Their firm introduced the technique of designing vessels that could be disassembled. Vessels that were to serve on rivers in Western Canada were first assembled in the Polson shipyard, and then disassembled into sections that were small enough to fit on railway flatcars, for shipment to a landing on the river they were to service, for a second assembly and launch. In 1890 he became a director of the Parry Sound Lumber Company and the Parry Sound Navigation Company.The President of the Lumber Company, John Bellamy Miller, became an investor in the Iron Works. Miller in turn became a director of the Iron Works in 1892. Miller would eventually become the senior partner and President of the Polson Iron Works. The Polson Iron Works first shipyard was in Toronto, south of The Esplanade, between Sherbourne and Frederick.In 1888 the firm opened a second shipyard, on Lake Huron, at Owen Sound, a small yet growing city, with a railway connection.Owen Sound offered the firm an exemption from property tax. By 1895 Owen Sound City Council were reluctant to renew the property tax exemption, market conditions in the shipbuilding industry had changed, and the firm closed its Owen Sound location. Polson felt that the Federal government was unfairly subsidizing railroad industry, and that comparable subsidies should be offered to the shipping and shipbuilding industries.His efforts to lobby Ottawa were generally unsuccessful, with the exception of his efforts to court Joseph-Israël Tarte, the Canadian Minister of Public Works.Tarte commissioned the first of a series of dredges to enhance navigation of the St Lawrence River. During Polson's lifetime the firm built the CGS Vigilant, said to be the first Canada's first Canadian built armed vessel. Although Polson had a bout of typhoid fever, his sudden death at a relatively young age was unexpected."

  "text" : "Friedrich Edouard Heinrich Wulf Krichauff (15 December 1824 – 29 September 1904) was a politician in colonial South Australia. Krichauff was born in Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, the son of Carl Krichauff, a judge of the Supreme Court of the Duchy of Schleswig, and his wife Julie, née von Bertouch. Having passed through the State colleges of Schleswig and Husum, Krichauff served three years as an apprentice at the botanic gardens in connection with the University of Kiel. In 1846 he matriculated at the University of Berlin, and passed first class at examinations in Kiel. As a result he was allowed a stipend by the Danish Government to travel as gardener and botanist; but the war of 1848 prevented him from enjoying this privilege. Krichauff went to South Australia in December 1848, and settled at Bugle Ranges in the south. For many years he was the chairman of the District Council of Macclesfield, as well of the District Council of Strathalbyn. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for Mount Barker on 9 March 1857, but resigned on 12 March 1858. He was again elected to the House, this time for Onkaparinga on 5 April 1870, serving until 22 May 1882, when he resigned his seat to travel in Europe and America. After his return he was elected to the Assembly for the district of Victoria (8 April 1884), and continued to represent the constituency until his retirement from the House at the 1890 colonial election. Krichauff briefly served as a Minister in May 1870, when he was Commissioner of Public Works for twenty days in Henry Strangways' reconstructed Cabinet. He was returned to the South Australian Legislative Council in June 1890 for the Southern Province, holding the seat until 18 May 1894. Krichauff married Dora Fischer at Bugle Ranges on 10 May 1853. He died in Norwood, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia on 29 September 1904."

Longmore was the youngest son of George Longmore, a farmer in Monaghan, Ireland. He was educated at Mr. Blackey's Presbyterian Academy, Monaghan, and in 1839 went to Australia with the members of his family, who settled in New South Wales, where he followed farming pursuits till 1851, when he started business in Sydney as a commission agent. The next year he moved to Victoria, where from 1854 he farmed land in the Learmonth district. In 1856 Longmore began to take an active part in public affairs, being a strong opponent of the abuses of the land system. In 1859 he stood for Ripon and Hampden in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, but was defeated by James Service. In November 1864 he was successful against another opponent. In the Assembly he distinguished himself as a strong Liberal, Protectionist, and land reformer. He held office as commissioner of railways and Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works under Charles Gavan Duffy from June 1871 to June 1872, and was Minister of Lands under Graham Berry from August to October 1875. In the second Berry Government, which lasted from May 1877 till March 1880, he held the same position, distinguishing himself as a Minister by his vehement opposition to squatting and support of small settlement. Longmore was defeated for Ripon and Hampden in 1883, but represented Dandenong and Berwick from October 1894 to September 1897. Longmore died in Malvern, Victoria, Melbourne on 1 May 1898."

  "text" : "Frank Relle (born 1976) is an American photographer who lives and works in New Orleans, Louisiana. Best known for his long-exposure photographs of New Orleans architecture at night, Relle received national and international attention in early 2005 with \"New Orleans Nightscapes, \" which depicted, among its architectural subjects, homes in New Orleans’ 9th Ward in varying states of decay and dilapidation in the wake Hurricane Katrina. Using a combination of high-pressure sodium, mercury vapor, and daylight-balanced hot lights to light his subjects, Relle bathes his images in haunting color and light that invite the viewer to slow down and to see the familiar as uncanny. Relle's work is included in the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and in the permanent collection at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. His photographs have been printed in the New Yorker, the Southern Review, and the Oxford American, as well as many other regional and national publications. He is also the recipient of numerous awards, including a 2007 International Photography Award. Relle was also included in Photo Lucida’s Critical Mass Top 50 Photographers lists for 2007 and 2010."

From 1913 to 1920, he studied biology and medicine at the University of Vienna, during which time he made the acquaintanceship of zoologist Otto von Wettstein. In 1914 he collected herpetofauna specimens in Albania. From 1921 onward, he was assigned as a physician in the Dutch East Indies, being based on the island of Amboina, from where he made several zoological excursions to New Guinea and throughout the Moluccas. In 1924 he transferred to Java, being employed at the Pasteur Institute in Bandung, while in the meantime conducting studies of lizards and snakes native to the island. His name is associated with Kopstein's bronzeback snake (Dendrelaphis kopsteini ) as well as Kopstein's emo skink (Emoia jakati), a species described by Kopstein in 1926. Also, through a trilingual play on words, he is honored in the specific name of another skink, Sphenomorphus capitolythos, in the following way: capito + lythos (Greek) = \"head\" + \"stone\" (English) = Kopf + Stein (German)."

They devised the original Mizo alphabets based on Roman script, prepared the first book and dictionary in Mizo, started the first school among the Mizos. Mizoram has become the most Christian populated state in India.

Soldaat spoke to a Khayelitsha commission of inquiry in January 2014 about the 1995 rape. She said that the ill treatment she received at two police stations after the attack was devastating. Free Gender is a voice that calls out on homofobic and racist symptoms of society and called for a boycott of the 2014 Cape Town Pride event, alleging racism, with Soldaat claiming that the event excludes women and nonwhites and instead targeting money strong white gay guys (Event director Matthew van As disputed her claim.) Soldaat has been the subject of two short films, Ndim, Ndim (It's Me, It's Me), directed by Martha Qumbe in 2005, and Episode 2 of the SABC-commissioned series I Am Woman: Leap of Faith in 2013."

He teaches at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome and at RomaTre University and is also (sept. 2015) doctor honoris causa at Roskilde University in Denmark.

  "text" : "Franco Bracardi (16 May 1937 - 27 February 2005) was an Italian actor, composer, pianist and stand-up comedian. Born in Rome, during the first half of the fifties Bracardi began working as a jazz pianist in night clubs. In 1960 he became the pianist of The Flippers, a beat group which also included Lucio Dalla (sax, clarinet and vocals). Since mid-sixties he started composing songs for Mina, Mireille Mathieu and Raffaella Carrà, among others. During the same years he debuted as an actor and a comedian, performing at \"Setteperotto\", a small cabaret in Rome. He later starred in several films, mainly of humorous genre. Bracardi became famous in 1970, thanks to the radio variety show of Renzo Arbore and Gianni Boncompagni Alto gradimento (\"High liking\"), where he was the score composer, an author and where he also gave voice to some grotesque characters such as Solforio, Mortification and Pallottin. Later he became the official pianist of Maurizio Costanzo in his long lasting television show Maurizio Costanzo Show. He was the elder brother of Giorgio Bracardi."

Notable Norris projects include designing and developing \"Hollywood Park\" in 1959 at North Pacific Beach, San Diego—-an enclave of 13 mid-century homes; the residence of G.G. (Gilbert George) Budwig, aviation pioneer and early Director of Air Regulation for the U.S. Department of Commerce; and the Robert Martinet residence (former San Diego City Councilman). Both residences are located on Mission Bay, San Diego County and were featured in the Los Angeles Times when first built. In addition to numerous residential projects and a few commercial designs, Norris is credited with the design and supervision of the 1988 construction of the seawall on Ka'anapali Beach, Maui, located in front of the Maui Kai condo resort and known as the Fred Norris Seawall. A bronze plaque with his name is attached to the seawall."

Ghia appeared as an actor in the 1958 film La Gerusalemme liberata. He had a stint working as an agent for the William Morris Agency, and was taught to speak English by Albert Finney. In 1972 he read an article about the Jesuit order and political trouble in South America in Time magazine which generated a lifelong interest in it and formed the basis of several of the films he produced, including The Mission and the Italian series Nostromo. He spent over a decade in Hollywood, returning to his native Italy in the late 1980s and establishing Pixit Productions in Rome. In the 1990s Ghia married actress Gaia De Laurentiis, 35 years his junior; they had a son, Sebastian, in 1996. At his funeral in June 2005, Ennio Morricone's stirring theme for The Mission was reportedly played."

  "text" : "Frank Panabaker (1904–1992) was a painter of landscapes, with his focus on Southern Ontario. Panabaker was born in Hespeler, Ontario, the son of the local woollen Mill manager and one-time Mayor of the town, now part of Cambridge. He studied art in many locations, beginning in Hespeler under Farquhar McGillivray Knowles (1859–1932) and his wife, Elizabeth McGillivray Knowles. who gave him lessons, and his father was so encouraged that he was able to attend the Ontario College of Art under Arthur Lismer and J.E.H. MacDonald. He continued his artistic studies at the Grand Central School of Art in New York City, became an award-winning member of the Salmagundi Club also in New York. A self-supporting professional artist for his entire adult life, he began his painting career during the Great Depression in Hamilton, Ontario where he lived with his wife Katherine. He would drive across Southern Ontario, to the shores of Georgian Bay, through Haliburton, Muskoka and Algonquin Park painting in all seasons, in all kinds of weather. He ventured to paint the Rockies several years, and even travelled abroad to Nassau and the British Isles. He was never without his painting box, making sketches and notes for when he was back in his studio where he worked-up his timeless images of what he had seen. He also marked the times by painting scenes of the Hamilton Farmer's Market, the Royal yacht Brittania in Hamilton Harbour and documenting the Steel City in all its elements and growth. He used various empty buildings in Hamilton for his one-man shows, once renting the old Birks building for an exhibition in 1933 where he sold eight paintings during the first four days. However, it was a visit to the gallery by Sara D. Roosevelt, mother of Franklin D. Roosevelt, that really boosted his fortunes as the Toronto \"Mail and Empire\" reported that Mrs. Roosevelt had purchased a small seascape. The artist sold 18 more pictures in the following two days. Early in his lengthy career, he was hired by Cootes-Hallmark to produce a painting of a winter scene each year, to be reproduced for Christmas cards and sold nationally. He was a long-standing member of the Allied Artists of America (one of a handful of Canadians ever to be elected), as well as an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy. He was a member of the board of trustees for the National Gallery in Ottawa for six years. He painted up until the last weeks of his life, dying at 87 in 1992. In 1996 Frank Panabaker was inducted into the Hamilton Gallery of Distinction."

  "text" : "Frank Rainer Glaw (born 22 March 1966 in Düsseldorf) is a German herpetologist working at the Zoologische Staatssammlung München. Glaw studied biology in Cologne from 1987, where he completed his diploma. Thereafter, he attended the University of Bonn, from which he graduated in 1989, after completing his Ph.D. thesis titled Untersuchungen zur Bioakustik, Systematik, Artenvielfalt und Biogeographie madagassischer Anuren about the frogs of Madagascar. Since 1997, he has been the curator of herpetology at the Zoologische Staatssammlung München. Glaw's focus during and after his thesis work was the herpetofauna of Madagascar. Since the end of the 1980s, he has been working closely with Professor Miguel Vences. Together, they published A Field Guide to the Amphibians and Reptiles of Madagascar in 1992, a benchmark work on the amphibians and reptiles of Madagascar, which, supported by the World Bank, was translated into Malagasy and made freely available online. It is now in its third edition. Glaw is a contributing author on over 100 descriptions of Madagascan taxa, such as the chameleon Brookesia micra, and the microhylid frog Stumpffia pygmaea"

  "text" : "Frances Marshall Eagleson (1898—1987) was born in Elizabeth, Kentucky, United States, on July 17, 1898 and raised in Rushville, Indiana. The first black woman to graduate from Indiana University, she graduated in 1919 with an associate degree in English and a teaching certificate. After a year of teaching in Florida she began teaching English at North Carolina Central College at Durham in 1921, but went on to earn a graduate degree in educational administration from the University of Chicago and Columbia. Eventually working as a registrar and admissions officer for North Carolina Central University from 1928 to retirement in 1964 (Currently has co-ed dormitory named in her honor - Eagleson Hall). After retirement, Marshall worked as the registrar for two other colleges: Florida Memorial College in St. Augustine, Florida, and Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. She was married to Wilson Vashon Eagleson (?-1933), another Indiana University graduate who taught chemistry and coached football at North Carolina Central University. They were the parents of 2nd Lt. Wilson Vashon Eagleson, a fighter pilot who flew with the 99th and 32nd Pursuit Squadron during the Second World War, and Rosaline M. Exum, who became an associate professor of mathematics at Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia. After retiring from her post at Spelman, Eagleson lived with her daughter in Hampton until her death on May 18, 1987. Eagleson remained active in the Indiana University alumni category, mentoring and housing students, and she has been honored by Indiana University beside Marcellus Neal for their scholastic and social achievements. The Neal-Marshall Alumni Club was founded in 1981 as a means of meeting the needs of black students, faculty, and staff, while also promoting African-American history at Indiana University. The organization was actually founded in Jackson, Mississippi, but Indiana chapters soon followed in Gary and Indianapolis. The Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center opened on the Indiana University campus in 1969. The center was originally called the \"Black House,\" but renamed the Black Culture Center in 1972. The center was located in various buildings on campus, but moved into its new home at 109 North Jordan Avenue in 2001 after years of effort by students, alumni, and administration. \"When I said I was going to college, people thought I was crazy,\" she said. \"It was unusual for a woman to go to college, especially a black woman.\""

Moreno Reinoso makes large, ornate bird cages from the reeds and bamboo often in the forms of churches and houses, as well as boxes for paper, laundry baskets, book shelves and other light furniture. He grows his own raw materials, and his house is filled with reeds and bamboo of various types along with machetes, knives, blades, chisels and pieces of leather. Once the materials are cut, he and the family prepare it though a process of selection and cleaning, generally splitting the reeds and bamboo in two or more lengths. Then they are soaked for over twelve hours and left covered to maintain moisture. Standing at his worktable, he pulls the needed pieces. Thicker ones are used for support, sometimes with cross pieces for larger works. He usually leaves the finished product unpainted but sometimes adds brown blotches by lightly burning certain areas. He has won various recognitions and awards for his work, including being named a “grand master” by the Fomento Cultural Banamex."

In 1889 he became an associate professor, and from 1893 to 1931 was a full professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Basel. In 1900 he was named university rector. Zschokke is best known for his work in the field of hydrobiology (lake fauna) and for his zoogeographical studies of Central European wildlife. He was an instructor to Adolf Portmann and a good friend of explorer Fridtjof Nansen. In 1927, with Portmann and Nansen, he published \"Nordland: Eine Ferienfahrt nach Norwegen und Spitzbergen\" (Northland, an excursion to Norway and Spitzbergen). In 1892 he became member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina. After his death, a donation enabled the construction of the \"Zschokke house\", a building located on the Gerschnialp, at the foot of the Titlis, in the ski and hiking resort of Engelberg. Today the structure is used for weekend seminars and workshops."

In 1695 he relocated to Vienna, where he joined the Society of Jesus. There he began to collect material for what was to become Illyricum sacrum - a work on the history of countries that were a part of the former Roman province of Illyricum. He continued to collect historical material during the service in Jesuit colleges in Gorizia, Rijeka and Trieste, and during the missionary stay in Dalmatia (1709-1715). In 1716 he went to Venice, whence he was reassigned to the Jesuit college in Padua with the task of completing the ecclesiastical history of Illyricum. In his work on collecting, studying and arranging the material he received help from the Archbishop of Split, Pacifico Bizza. In 1720 the first draft of the work was published. In 1729 it was decided that the work will also cover the secular history of Illyricum, and in 1740 the second draft was published. Until his death Riceputi has compiled a comprehensive introduction to Illyricum sacrum, and the work was completed by his colleagues Daniele Farlati and Giovanni Giacomo Coleti. He died in Cesena."

Whipple received a Nobel Prize in 1934 in recognition of this work, but Robscheit-Robbins was not recognised in this award, although Whipple did share the prize money with her. Robscheit-Robbins was described in 1981, as a woman \"of considerable presence\" who was often seen wearing diamonds and with \"elegantly coiffured\" hair. In 2002, a Discover magazine article entitled \"The 50 Most Important Women in Science\" noted that the contributions of Robscheit-Robbins \"deserve greater notice\"."

After the Battle at St. Croix, he also arrested the Acadians who killed Cornwallis' messenger. In March 1750, Cornwallis wrote, \"Gorham is no officer at all; Capt. Bartelo, I can confided in as a good officer, and an honest man.\" In April, Bartelo was appointed the commander of all the independent companies in Nova Scotia. In September, Cornwallis gave command of Gilman's rangers to Captain Bartelo.) He was the commander at Fort Sackville in August 1750, when he served as second in command at the Battle at Chignecto. On August 26 Salusbury recorded that the Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias killed him in the battle. Apparently unaware of Bartelo's death, in September of 1750, Cornwallis wrote, \"The command of the Rangers is given to capt. Bartelo, a good officer, and one I can confide in. He has both prudence, activity and courage. Gorham has my leave to go home, as he represents to me great sums are due him for raising and keeping up that company before I came here. He has the king's commission. Though I think him no officer, I can (not) dismiss him.\""

Pianta was one among a group of sculptors working in Venice. They worked only with wood. Pianta was the most popular among these sculptors. The works of Pianta were known for their fanciful or bizarre themes. But he still was a sought-after sculptor, with some of the wealthiest people as his patrons. Several of his works survive today, but his most famous work is wooden panels series with allegorical secular figures housed in the hall of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco."

In 1698 he became violinist in the court chapel of Electorate of Hanover, where he had married in the previous year. There is some evidence suggesting that he originated from present-day Belgium because his sons are recorded in the baptismal register as \"Bruxellensis\" (= from Brussels). In 1714, Venturini was named Kapellmeister, head of the court orchestra, and held this post until his death. He was a renowned composer in his time. He created chamber music, concerts and other works essentially in the suite form. His Concertos Op. 1 were printed 1715 by Estienne Roger in Amsterdam."
