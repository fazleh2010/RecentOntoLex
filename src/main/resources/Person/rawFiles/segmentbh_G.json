  "text" : "Glenn McLean (born 10 July 1961) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Melbourne and Collingwood in the Victorian Football League (VFL). McLean, whose father Tom was a Melbourne player in the 1950s, attended Moorabbin Technical School and played his early football at Beaumaris. He came to Melbourne from Sandringham in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). A ruckman, McLean managed just three senior VFL appearances in 1980 and 1981. McLean was however regularly selected in 1982, with veteran Garry Baker on the sidelines because of a knee injury and another ruckman Michael Byrne crossing to Hawthorn. McLean played in nine of the first ten rounds that year, before breaking his wrist, but returned to finish with 15 games for the season. In the 1983 VFL season he shared ruck duties with Brownlow Medalist Peter Moore and was the only Melbourne player to appear in all 22 rounds. McLean finished fifth in Melbourne's best and fairest. In 1984, McLean was the centre of controversy over his attempt early in the season to move from Melbourne to Collingwood. The clearance wrangle went to the supreme court and McLean was eventually let go by Melbourne, in a trade which secured the club Tony Keenan. He played in rounds 15 and 16, before losing his place in the Collingwood team. In January 1986, McLean was one of five players sacked by the club, along with Graeme Allan, Allen Eade, Tony Kelly and Jim McAllester. McLean's brother Paul played one game for VFL club Fitzroy in 1987."

  "text" : "Gertrud Grunow (8 July 1870 – 11 June 1944) was a German composer, associated with the Bauhaus design school where she taught courses on musical composition and theory. In late 1919 Grunow approached the Swiss painter and designer Johannes Itten, and proposed that she give lectures at the Bauhaus on harmony. Grunow remained a supporter of Itten during her time at the school. She began teaching at the school from the end of 1919. Employed initially as an assistant teacher, Grunow taught a course on 'Harmonisation theory' at the Bauhaus from 1919 to 1923. Grunow was not universally popular among students at the Bauhaus, with one complaining of her methods that \"She was convinced that she could place us, the students, by means of music and a self-induced trance state into an inner equilibrium that would strengthen and harmonize our creative powers.\" Grunow also claimed that she could develop any faculty, even boxing. Born in Berlin, Grunow formulated theories of the relationships between sound, colour and movement, and held her first lectures on her theories in Berlin in 1919. After the Bauhaus she taught between 1926 and 1934 in Hamburg, and internationally, teaching for several months in England and Switzerland in the late 1930s. Grunow returned to Germany in the Second World War, and died in Leverkusen in 1944. Her personality has been described as \"extremely sensitive and sensitive to occultism\"."

  "text" : "George Henry Ford aka G. H. Ford (20 May 1808 London - July 1876 London), was a South African natural history illustrator of exceptional merit who joined the British Museum in 1837. At first he portrayed animals and produced the plates in Sir Andrew Smith’s Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa (1838-1847). He was the son of an English farmer in the Cape, James Edward Ford, who was himself a talented miniaturist. Capt. James Edward Ford, one of the 1820 Settlers, was born in England in 1770, and emigrated to South Africa, landing at Port Elizabeth in April 1820. His wife was Frances Stransham 40, and with their 7 children, they were members of Bailie's Party of 256 Settlers on the ship \"Chapman\". The area allocated to the Party lay midway between Bathurst and the Great Fish River mouth and was named Cuylerville after Col. Jacob Cuyler. The children were Frances Jane Ford 14, James Samuel Ford 13, George Henry Ford 11, Edward Stransham Ford 9, Adelaide Elizabeth Ford 8, Jane Murray Ford 6, and John Henry Ford 3. Andrew Smith made the acquaintance of the Ford family in 1821 when he was visiting farmers, urging them to provide him with specimens of interest. Young George Ford was suffering from a broken hip inflicted by a cow, an injury which left him permanently crippled, causing Smith to take him back to Cape Town. While convalescing there he was encouraged to paint and draw Smith's specimens. He proved to be so proficient that in 1825 Smith recommended him to the newly founded South African Museum in Cape Town, and later seconded him to the 1834-36 \"Expedition for Exploring Central Africa\". A report on this expedition was \"Illustrations of the zoology of South Africa, consisting chiefly of figures and descriptions of the objects of natural history collected during an expedition into the interior of South Africa, in the years 1834, 1835, and 1836, fitted out by The Cape of Good Hope Association for Exploring Central Africa, together with a summary of African zoology, and an inquiry into the geographical ranges of species in that quarter of the globe\". When Smith returned to England in 1837, Ford accompanied him and found immediate recognition for the quality of his work. He was employed at the British Museum and worked there with Smith who was finally driven away by the discomfort of the Bloomsbury semi-basement. Ford continued working under John Edward Gray, assistant to the Keeper of Zoology. Ford, because of chronic backache, eventually worked from the Surbiton home of Albert Günther who was to succeed Gray in 1875. George Viner Ellis (1812-1900) succeeded to the Chair of Anatomy at University College London in 1850, and became one of the foremost anatomists of his time. This institution, in its first thirty-five years of existence, published an extraordinary number of anatomical atlases. Ellis and Ford used the relatively new technique of chromolithography for their imperial folio atlas of fifty-eight plates, \"Illustrations of Dissections in a Series of Original Coloured Plates the Size of Life\". The plates were done between 1863 and 1867, with from four to seven completed each year. These plates are considered exceptionally clear and accurate, with an aesthetic depiction of the cadavers, printed by the Mintern Bros., and published by James Walton.

  "text" : "George Viner Ellis FRS (25 September 1812 Minsterworth - 25 April 1900 Minsterworth) was Professor of Anatomy at University College London and one of the foremost anatomists of his time. George Viner was the second son of Viner Ellis of Duni House, Minsterworth, near Gloucester, his family having been landowners in the area for many years. His education was at the Crypt Grammar School from where he went to the Cathedral Grammar School, and later was apprenticed to a Dr Buchanan of Gloucester. His uncle, Daniel Ellis, a member of the Royal Society Edinburgh, suggested that he enrol as a medical student at the newly founded University College London. In his vacations he studied in Paris and attended lectures and worked at anatomy in Berlin. Ellis was Demonstrator of Anatomy under Professor Richard Quain, and succeeded him in the Chair of Anatomy in 1850, retiring as Emeritus Professor in 1877, but always aloof from the professional world. He was succeeded by Sir George Dancer Thane (1850-1930). Ellis was one of the great names of the world of anatomy in England, having given all his working life to the study and teaching of this discipline, and was held in the highest respect. His lectures were conscientiously precise and lucid, so that his students always paid close attention. In 1840 he published \"Demonstrations of Anatomy: being a Guide to the Knowledge of the Human Body by Dissections\", his name becoming a household word among medical students, and his work becoming the standard textbook in England and the United States. The 11th edition of his book was published in 1890. University College London in its first thirty-five years of existence, published an extraordinary number of anatomical atlases. Ellis carried on this tradition by collaborating with the South African natural history illustrator, George Henry Ford, to produce some of the best anatomical artwork ever published. They used the relatively new technique of chromolithography for their imperial folio atlas of fifty-eight plates, \"Illustrations of Dissections in a Series of Original Coloured Plates the Size of Life\". The plates were done between 1863 and 1867, with from four to seven completed each year. These plates are considered exceptionally clear and accurate, with an aesthetic depiction of the cadavers, printed by Mintern Bros., and published by James Walton. During Ellis' tenure the University College London was regarded as the pre-eminent centre for the study of anatomy, its spacious and well-lit dissecting room approved of by both staff and students. The College was fortunate in acquiring and retaining the services of an anatomist of Ellis' stature - his culture, zeal, and energy were legendary - receiving only a moderate salary and with no prospect of career improvement. In Ellis' day cadavers were not treated with any preservatives, so that they were often in an advanced state of putrefaction, limiting dissection to the winter months. Several times he acted as Examiner in Anatomy at the University of London, but declined to join the Court of Examiners of the Royal College of Surgeons. On his retirement Ellis came into a small fortune left him by a relative, built himself a house at Minsterworth, 'Severn Bank', and lived there quietly with his younger sister, devoting himself to gardening and apple-growing. He also ran night classes for the older boys of the parish. A few years before his death he became blind and was tended by his sister. \"Ellis' muscle\", the Corrugator cutis ani muscle, is named after him."

His father and uncle were both Sanskrit scholars. It was this family tradition of studying the archaic language of the sub-continent that led to Gautama attending a Sanskrit school called Samsodhana Mandala. The school itself was set up by his father, who was wary of the Western schooling model of holding exams."

  "text" : "Gary George \"Griz\" Johnson (December 18, 1938 – December 22, 2012) was a longtime figure in professional baseball who, at various points, played, managed and scouted. Prior to playing professionally, Johnson attended Huntington Beach High School and then Orange Coast College. A first baseman, Johnson played in the minor leagues for 11 seasons, from 1958 to 1967. He began his career at 19 years old, hitting .282 with 49 hits in 50 games split between the Class-D Dubuque Packers and Class-D- Holdrege White Sox in 1958. In 1959, he played for the Clinton Pirates and hit .277 with five home runs in 115 games. He played for the Class-B Lincoln Chiefs in 1960 and hit .230 with one home run, 50 RBI and 13 stolen bases in 130 games. He returned to Lincoln for 1961 and hit .289 with one home run and 122 hits in 110 games. He played for the unaffiliated Class-B Tri-City Braves in 1962, but was still part of the White Sox system. That season, he hit .341 with 178 hits, 35 doubles, 10 triples, 89 runs scored and 103 RBI in 135 games. He led the Northwest League in hits and RBI, tied Nelson Mathews for the lead in triples, placed second behind Ethan Blackaby in doubles and total bases and was third in at-bats. Back in the White Sox system in 1963, he hit .292 with eight home runs, 74 RBI and 15 stolen bases for the Double-A Lynchburg White Sox. He was second in the South Atlantic League in doubles, behind Mel Corbo. He split 1964 between Lynchburg and the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians and hit .286 with 15 home runs, 102 RBI, 35 doubles and 10 triples in 159 games. The next year, again with Indianapolis, he hit .251 with ten home runs and 51 RBI in 142 games. In 1966, he played for the Double-A Evansville White Sox and Indianapolis and hit .273 with eight home runs and 70 RBI in 112 games and in 1967, he hit .280 with one home run and 58 RBI in 137 games for Evansville. Overall, he hit .280 with 1,289 hits and at least 61 home runs in 1,228 games. In 1968, he began the season as the Appleton Foxes manager, but was replaced by Evansville White Sox manager Stan Wasiak in late July and took over for Wasiak in Evansville. He managed the Columbus White Sox in 1969. He remained with the White Sox system for 25 more years, working as a scout and scouting director. In the early 1970s, along with Marty Keough he launched the Scout League of Southern California, where top high school players participated. He then joined the Texas Rangers system as a scout, where he remained for two seasons. He last worked for the Kansas City Royals for 27 seasons. For the White Sox, he signed, among others, Francisco Barrios and Cecil Espy. He signed Jim Campbell, Shane Costa, Donnie Murphy, Ed Pierce, Bob Hamelin and Matt Treanor for the Royals. He is a member of the Daily Pilot Sports Hall of Fame."

  "text" : "Glenn Howard (born 17 November 1962) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Hawthorn and Collingwood in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Recruited from Burwood United, Howard had an injury plagued VFL career, which started in 1981 after making his way up from the Under 19s. He made seven appearances late in the season, then played only the opening two rounds in 1982 and just once in 1983, a premiership year. In both the 1984 and 1985 seasons, Howard didn't play a single senior game. He finally had an extended run in the team in 1986, with 13 games, but didn't take part in Hawthorn's finals campaign, which ended in a fourth successive grand final appearance and second premiership in four years. In 1987 he played 14 games for Collingwood, but didn't play at all in 1988 and was cut from their list at the end of the year. He suffered two broken legs during his career. He was captain of the Sandringham Football Club in 1989 and 1990, winning their best and fairest in the first of those years."

  "text" : "Godfrey Pilkington (8 November 1918 - 8 July 2007) was an art dealer, director and co-founder of the Piccadilly Gallery Pilkington is remembered for his work at the Piccadilly Gallery and in the community of St. Helen's from where his family operated Pilkington Glass from 1826 to 2006. Together with his wife Eve and Christabel Briggs, Pilkington enjoyed over half a century of trade with the Piccadilly, avoiding the prevailing commercialism and the fashion for abstract art. He championed the works of neglected figurative artists, Art Nouveau and 19th and 20th Century Symbolism. In December 2006 the Rainford Gallery in St Helens, Merseyside was renamed the Godfrey Pilkington art gallery after the gallerist. Pilkington loved cycling through London from home to work. Unfortunately he was hit by a car in the Hyde Park underpass and died on 8 July 2007."

He was the favorite pupil of Bronner and in 1934 the winner of the Dutch Prix de Rome. With the annuity of the Prix de Rome, he lived with his wife, the artist Annetje Meijs, three years in Rome and in Paris. After his return again in the Netherlands he settled in Amsterdam, where he lived his entire life. In 1938 his application for membership of the Dutch Society of Sculptors in Amsterdam was first rejected. After the so-called \"Bolhuis incident\" in which seven members (among others John Rädecker and Han Wezelaar) quit the organisation, Bolhuis finally was accepted as a member. After World War II he made resistance and liberation monuments in the Dutch municipalities Winterswijk, Epe, Beverwijk and Amsterdam. Bolhuis died in 1975 and was buried in Amsterdam."

  "text" : "Guillaume Gallozzi, (11 February 1958, Aix-en-Provence – 25 December 1995, Paris) was a French art dealer associated with graffiti art. He lived and worked in New York and rose to prominence in the 1980s and '90s through his promotion of graffiti pioneers and, later, of British art. He had a reputation for being quixotic, brilliant and stylish (\"more worthy of a novel than a brief obituary,\" per The Independent), and played a role in the careers of significant artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Stan Peskett and Steven Sykes. In the early 1980s Gallozzi and partner Joe La Placa (the latter went on to found All Visual Arts in London in 2007) opened the Gallozzi-La Placa Gallery in New York's TriBeCa. In 1981 Gallozzi had presented the first significant solo exhibition of Stan Peskett's installation art in New York, subsequently becoming Peskett's dealer. In the mid-1980s Gallozzi diversified into representing Italian Futurists, the Hudson River School and British surrealists, and mounted notable exhibitions until 1988, when the Gallozzi-La Placa Gallery ceased active operations. In the meantime, however, Stan Peskett had introduced Gallozzi to the drama of war art, specifically to British war artists and, in 1989, working with The British Council USA (cultural department of the British Embassy in Washington DC) and its then cultural affairs officer Barbara Rosen, Gallozzi mounted a show of British war artists at the Navy Museum in Washington DC. Several of Gallozzi's catalogs, including those on war art, are collectors items, other examples being Metamorphose: British Surrealists and Neo-romantics (1992), and Back in No Time (1994), a catalog featuring works of painter and performance artist Brion Gysin. The only criticism leveled at Gallozzi during the final few years of his life is that his tastes had become, if anything, too sophisticated, or \"decidedly récherché\" as The New Yorker put it. Gallozzi died in Paris on Christmas Day, 1995, aged 37, having fought brain cancer for five years."

  "text" : "In 1972 American suspicions had triggered one of Brunet's colleagues, Leslie James Bennett, to lose his security clearance, leading to his dismissal.A year after Brunet's death, a Soviet defector named Vitaly Sergeyevich Yurchenko would clear Bennett, and assert that Brunet was the mole. Brunet was the son of Josaphat Brunet, the first director of the RCMP Security Service. According to The Fifth Estate, Gilles Brunet lived beyond his means, and made frequent trips to Mexico.His father would rise to the rank of Deputy Commissioner. Brunet joined the RCMP Security Service in the early 1960s, and at first, seemed to show promise that would merit holding greater positions of trust. He was offered Russian Language training, and did well.He played a significant role in the conviction of Bower Featherstone, and won a promotion in 1966. But Brunet was drinking too much, and his marriage was in trouble because his wife, correctly, believed he was sexually unfaithful to her. According to Secret Service: Political Policing in Canada -- from the Fenians to Fortress America, Brunet enlisted as a Soviet informant in January 1968.Later in 1968, his wife, looking for traces of his infidelities, found a $2,000 payment from the Soviets in his car. She reported the suspicious funds to the RCMP, and her report was dismissed because Brunet had warned colleagues that his jealous wife would say anything to bring him down. Brunet betrayed Nikolai Artamonov, a Soviet who had found political asylum in the USA.After making his way to the USA, and seeking asylum, Artamonov started working with the Defense Intelligence Agency. Soviet agent Igor Kochnov approached Artamonov, and invited him to return home. While Artamonov pretended to agree, and to meet someone to handle his extraction, in Montreal, he informed his FBI handler. Because the meet was in Canada, the RCMP Security Service became involved, and Brunet told his handlers that Artamonov's negotiations to return home were a trap. No one was captured in Montreal, but the Soviets caught up with Artamonov two years later in Vienna, where he died of a drug overdose when they tried to abduct, drug and repatriate him. Brunet was still receiving glowing performance reviews as late as 1972.In 1973 however he and colleague, Donald McCreery, were fired in 1973, because it was believed they had ties to organized crime figures in Montreal. After they were fired Brunet and McCreery founded a private security firm. In 1977 Brunet and McCreery were key witnesses before the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP.According to Crimes by the Capitalist State, the pair testified about \"barn burning, the theft of documents, and 'participation and assistance to the CIA in offensive activities in Canada.'\" According to the Historical Dictionary of Air Intelligence, Brunet still had knowledge of the handling of Soviet defectors in 1978 [sic].The book asserts Brunet told his handlers that Vladimir Vetrov had not been emphatic in rejecting recruitment efforts by the RCMP, which triggered an investigation into Vetrov's loyalty to the Soviet Union, that, in turn, triggered hard feelings that led him to leak secrets about how the Soviets covertly copied western military and technology projects to French agents. According to Moles, Defectors, and Deceptions: James Angleton and CIA Counterintelligence, Brunet died of a heart attack shortly before the RCMP was going to interview him about whether he was a mole.Some sources say he died in 1984, some say 1985. Nigel West, in a book profiling the directors of Britain's MI6, asserted that the RCMP didn't begin investigating Brunet until their suspicions were confirmed by MI6.West claimed \"SIS's contribution greatly enhanced the Service's standing across the Atlantic...\""

  "text" : "Georg Christian Wilhelm Haas (June 5, 1751 or 1756 – May 10, 1817) was a Danish engraver. Born and initially working in Hamburg, two of his brothers Peter and Meno, and his father Jonas all were engravers. Haas visited as a child the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, where he quickly made much progress in art. In 1776, when he was 20–21 years old, he won the gold medal. This brought the right to go abroad as the Academy \"boarder\" , but travel grants seemed slow in coming and were both few and small, for Haas' case only 100 Rdl. customary annual two or three years. Although one in Paris would not get far with this insignificant sum, it gave Haas, however, enough to get on the road to France's capital, where he arrived and was able to study under Nicolas de Launays and Johan Frederik Clemens. After in 1781 to have had his scarce scholarship increased and prolonged studied Haas eagerly went ahead and completed in 1782 a beautiful wall Diomedes eaten up by his own horses. On the basis of this, Haas was a member of the Academy in Paris and also in January 1783 the Academy in Copenhagen, to which city he almost simultaneously thus returned. Being a member of two academies was a prudent, but Haas needed to find employment. But he had difficulties with this, because the time was cool to both the arts and artists. In addition, there was no shortage of engravers in Denmark, and there were more artists than Haas (Clemens, Johan Martin Preisler) . Haas searched in vain for a professorship at the model school, and unsuccessfully for free residence at Kunsthal Charlottenborg, nothing would initially succeed him. He got the title of hofkobberstikker and an annual allowance of the King's box, but the work was limited, and his circumstances were cramped. In 1810 he managed to become a professor at the model school, but this late tailwind did not improve his circumstances, he was poor and remained poor. In 1811 he was auditor and treasurer at the Academy. Haas was already an old man when he in 1809 got the time and could afford to marry. His wife was called Johanne Christine, née Sønderup. Haas died in Copenhagen May 10, 1817, his wife died 1835. Haas is buried in Assistens Cemetery."

  "text" : "Vernon Gerald Bailey (1903-12 May 1975), was a prominent British peace campaigner and Liberal Party politician who was an early pioneer of a Popular Front later advocated by Sir Stafford Cripps. He was the son of Vernon Bailey of Clitheroe, Lancashire. He was educated at Bootham School, York and Clare College, Cambridge. He was the Liberal candidate for the Petersfield Division of Hampshire at the 1929 General Election. He was a Quaker and a committed pacifist. In 1930 he was appointed the Directing Secretary of the National Peace Council.Bailey was re-selected by Petersfield Liberals to contest the next General Election. Following the formation of the National Government in September 1931 a general election was called. Bailey started his campaign, but when it became clear that his Conservative opponent was being endorsed by not only the Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin but also the Prime Minister Ramsay Macdonald, Bailey withdrew on 14 October. Bailey believed that the Conservative dominated National Government could only be defeated if supporters of the Liberal and Labour parties came together locally to support a single candidate. To this end he stood as an Independent Progressive candidate for the Aldershot Division of Hampshire at the 1935 General Election. His candidature had the support of both local Liberal and Labour parties. In 1948 he played a leading role at Geneva in the formation of the World Union of Peace Organisations. In 1949 he resigned from his position at the National Peace Council. Bailey was the author of a number of books on Peace, including Peace with Russia? (1950), The Politics of Peace (1963) and Problems of peace (1970)."

  "text" : "Gary Don Stubblefield (born 1951) is a farmer from rural Branch in Franklin County in western Arkansas, who has been since 2013 a Republican member of the Arkansas State Senate. His District 6 encompasses Franklin, Johnson, Logan, and Yell counties, including the cities of Booneville, Ozark, and Clarksville. From 2011 to 2013, he was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from District 67 in Franklin County. Stubblefield graduated in 1969 from County Line High School in Branch, Arkansas. He attended the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, where he played football from 1969 to 1971 for the Arkansas Razorbacks. A dairy farmer, Stubblefield owns Valley View Farms in Branch. He formerly served as a member of the County Line School Board and on the Franklin County Quorum Court, equivalent to the county commission in most states. He and his wife, Kathi Lynn Stubblefield, have two children. Stubblefield was elected to the state Senate on November 6, 2012, when he defeated the Democrat John Paul Wells, a furniture store owner and a former member of the Arkansas House from Paris in Logan County, who was allied with Governor Mike Beebe. A pro-life legislator, Stubblefield voted to ban abortions after twenty weeks of gestation or whenever the fetal heartbeat is determined. He voted to declare the death of a fetus as a felony in certain situations. Stubblefield explains, \"As someone born and raised in rural Arkansas, I understand the importance of conservative family values. I have stood up for the rights of the unborn child, and I will always protect their rights as a state senator.\" As a representative, Stubblefield voted to allow university and college staff to carry concealed weapons on campus to enhance security. He voted to require picture identification for voting. He voted to allow the sale in Arkansas of unpasteurized whole milk. He voted for a spending cap on state spending; this passed the House by two votes. In 2011, he opposed the ban on cell phones, which was implemented in school zones for safety reasons. In 2013, Senator Stubblefield voted for a Republican bill to amend state income taxes. He supported legislation to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan. He voted to test recipients of unemployment compensation for narcotics. He also voted to reduce benefits to the unemployed. Stubblefield did not vote on a failed proposal to require a racial-impact statement regarding crimes."

Davis was born in Worcestershire, England, the son of William Davis, a carpet manufacturer, and Parthenia, née Potter. George emigrated to Victoria around 1850, and took a prominent part in municipal affairs in Emerald Hill, (later renamed South Melbourne), one of the suburbs of Melbourne. Subsequently he removed to Gippsland and embraced pastoral pursuits, taking a keen interest in horse-breeding and racing. Davis was president of the Victorian Farmers' Union. Having unsuccessfully contested the Electoral district of North Gippsland in the Victorian Legislative Assembly six times from 1864 to 1886, he was returned for the Gippsland Province in the Victorian Legislative Council in September 1888. When the James Munro Government was reconstructed under William Shiels, Davis, who was looked on as one of the leaders of the country party in Parliament, accepted a position in the Cabinet, and was sworn in as Minister of Defence in March 1892, a position he held until 23 January 1893. Davis was a member of the Legislative Council until his death in Caulfield, Victoria on 25 August 1896."

  "text" : "Gordon Fode (born 5 August 1971) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Fode made his debut as a 17-year-old in the last round of the 1988 VFL season. He went on to play all 22 games the following season, before hamstring injuries restricted him to only 4 games in the next three seasons. A move forward during the 1993 AFL season saw him kick 17 goals from 11 matches, and he was tipped to be an important player in St Kilda's future. However after only nine games in 1994 and 5 in 1995 he was delisted by St Kilda. Hawthorn drafted Fode with the 5th selection in the 1996 Pre-season Draft, but he never managed a senior game for Hawthorn. He retired from the AFL at the end of the 1996 AFL season and attempted to switch sports to play soccer, trying out for the Melbourne Knights. Fode had played soccer as a junior, and his father Marko Fode was a state representative goalkeeper, but he was overlooked for a contract with the Knights."

  "text" : "Gottlob Eduard Linck (20 February 1858, Ötisheim – 22 December 1947, Jena) was a German mineralogist. From 1879, he studied at the polytechnic college in Stuttgart, followed by classes at the Universities of Strasbourg and Tübingen. In 1888 he was habilitated for mineralogy and petrography at Strasbourg, where in 1894, he became an associate professor. Later the same year, he was named professor of mineralogy and geology at the University of Jena, a position he maintained until his retirement in 1930. On five different occasions, he served as university rector at Jena. His wide-ranging research covered many facets of geology and mineralogy. He examined the various properties of lime, gypsum and dolomite, and investigated the adsorption of potassium by clay minerals, especially kaolin. In 1893 he demonstrated that twinning was the cause of Neumann lines found in hexahedrite. His interest in chemical problems associated with geology led to his creation of the journal Chemie der Erde. Linck was a founding member of the German Mineralogical Society and served as editor of its journal Fortschritte der Mineralogie, Kristallographie und Petrographie (since 1911)."

  "text" : "Giuseppe De Notaris (18 April 1805, Milan – 22 January 1877) was an Italian botanist generally known for his work with cryptogams native to Italy. He studied medicine at the University of Pavia, obtaining his medical degree in 1830. Having developed an interest in botany, by 1832 he had abandoned the field of medicine. In 1836 he accepted an assignment at the botanical garden in Turin, and a few years later, was named professor of botany and director of the botanical garden at the University of Genoa (1839). In 1872 he was appointed chair of botany at the University of Rome. In the field of mycology, he proposed the fungi family Hypocreaceae (1845). With Antonio Bey Figari (1804-1870), he described numerous species from the family Poaceae. With Figari, he was the binomial co-author of the grass genus Schistachne (synonym Stipagrostis). Organisms with the specific epithet of notarisiana commemorate his name."

He studied as a pharmacist who had directed him also the father pharmacist (Pharmacy Seguenza still exists and is in the vicinity of the birthplace of the doctorate), gave himself to the study of geological and mineralogical sciences, from which he was drawn more. At twenty-three he discovered that all the products of the emanations of Vulcano (one of the Aeolian Islands) contain arsenic compounds. Later he published other scientific works that earned him the attention of scholars in Europe and the silver medal at the Paris Exposition.These works ensued the chair of Professor of Natural History at the high school Maurolico, then the Technical Institute of Messina and finally had access to the professorship at the University of Messina. Following performed other jobs around the metalliferous deposits of Fiumedinisi, land and fossils of the territory of Messina, and Calabria, which were awarded and published at his own expense by the Royal Academy of the Lincei. Giuseppe Seguenza died at the age of 56 and his son Luigi continued his work. One of three high schools Science high schools in Messina, Liceo Scientifico G. Seguenza, is named after him. The museum of Nizza di Sicilia, whose scientific officers are professors Domenica Saccà and Carmelo Saccà, is also dedicated to him. In 1868 he introduced the Zanclean stage to define the early part of the Pliocene. A genus of sea snails, known as Seguenzia (family Seguenziidae), is named in his honor."

When a court overturned Webster's win, Crafter contested a February 1980 by-election for his old seat and won. He held the seat until his defeat in 1993.

  "text" : "George Harker (1816 – 25 April 1879) was a businessman and politician in colonial Victoria (Australia), a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. Harker was born in Pateley Bridge, Nidderdale, Yorkshire, England, the son of Robert Harker and his wife Nancy, née Richardson.After education at local schools, Harker was at the age of thirteen apprenticed to a chemist at Harrogate. On the termination of his apprenticeship he was for some time dispensing assistant to a surgeon at Leeds, and subsequently carried on business as a chemist at Prescot, near Liverpool, where he was treasurer of the local Anti-Corn Law League. He married early in 1845, and left England for Victoria at the end of that year, arriving in February 1846. He bought property on the Yarra River which he farmed until 1850, when he started as a grain and produce merchant in Melbourne. In 1856 Harker retired from business, and was returned to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Collingwood in November 1856. He was Treasurer in the second John O'Shanassy Ministry from 10 March 1858 to 27 October 1859, when he resigned with his colleagues. At the general election in August 1859, he was defeated at Collingwood, but was returned for Maldon. In March 1860, Harker resigned his Maldon seat and revisited England, where he remained for two years. On his return he was re-elected for Collingwood in November 1864, which he represented until December 1865 and again from April 1871 to March 1874. Harker held many important public positions, including being the founding director of the Collingwood Gas Company, and died suddenly on 5 April 1879 in Melbourne."

He is a research associate for marine affairs at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, a visiting professor at the World Maritime University in Malmö, Sweden, and a Fellow of the International Association of Geodesy. He has authored and coauthored nearly 200 scientific articles and technical reports, and has presented papers and made scholarly addresses at international conferences, seminars and courses on five continents. He is a veteran UN maritime demarcation expert in the Law of the Sea, and was in 2010 appointed the chairman of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. He served as the secretary of the UN committee for Geodetic Aspects of the Law of the Sea (GALOS), as well as a member of the UN Advisory Board on the Law of the Sea (ABLOS). He has been consulted by governments on matters concerning maritime delineation, so he acted as ministerial advisor to: Commonwealth Secretariat of United Kingdom, Department of Foreign Affairs of Philippines, National Boundary Commission of Nigeria, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Oman, Executive Branch (COALEP) of Uruguay, Ministry of Lands and Resettlement of Namibia, Department of Foreign Affairs of Grenada, Ministry of Justice of Republic of Angola, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Guyana, Department of Foreign Relations (SRE) of Mexico, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Jamaica, Ministry of Land Use and Habitat of the Seychelles, South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency of Solomon Islands, Foreign Ministry of Kingdom of Tonga, Maritime Agency of Sierra Leone, and Petroleum Directorate of the Province of Nova Scotia in Canada. Besides his involvement in international maritime affairs, he has also acted as the special advisor in the 2002 inter-Canadian delineation case concerning right-of-access to marine oil reserves, between Newfoundland and Labrador on one side, and Nova Scotia on the other. As a UN official, he has been involved in resolving maritime disputes such as the 2012 dispute between Taiwan, China and Japan. In a 2013 Wikileaks release of secret documents regarding possible oil access dispute between Venezuela and Guyana, the foreign minister of Guayana Carolyn Rodrigues wrote on her country's 2011 submission to the UN for extension of Guayana's continental shelf: \"Dr. Carrera has worked hard and methodically to ensure that Guyana has the best submission possible and as the Minister of Foreign Affairs I wish to recognize his commitment and diligent work.\""

  "text" : "Gaylon Hooper White is an American columnist, communications consultant and author of The Bilko Athletic Club, a book about beer-loving, home run-hitting Steve Bilko and the 1956 Los Angeles Angels of the old Pacific Coast League. White graduated in 1967 from the University of Oklahoma with a bachelor’s degree in journalism-broadcasting. He was a sportswriter for the Denver Post, Arizona Republic and Oklahoma Journal before entering the corporate world and writing speeches for top executives at The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Control Data Corporation and Eastman Chemical Company. At Eastman, a manufacturer of plastics, chemicals and fibers, he established an award-winning website, the Eastman Innovation Lab, which uses storytelling to bridge the communications gap between the materials and design worlds. He was responsible for a highly acclaimed series of videos called Design Insights that featured thought-provoking interviews with some of the world’s top product designers. White received a personal recognition award from the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA) in 2010 for his support of design education and being a “great builder of bridges” between the manufacturing and design communities. In 2011, White was awarded an honorary lifetime membership in the IDSA. “At heart, Gaylon White is a storyteller,” Bob Grace of Plastics News wrote on White’s retirement from Eastman in 2012. “Others would do well to learn from his story.” The Los Angeles-born White was nine years old in 1955 when Bilko arrived in L.A. carrying the baggage of six failed big league trials. At the time, L.A. was a minor-league city with major-league dreams. Over the next three years, Bilko belted 148 home runs for the Angels to become known as “Stout Steve, the Slugging Seraph” and inspire “The Bilko Athletic Club” nickname for the mighty ‘56 Angels, widely considered baseball’s last great minor league team. Bilko returned to the majors in 1958 but never achieved the star status he enjoyed in the minors. Curious to find out why, White spent a day with Bilko at his home in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania shortly before he died in 1978 at age 49. White went on to interview more than a hundred players, including most of Bilko’s teammates on the ’56 Angels. In 2013, White started writing a monthly column on product design for Plastics News. He has authored some 100 articles on business and sports for international and U.S. publications. He also runs a communications consultancy, Orbiting Creative, LLC, that specializes in helping companies elevate and differentiate their innovation stories. White is a member of the IDSA and Society for American Baseball Research. He and his wife, Mary, live in Cartersville, Georgia. They have three children and seven grandchildren.

Due to his bizarre appearance in Rome on Palm Sunday 1484 he has been believed by some scholars to have not actually existed, but this has been contested with other reports that corroborate his eccentricities. His most notable follower was Lodovico Lazzarelli, an Italian humanist poet and alchemist, who writes his accounts of da Correggio in his Epistola Enoch."

  "text" : "Giuseppe Fraschieri (1808–1886) was an Italian painter. He was born in Savona. He initially trained at the Accademia Ligustica of Genoa, but then, under a stipend of the city of Savona, he went to study in the studio of Giuseppe Bezzuoli in Florence. In 1829, his drawing of the invention of painting won a first prize at the Accademia of Florence. He moved back to Sestri Ponente after a few years in Florence, interrupted by stays in Rome and London. In 1838, he was named Academic of Merit and Regent of the Painting classes at the Ligurian Academy. In 1842, he became director. From 1852 to 1869, he taught painting and color. His style was Romantic and among his pupils were Giacomo Ulisse Borzino, genre painter and portraitist; Antonio Caorsi; Giuseppe Ferrari; and Biagio Torrielli. In London he gained a number of portrait commissions. He died in 1886 in Sestri Ponente, Genoa."

  "text" : "Gary Frangalas (born 6 May 1963) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with the Sydney Swans and Richmond in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Frangalas, a Clayton recruit, played mostly across half back and half forward. He played with Sydney for three league seasons and didn't miss a single game in 1985. Based in Melbourne during that time, he was one of the Swans players requested by club management to make the move to Sydney for the 1986 season, but he instead joined Richmond, a club he had supported growing up. During his time at Richmond he struggled with injuries, including a torn knee cartilage. Frangalas joined Victorian Football Association club Dandenong in 1991. He played a part in the team's premiership winning season, but was a late withdrawal from the Grand Final itself due to a shoulder injury. He is of Greek descent."

The doctrine states that since the skull is incompressible, and the volume inside the skull is fixed then any increase in volume of one of the cranial constituents must be compensated by a decrease in volume of another.Previous research about George Kellie (1720–1779) may have been hampered by a widely cited incorrect year of birth, by the spelling of his name as Kellie or Kelly and by confusion with his father, also a surgeon in Leith, with the same name and subject to similar spelling variations."

Clark was born in Cambridge, England, where his father Colin Clark was a statistician who worked with Keynes at the University of Cambridge. The family moved to Australia in 1938 and Clark grew up there. He enrolled in the University of Oxford at the age of sixteen. After graduating from Oxford he joined the Australian foreign service in 1956, with which he was stationed in Hong Kong and Moscow in the early 1960s: he left the foreign service in 1965 due to his opposition to the Vietnam War, after having become proficient in Chinese and Russian. He came to Japan for the first time in 1967 as a doctoral student at Australian National University. In 1969 he became Tokyo bureau chief for The Australian newspaper and in 1975 was appointed consultant to the Policy Coordination Unit in the Australian Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. In 1976 he was made a professor of economics and comparative culture at Sophia University in Tokyo and served as president of Tama University from 1995 to 2001. He later served as vice president of Akita International University. Clark is a regular contributor to The Japan Times and is also active in farming and land development in the Boso Peninsula of Chiba Prefecture. He has served on more than twenty official policy-making committees in Japan."

Malcher or Jerzy Karol Malcher (11 July 1914 – 21 May 2001) was a writer, historian, and political analyst educated in the field of law at the Jagiellonian University of Kraków in the Interwar Poland. He is the author of two nominal books about the history of Poland and Polish-Soviet relations under Communist dictatorship: Poland's Politicized Army (1984), and Blank Pages, Soviet Genocide Against the Polish People (1993). During the Nazi German September campaign of 1939, Malcher escaped from a POW field hospital and in 1940 joined the Polish Armed Forces in the West led by General Sikorski. He served under British Command in Great Britain, North Africa and Italy mainly in intelligence services. Following World War II he did not return to new Soviet-controlled Poland and subsequently worked for over 30 years as a high-grade linguist in the British Civil Service in Hampshire where he lived. In 1958 George Malcher was awarded Membership of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his service with the U.K. Ministry of Defence."

  "text" : "George Blair Imrie (1885–1952) was a British architect of the Arts and Crafts movement renowned for his sensitive and individual house designs. He was born in Virginia Water, Surrey in 1885, lived for many years in Esher with his wife, Helen Maud Harrison, whom he married in 1910, and died in Salisbury, Wiltshire in 1952. His parents were James Blair Imrie, clerk of works (who had been born in Edinburgh) and Alice Stallwood. (He is not the son of architect, surveyor and civil engineer, Benjamin B. Imrie of Castle Douglas, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland as was once thought.) He is considered a proponent of the style now known as \"Tudorbethan\", along with architects such Norman Shaw, George Devey, Baillie Scott, Edwin Lutyens and the designer William Morris. His houses are renowned for their use of quality materials such as hand-made tiles and leaded lights, oak window frames and doors with wrought iron fittings yet often remain relatively modestly proportioned and low-key rather than showy and grand. Even at the time this \"liveability\" was noted; the 1924 book Small Family Houses by R. Randall Phillips mentions an Imrie and Angell house in Byfleet, Surrey. The aim of this book was \"to bring together a collection of houses suited to the needs of the small family. It is difficult to define just what accommodation may properly be embraced by such a term, but in a general way it has been taken to mean a house with two living-rooms on the ground floor and four or five bedrooms on the first floor.\" Many of Imrie's houses included state-of-the-art comforts of the time such as electricity in every room and \"fitted-lavatory basins\" with both hot and cold running water in all the bedrooms. His architectural practice, Imrie and Angell, was based at 2 Mitre Court Chambers in London with Thomas Gravely Angell. Prior to that he had been in partnership with E. H. Stodart and W. G. Pine-Coffin at Thanet House on the Strand and at Chipstead, Surrey, as architects, surveyors, land agents and valuers. Much of his work was in Surrey, most notably the fine Arts and Crafts houses of Clive Road and Clair Hill in Esher, built in the 1920s. His other houses include: \n*  a converted barn moved from Sussex to Reigate Road, Leatherhead in 1921;  \n*  85 Avenue Road, St John's Wood (1937); \n*  the Arts and Crafts gardens at Tusmore House in Oxfordshire;  \n*  the 1920s extension of Upper Terrace Lodge at Hampstead Heath; and  \n*  a house in Chilmark, Wiltshire, 1936. (Interestingly, a 1968 addition to the latter house was done by Warminster-based architects, Imrie, Porter and Wakefield, who practised mainly from the 1960s through to 1984. The firm's archive is held in the Wiltshire and Swindon Archives and includes G B Imrie's professional accounts books 1914-1937; G B Imrie's Petty Cash book 1937-1942; G B Imrie's Letters to the Times 1943-44, among others. Since Blair Imrie died in Salisbury in 1952, this firm may well have been his last professional partnership, which continued to use his name after his death. Another possibility is that a son or daughter continued in the practise.) His firm, Imrie and Angell, was also involved in with the development from 1912 to the late 1920s of 964 acres (390 ha) of land on St George's Hill, Weybridge, into a private estate intended for wealthy businessmen, centred on a golf course. Most notably among his non-residential work, Imrie's architectural practice won the competition to design the main building for the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley which was designed in 1914 and completed in 1916. The purpose-built, half-timbered, Surrey-style building known as the Laboratory is a focal point of Wisley and one of the first buildings seen on entering the gardens. It is also an early example of conservationism as the building was designed to be in keeping with the garden and was built using recycled materials from derelict properties."

In that year he began work as a journalist for the Goulburn Evening Penny Post before moving to Bellingen and editing the Raleigh Sun (1894–98). In 1901 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Raleigh, representing the Progressive Party. Following that party's collapse in 1907 he was one of the few members re-elected as a \"Former Progressive\", and he spent the next ten years sitting as an independent before joining the Nationalist Party in 1917. In 1920 he was elected as one of the members for Oxley representing the new Progressive Party, a forerunner of the Country Party, but he died at Lewisham later that year. He had married Annie Mary Taylor in 1905."

The collection is now in the Saratoga Springs History Museum. Bolster was born in Saratoga Springs in 1913 and exhibited an early interest in photography. He graduated from St. Peter's Academy in Saratoga Springs and opened a photography studio. In 1958 he took over the business of another well-known Saratoga Springs photographer, Harry B. Settle. Settle's collection contained negatives by J. S. Wooley, Gustave Lorey, Seneca Ray Stoddard, C.C. Cook, and H.C. Ashby in addition to Settle's own work. To this Bolster added a large collection he acquired from another photographer, Joe Deuel, plus his own numerous photos of the Saratoga scene. Bolster died in 1989 and willed his collection to the Saratoga Springs History Museum."

  "text" : "George Wolfgang Cleve (July 9, 1936 – August 27, 2015) was an Austrian-born American conductor. Born in Vienna, the son of Felix Cleve and the former Melitta Monheit, the family emigrated from Austria in 1938 after the Anschluss, and settled in New York City in 1940. Cleve studied at The High School of Music & Art and the Mannes College of Music. His conducting teachers included Pierre Monteux, who suggested Cleve as a substitute conductor for a concert at the Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, in 1960, which marked Cleve's professional debut. Cleve was music director of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra from 1968-1970. He subsequently served as music director of the San Jose Symphony from 1972 to 1992. He was respected, but also demanding, as musicians noted: 'Notorious for his moods and angry outbursts during rehearsals, Cleve could offend his players. Gilda Mazzanti, a violinist, once said, \"There were many pieces that we played with clenched teeth; if you only knew what we sometimes went through.\" Wendell Rider, the orchestra's principal horn during those years, agreed that Cleve \"was over the edge at times. But as far as the conducting -- it was inspiring,\" he said Thursday. \"There was always a commitment to finding the deepest meaning of the piece. He had that channel going.\"' \"Mr. Cleve had a long-standing reputation as a tempestuous, even tyrannical, collaborator, but that was a function of his high standards, [violinist Robin] Hansen said. 'He was difficult, but he was harder on himself than on anyone. He was all about integrity, and if you had that, then you were a colleague.'\" In 1974, Cleve co-founded the Midsummer Mozart Festival with Robert Hubbard and Wendell Rider, and served as its artistic leader from its founding until his death. In New York City, Cleve first conducted at the Mostly Mozart Festival in 1975 and at New York City Ballet in 2000, and subsequently appeared regularly with both organisations as a guest conductor. Cleve died at the age of 79 in Berkeley, California, from liver failure. He married Maria Tamburrino, a flutist, in 1986. He also has a son, Jeremiah Wiggins, from a previous relationship. His wife, son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter survive him."

He was a member of the Gereformeerde Kerk (or 'Dopper' church) and served as a ‘kerkraadslid’. Elected leader of the trekkers, he left Pretoria on 27 May 1874. Alberts led ten families across the Kalahari, taking 50 oxwagons and 1,400 cattle with them. He split the trek in three groups, with a two-day interval between them, to avoid overcrowding the rare waterholes along the path. Three families turned back before they crossed the Kgalagadi Desert, where a handful of cattle were lost during the waterless journey. Reaching Lake Ngami on 29 April 1875, they demanded Hendrik Matthys Van Zyl, a trader based in Ghanzi with a reputation for ruthlessness, access to his wells, but he initially refused. He ultimately agreed to let them have water, and the trekkers continued to Rietfontein, on the border with German Southwest Africa. The group arrived in Rietfontein in January 1876, and Andries Lambert, the Oorlams captain at Gobabis, granted them permission to stay. They remained for a year, leaving only when they received a call for help from the second party of Dorsland Trekkers; they had attempted to cross the Kgalagadi with 500 people in 128 wagons, more than could be supported by the desert environment. Alberts and his group managed to rescue some of them, and they continued their trek, reaching Okavango, where they were struck by malaria. Over a period of five years, the survivors arrived in the Humpata Highlands, in present-day Angola; where Alberts died in 1927."

  "text" : "Gabriel Sherman is an American author. In 2014, he wrote a biography about Fox News Channel president Roger Ailes called The Loudest Voice in the Room: How the Brilliant, Bombastic Roger Ailes Built Fox News – and Divided a Country, which debuted at #9 on The New York Times Bestseller list. He has written for The New York Observer and for New York magazine where he is a contributing editor. SF Gate called his biography of Ailes The Loudest Voice in the Room \"classic in a subgenre that might be called Enraged TV Executives Throwing Things.\" Sherman interviewed 600 people for the book, but did not have an interview with Ailes himself. Sherman portrays Ailes' leadership of Fox News as \"absolute\". Ken Kurson wrote that the Ze'ev Chafets' biography, Roger Ailes: Off Camera, released before Sherman's book, \"does a better job penetrating the psyche of Mr. Ailes (Mr. Chafets had extensive access to the wizard), and Mr. Sherman’s book does a better job depicting the phenomenon of Fox News and its cultural meaning.\" Fox News has denied many of the events depicted in the book. The book led to a number of media reports about Fox and its culture. Jay Ambrose said that readers \"should also not worry yourself to death about\" The Loudest Voice in the Room because Ailes is a \"fascinating if endlessly castigated man whose direction of Fox News divided nothing.\" In his September 19, 2016, \"Agendas\" column for the New York Observer conservative journalist Evan Gahr accused Sherman of a conflict of interest for writing about Fox News while negotiating with a job with chief competitor MSNBC and also not reporting purging allegations against MSNBC president Phil Griffin Sherman is married to Jennifer Stahl, an editor at ProPublica."

  "text" : "Geoffrey Osbaldeston (1558-c.1635) was an English born politician and judge who had a long but undistinguished career in Ireland. He was the third son of Edward Osbaldeston of Osbaldeston Hall, a member of an old and prominent Lancashire family, and Maud, daughter of Sir Thomas Halsall. The Osbaldestons were related to the Stanleys, Earls of Derby, and Edward seems to have owed his rise to their patronage. He was educated at St Mary Hall, Oxford and entered Gray's Inn in 1577, becoming Ancient of the Inn in 1593. He sat in the House of Commons of England as member for Newton in the Parliament of 1597-8. In 1601 his patroness Alice, Countess of Derby lobbied on his behalf for an official position in Ireland. In 1605 he was sent there as a justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). Unfortunately for his future career prospects the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Arthur Chichester, soon formed a very poor view of his efficiency, and within two years he was moved to the office of Chief Justice of Connacht; a step which was universally seen as a demotion for incompetence. He served on a number of Crown commissions and wrote a report on the state of Galway City in 1626. He retired in 1634; his precise date of death does not seem to be recorded. He married Lucy Warren of Poynton in Cheshire and had three children; through his daughter Deborah he was the ancestor of the prominent Lyster family of County Roscommon. Richard Osbaldeston, Attorney General for Ireland, was a cousin of Geoffrey's of the next generation."

She was born to professor Carl Jacob Rossander and Emma Maria Godenius. She graduated at the Wallinska skolan in 1887, and became Doctor of Philosophy at Uppsala University in 1901. In 1902, she married fellow student Henrik Petrini. She worked as a teacher at the secondary education school for females in Växjö in 1902-06, and as a teacher at different girl schools in Stockholm in 1914–1931. Gulli Petrini became interested in the women's movement as a student in Uppsala in the 1890s, where she frequented the radical circle around Ann-Margret Holmgren. Her interest in the women's movement was inspired by her own life, which was not conventional. Supported by her progressive father, she studied at university when this was still a controversial thing for a female; she was also a professional despite being married in a period when married females were not expected to support themselves. She became active within politics in 1904, when she became engaged in the local branch of the suffrage movement in Växjö, and soon became a prominent figure in the Swedish women suffrage movement."

From 1818 to 1821 he worked in Ulm, afterwards being based in Stuttgart, where in 1829 he became an official interpreter for Italian, Spanish and Portuguese at the Ministry of Justice and the Interior. From 1836 onward, he held the title of councilor. As a botanist, he collected specimens from southern Germany, Austria and northern Italy. In 1832, with Gustav Schübler, he conducted botanical investigations in southeastern Württemberg. His European collections subsequently became part of the \"Naturaliencabinet\" in Stuttgart. He is also known for his studies of freshwater and marine algae, especially species native to eastern Asia. In 1862 he received an honorary degree in sciences from the University of Tübingen. In 1841 the red algae genus Martensia (family Delesseriaceae) was named in his honor."

  "text" : "Guo Jian (Chinese: 郭健; pinyin: Guō Jiàn; born in Guizhou China in 1962) is a Chinese Australian artist. His work has been exhibited and collected in Germany, France, Belgium, Sweden, USA, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and China, including Musée de Picardie in France, Brussels Art Festival, the Art Gallery Of New South Wales, the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA) and the National Gallery of Australia (NGA). He has been featured in The New York Times, CNN, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), Artist Profile magazine and on the cover of The Wall Street Journal Asia Weekend Magazine. He is part of a movement of contemporary Chinese artists whose work is characterised as Cynical Realism, which began in the 1990s in Beijing. Born a year after the Great Leap Forward, his art is heavily influenced by the last fifty years of political upheaval and violence in China, a period that included the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 70s, the Sino Vietnamese war in the early 1980s, and the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. At age seventeen, he enlisted in China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) during a recruitment drive to support the Sino-Vietnamese war, initiated by the country’s then leader Deng Xiaoping. A central theme to Guo Jian’s art derives from his observations of the application of propaganda and the arts to both motivate soldiers and sway public opinion. His perspective comes from his experiences as a propaganda poster painter in the PLA and propaganda officer in a transport company, then later from the outside looking back in as a student demonstrator during the Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. His art also explores common themes and approaches in both Chinese propaganda and Western propaganda."

Georg Johan De Besche was the son of Johan Jacob De Besche and Anna Catharina Hilchen. He never married. He became page to Gustav III in 1770, chamber page in 1774, courtier in 1783 and governor of Stockholm Royal Palace in 1793–94. He had a career in the Västgöta cavalry regiment, where he became a cadet in 1765, lieutenant in 1776, major in 1787 and colonel in 1792. Georg Johan De Besche belonged to the group of male favorites of Gustav III consisting of Adolf Fredrik Munck, Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, Fabian Wrede and the brothers Evert Vilhelm Taube and Karl Edvard Taube who was referred to as pet-youths. Like several others of the King's male favorites, he himself was known for his love affairs with women; he was known for his taste for \"Vulgar girls\", and according to Princess Charlotte, he had a bad reputation and was considered to be debauched. According to Elis Schröderheim, after the parliament of 1789, when Gustav III had punished the noble opposition and as a consequence was punished by being socially ostracized from high society by a demonstration of female nobles led by Jeanna von Lantingshausen, he became completely socially dependent upon this group of favorites, with whom he isolated himself at the Gustav III's Pavilion by Haga Palace, were he engaged in ill reputed orgies with prostitutes. After the death of Gustav III, the position of the De Besche deteriorated, and in 1795 he finally lost all his remaining offices with the motivation that he was a Gustavian. In 1806, he was given the position of chamberlain at the court of Queen Dowager Sophia Magdalena who, while she disliked all the male favorites of Gustav III while he were alive, with the exception of Munck, treated them with consideration after he was dead."

Jacobs wrote a well received memoir, Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra (coauthor William Stadiem; HarperEntertainment, 2003, ISBN 978-0060515164) that chronicled his time in Sinatra's employment, from 1953 to his dismissal by Sinatra in 1968. According to his New York Times obituary, Jacobs was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, then moved to Los Angeles after serving in the U.S. Navy. He reportedly worked as a valet for Bill Cosby and Steve McQueen after Sinatra severed his longtime employment over a misunderstanding."

Georg Stenz was involved in two major incidents where force was used against Catholic missionaries in Shandong, the Juye incident and the Jietou incident. The Juye incident was an attack on Stenz's mission station in Zhang Jia Village on November 1, 1897 in which two German missionaries were killed. Stenz, who was the likely target of the attack, managed to hide and escaped unharmed. The incident was used by the German Empire to justify the occupation of Qingdao. In the Jietou incident, Stenz and a group of Chinese Christians were mistreated and held prisoner in the village of Jietou (Chinese: 街头镇; pinyin: Jiētóu zhèn, Rizhao) for three days (8–11 November 1898) resulting in German military intervention and compensation claims."

  "text" : "George Baillie (16 March 1664 – 6 August 1738) was a Scottish politician who served in the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of Great Britain. George Baillie was the son of the Scottish Covenanter Robert Baillie of Jerviswood, who was implicated in the 1683 Rye House Plot against King Charles II. When his father was imprisoned for treason in 1684, George fled Scotland for Holland with Sir Patrick Hume. In Holland he served in the horse guards of William of Orange, and returned to Britain with William in the Revolution of 1688. Baillie was elected as a Member of the Parliament of Scotland, representing Berwickshire from 1693–8 and 1700–1, and then Lanarkshire from 1703–7. He was a leading member of the Squadrone Volante, a group of members who were influential in the debates which led to the union with England in 1707. After the Union, Baillie attended the Parliament of Great Britain, representing Berwickshire for 26 years. In 1711, he was appointed Commissioner for Trade and Plantations by Queen Mary II and in 1714 King George I appointed him one of the Lords of Admiralty. In 1717 he was elevated to Lord of Treasury as a junior Lord Commissioner of the Treasury until 1725. He stepped down as an MP in 1734, and died at Oxford in 1738. He was buried on his estate of Mellerstain in Berwickshire. In 1691 he married Sir Patrick Hume's daughter, Lady Grizell Hume, and they had three children; Grisell (1692), Robert (1694) and Rachel (1696). Robert died in infancy. Rachel married Charles Hamilton, Lord Binning, son of the Earl of Haddington. Their son Thomas inherited the earldom as well as Mellerstain House, which remains the principal seat of the Earl of Haddington."

The prolific Herms has also created theater pieces, about which he has said, \"I treat it as a Joseph Cornell box big enough that you can walk around in. It's just a continuation of my sculpture, one year at a time.\" Legendary curator Walter Hopps, who met Herms in 1956, \"placed Herms on a dazzling continuum of assemblage artists that includes Pablo Picasso, Kurt Schwitters, Marcel Duchamp, and Joseph Cornell, as well as California luminaries Wallace Berman and Edward Kienholz.\" Often called a member of the West Coast Beat movement, Herms said that Wallace Berman taught him that \"any object, even a mundane cast-off, could be of great interest if contextualized properly.\" \"That’s my whole thing,\" Herms says. \"I turn shit into gold. I just really want to see something I've never seen before.\" George Herms lives and works in Los Angeles."

Rebelling against caste discrimination at an early age at a convent school and dropping himself out, he diverted his youthful energies into the formation of \"Yuvak Mandal\" in 1968 at Poinsur for providing civic necessities to the Slums like drinking water, providing electricity, Balwadis and other needs. His leadership skills were rewarded with his first electoral entry into politics in 1992 as a municipal councilor. Quickly building up, he was rewarded with the Best Corporator award and above all being the first deputy mayor in the only \"Mayor in Council\" of the city of Mumbai. His landmark contribution as deputy mayor was the first 216 crore \"Mega Micro Tunneling Water Supply Project\" from Tulsi Lake filtration plant to Goregaon; then extended up to Kandivali (West). He has also served the Bharatiya Janata Party in various capacities from mandal secretary to the president of Mumbai BJP. Representing Borivali constituency for the past 22 years that include three terms as corporator and two terms as MLA, his popularity has been growing largely due to commitment to various issues of development and his ability to find practical solutions to the grievances of the citizens via his consistent personal contact and easy accessibility with one and all.

  "text" : "George Watters II (born September 19, 1949) is an American sound editor with more than 80 feature film credits. He has won the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing twice, for The Hunt for Red October (1990) and for Pearl Harbor (2001). Watters entered the film industry in 1973 as an apprentice in the Television Sound Editing Department at Paramount Pictures. Following his apprenticeship, he became an assistant sound editor for feature films at Paramount; in a 2012 interview, he said, \"At that time I had the opportunity to work a bit in picture editing and music editing, but I found I preferred sound FX editing. Sound is sculptural, imaginative, universal and for me the most creative medium.\" Watters' first credit as a Supervising Sound Editor was for American Hot Wax (1978). Watters worked at Paramount Studios until 1992. In his interview, Watters singled out his long relationship with Jerry Bruckheimer. Bruckheimer produced twenty-five of the films for which Watters was the sound editor, from Flashdance (1983) through Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). In 2012, Watters received the Career Achievement Award of the Motion Picture Sound Editors (MPSE), which is an honorary society of sound editors based in the United States."

  "text" : "Gábor Béla Rácz (born 1937), is a board-certified anesthesiologist and professor emeritus at Texas Tech University Health Science Center (TTUHSC) in Lubbock, Texas, where he is also Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Anesthesiology and Co-Director of Pain Services. He has worked in the field of chronic back pain and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). In 1982, he designed the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter with a small fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, sometimes referred to as percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline and steroids to be injected into the affected area. Racz was born in Hungary and, as a young man, had aspirations to become a medical doctor. He was a second-year medical student in November 1956 when he was forced to flee Hungary after the Soviets invaded Budapest in response to the Hungarian Revolution. He eventually arrived in England and resumed his education. He graduated from the University of Liverpool School of Medicine, and worked in the UK until 1963 at which time he moved to the United States. He completed his anesthesiology residency at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. He also worked as an associate attending anesthesiologist and respiratory consultant for other hospitals including the Veterans Administration Hospital, and the UHS Chenango Memorial Hospital in Norwich, New York before moving to Lubbock, Texas where he became the first Chairman of Anesthesiology for the then-new Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC). Racz is also one of the founders of the World Institute of Pain."

In 1924, the Victoria and Albert Museum accepted her private collection, at this time containing over 80,000 theatrical playbills and programmes. The material became the founding collection of the museum's theatre and performance archives.Enthoven's unparalleled knowledge of the London stage and its history earned her the sobriquet 'the theatrical encyclopaedia'."

  "text" : "Gianluca Busato (born Treviso, 14 May 1969) is an Italian entrepreneur, engineer, activist and politician who is mostly known as the main organiser of the unofficial and online Venetian independence referendum, which took place in March 2014. As a university student of Engineering at the University of Padua, Busato joined Liga Veneta–Lega Nord and was elected municipal councillor in Casier. Having been expelled from that party, he was one of the founding members of the Padanian Independentist Movement in 1997 and was its spokesperson for two years. In this capacity, he was convicted for having been an outspoken supporter of Padania and of the Venetian Most Serene Government's seizure of St. Mark's Campanile in Venice. This last event led Busato to abandon his early Padanist feelings and to adhere convincingly to the Venetian independence movement. According to his own words, Busato returned to active politics only after the depenalisation of \"crimes of opinion\". In 2006 he wrote a pamphlet on independence and was a founding member of the Venetians Movement and, a year later, he launched the libertarian and avowedly separatist Venetian National Party (PNV), and served as its national secretary from 2008 to 2010. He was later active, often taking leadership roles, in a succession of separatist outfits, all emerged from bulk of the PNV: Veneto State (2010–2012), Venetian Independence (2012–2013), Plebiscite 2013 (2013–2014) and, finally, Veneto Yes (since 2013). In 2014 Busato came to regional prominence as the main organiser of Plebiscito.eu, an online referendum on Veneto's independence. According to the staff, 2.36 million Venetians (63.2% of all eligible voters) participated in the online referendum and 89.1% of them (that is to say 56.6% of all eligible voters) voted yes. This was enough for Busato and his followers to proclaim Veneto's independence from Italy in Treviso on the night of 21 March. In the poll, ten \"delegates for independence\" were elected too: Busato was the most voted candidate with 135,306 preference votes."

After following secondary education and classes préparatoires scientifiques in the parisian Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Skandalis studied from 1975 at 1979 at l’École Normale Supérieure de la rue d’Ulm with agrégation in 1977. From 1979 he was an assistant at the University of Paris VI, where under Alain Connes in 1986 he earned his doctorate (doctorat d´État). From 1980 to 1988 he was attaché de recherches and then chargé de recherches at CNRS and as of 1988 Professor at the University of Paris VII (in the Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu). He works on operator algebras, K-theory of operator algebras, groupoids, locally compact quantum groups and singular foliations. In 2002 with Nigel Higson and Vincent Lafforgue, Skandalis published counterexamples to a generalization of the Baum–Connes conjecture (i.e. Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients) in various special cases, based on work by Mikhail Gromov. In 1990 Skandalis was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto (Operator Algebras and Duality). He was a member of Bourbaki."

  "text" : "Lieutenant-Colonel George Robert Harland Bowden (1873 – 10 October 1927) was a British mechanical engineer and Conservative Party politician. Born in Durham, at the age of 15 he was apprenticed to Lambton Collieries whilst attending classes at Durham College of Science. In 1890 he moved to South Wales as improver for the ironworks at Tondu. In 1891 he became assistant engineer and chief draughtsman at Cyfarthfa Ironworks, Merthyr Tydfil. He returned to North East England in 1896 as manager of D Selby Bigge and Company, an engineering company based in Newcastle. In 1902 he founded his own company, G Harland Bowden and Company, consulting engineers of Victoria Street, London. The firm specialised in the design and installation of colliery and factory plants. In 1908 he became a Member of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. In 1907 Bowden was granted a Volunteer Force commission in the Royal Garrison Artillery. Bowden was active in Conservative Party politics, and in April 1912 was adopted as the party's prospective candidate for the parliamentary constituency of North East Derbyshire. In April 1914 the sitting Labour Party member of parliament for North East Derbyshire died, causing a by-election. The by-election was held on 20 May, and Bowden was elected to the Commons, gaining the seat for the Conservatives with a majority of 314 votes. During World War I Bowden became commanding officer of 17th (Empire) Battalion, the Royal Fusiliers, a war-formed unit. He continued to hold his parliamentary seat during the war, but found himself estranged from the Conservative Party, going so far as to issue libel proceedings against a party official. At the 1918 general election he defended his seat as an Independent Conservative, opposed by a Conservative candidate who had the support of the Coalition Government. He lost his seat to the Liberal candidate, finishing in third place. In October 1919 he was awarded 125 pounds in damages for libel against the vice-chairman of the North East Derbyshire Unionist Association. By the time of the 1924 general election Bowden had repaired his ties to the Conservatives, and stood as the party's candidate in North East Derbyshire once more. He was unsuccessful, with the Labour Party holding the seat. He died suddenly at his home, \"Rodney\", Belmont Hill, St Albans in October 1927, aged 64."

  "text" : "Sir Graham Stanley Latimer KBE (7 February 1926 – 7 June 2016) was a New Zealand Māori leader, chosen in the late 1960s to be a new leader to resolve Māori grievances. He was a member of the New Zealand Māori Council from 1964, and president from 1973. In 1987 he initiated a successful appeal against the State-Owned Enterprises Act leading to actions against the Crown relating to land, forests, fisheries and te reo Māori (mortgaging his farm at Taipuha for the expenses). He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1980 Queen's Birthday Honours. He was born on the Aupouri Peninsula south of Te Kao in Northland, then a depressed area. His mother Lillian was Irish-Scottish and his father Graham of mixed Anglo-Saxon and Māori ancestry. As well as being a Pākehā–Māori marriage, the bride was Catholic and the groom Anglican, so the couple married in the local police station. The family lived at Pamapuria seven kilometres from Kaitaia. He attended three primary schools, and then went to Kaitaia District High School. He left after two weeks, as he was needed to help hand-milk the small family herd of 14 dairy cows on 48 acres. When the herd was sold because of whānau disputes, he worked on other farms. He enlisted in the Army in 1943, and went to Japan in 1946–47 in Jayforce as part of the army of occupation. In 1948 he married Emily Moore, and worked for the New Zealand Railways until 1961, becoming stationmaster at Kaiwaka in 1952. From 1961 he was a farmer on the Kaipara Harbour; to 1979 at Tinopai and from 1979 to 1995 at Taipuha. In 1995 he returned to Pamapuria. He was made a spokesman for Ngāti Whātua (though his own hapū is Ngāti Kahu from the Aupouri Peninsula) and a Māori warden in 1956. In 1963 he was elected to the Tai Tokerau District Māori Council in 1963 and one of three members representing te Tai Tokerau on the New Zealand Māori Council 1964. On the New Zealand Māori Council he was vice-president 1969 and president from 1973. In 1977 he was appointed one of the first three members of the Waitangi Tribunal. He was chairman of the Crown Forest Rental Trust from 1990, and a member of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission between 1993 and 1998. He retrieved tūpuna Māori from an English auction house in 1988, and stopped the public sale of human remains. He was active in other organisations, the Anglican General Synod, on the board of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, a member of the Alcoholic Liquor Advisory Council and was a director of several commercial enterprises. He was a member of the National Party, and was Māori vice-president from 1981 to 1992. He stood in the Northern Maori electorate in 1969 and 1972, coming second for National both times."

  "text" : "George Wayne Decker (November 6, 1938 – April 4, 2014) was a classical musician. He was born at Pittsgrove, New Jersey to Vincent W. Decker and Nina May (Garrison) Decker. As an adult, he worked and lived in Syracuse, New York. Decker graduated from Rider University's Westminster Choir College, and continued his studies at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Later, he studied with Marie-Madeleine Chevalier-Duruflé in Paris. He worked for three years as assistant organist to William Self at St. Thomas Church in New York City, before accepting the Organist and Choir Director positions at St. Paul's Church in Syracuse, New York, in 1967. A few years later, the church became St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral. Decker performed all of Bach's organ works in a series of afternoon recitals, and directed all of Bach's cantatas at St Paul's Cathedral. He premiered several works in Syracuse with the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra including Poulenc's Concerto for Organ, Strings and Timpani in G minor and Handel's Organ Concerto in F major \"The Cuckoo and the Nightingale\". He was called upon to perform a solo recital at Notre-Dame, Paris in which he performed notable American composers for the organ and Maurice Duruflé's Prélude, Adagio et Choral varié sur le thème du 'Veni Creator'. Decker made the recording My Favorite Hymns with Leontyne Price. This recording is still in print."
