Lanning has played a major role in persuading trade unions in Britain to declare solidarity with the Palestinians and to support the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) movement. During his tenure at PCS, Lanning was active in the effort to keep people he considered 'fascists' or 'racists' out of the union and out of union workplaces. Lanning has given speeches at many labour and anti-racism rallies and has been a frequent contributor to the Morning Star, the daily newspaper of the Communist Party of Britain."

He led a campaign to rename his home village as \"Deiniolen\", which was successful. Always a strong proponent of home rule for Wales, in 1924 he founded the Welsh Home Rule Army and, as one of its three most prominent leaders, he attended the founding meeting of Plaid Cymru. Plaid was founded in a hotel in Pwllheli, while the National Eisteddfod was underway. Jones was chosen as its first general secretary, but the other party founders convinced him to avoid non-violent direct action in their cause. In 1928, he stood for election to the county council in Upper Deiniolen, the party's only candidate, but he was not elected. Although popular with party members, he was not regarded as an effective organiser. He contracted tuberculosis and in 1928, he became aware that he did not have long to live. He was compelled to scale back his role until his death in 1930. After Jones' death, Gwenallt composed \"Breudduyd y Bardd\" in his honour."

  "text" : "Hugo Merton (18 November 1879, Frankfurt am Main – 23 March 1940, Edinburgh) was a German zoologist. He studied sciences at the University of Heidelberg. From October 1907 to August 1908, with herpetologist Jean Roux, he conducted scientific investigations in the Aru and Kei Islands. In 1913 he obtained his habilitation at Heidelberg with a dissertation on the flatworm genus Temnocephala. Because of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws imposed by the Nazis, he was forced to relinquish his position as deputy director at the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt as well as his professorship at the University of Heidelberg. In 1937, by way of an invitation from Professor F. A. E. Crew, he went to the University of Edinburgh, where he spent time working in the institute of animal genetics. Upon this return to Germany in 1938, he was arrested and imprisoned in the concentration camp at Dachau. During the following year, he was deported to Scotland, where he resumed his work at the university. Due to deteriorated health, he died soon afterwards in March 1940. Organisms with the specific epithet of mertoni are named in his honor, an example being the sea snake species Parahydrophis mertoni. In 1911, Max Carl Wilhelm Weber named the fish species Pseudomugil gertrudae after Merton's wife, Gertrude."

  "text" : "Henry Butler (16 or 17 November 1821 – 22 August 1885), was a surgeon and politician in colonial Tasmania. Butler was the third son of Gamaliel Butler, solicitor, and was born in Cornhill, London, England. In 1823 the family emigrated to Van Diemen's Land (later renamed Tasmania). Butler was educated in England, and chose medicine as his profession, becoming a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1843, and in 1849 a fellow of that college. After studying at some of the hospitals on the Continent, he returned to Tasmania, and began the practice of his profession in Hobart. Butler contested the seat of Brighton in the old unicameral Tasmanian Legislative Council without success in 1851, however he was elected in 1854. On the introduction of free institutions in September 1856 he entered the new Tasmanian House of Assembly (lower house) as member for Brighton, holding the seat, apart from the period from November 1862 to October 1866, until his death. In August 1869 Butler became a member of the James Wilson Ministry without portfolio. In the following October he was appointed Minister of Lands and Works, a position which he held till November 1872, when he resigned with his colleagues. He succeeded Sir Robert Officer as Speaker of the Tasmanian House of Assembly in April 1877, and having been twice re-elected in the interval, resigned in July 1885. Dr. Butler took a prominent part in educational matters. In 1853 he was appointed a member of the Central Board of Education for the colony. In 1856, when two boards were appointed, he became Chairman of the Southern Board. In 1863, shortly after the amalgamation of the two boards, he was appointed Chairman of the Central Board in succession to William Nairn. Butler had the role of Surveyor General of Tasmania (as Minister of Lands) from 1869 to 1872. As chairman he administered the educational system of the colony with ability and success until the abolition of the Board of Education in 1884 and the transference of the control of the education department to a Minister directly responsible to Parliament. Dr. Butler married Catherine Smith, daughter of Thomas Smith, of Glen Rock, Sydney. He died at Hobart on 22 August 1885."

His tenure coincided with the Six Day War and the severing of diplomatic ties with the United States. He later became notorious for the \"Smythe Telegram\" that he wrote during the increasing tensions before the war, where he demanded that the U.S. return to a pro-Arab foreign policy and said that the U.S. should ignore previous promises to Israel that Egypt would not be allowed to ban Israeli ships from transiting the Straits of Tiran. He left the country on June 8, 1967."

  "text" : "Hermann Ebert (20 June 1861 in Leipzig – 12 February 1913 in Munich) was a German physicist. From 1881 he studied astronomy and physics in Leipzig, where he was a student of Heinrich Bruns and Gustav Wiedemann. After graduation, he relocated to the University of Erlangen as an assistant to Eilhard Wiedemann, the son of his former instructor. In 1894 he was chosen as an associate professor of theoretical physics in Leipzig, and later the same year, he became a professor of experimental physics at the University of Kiel. From 1898 onward, he was a professor of experimental physics at the Technical University in Munich. His earlier scientific work dealt largely with subjects such as spectroscopy and electric discharges in gases. While at Munich, he conducted important, pioneer research of atmospheric electricity. His other scientific interests included solar physics, zodiacal light, lunar craters, atmospheric optics and the Earth's magnetic field. His name is associated with the \"Ebert-Fastie spectrometer\", an optical device built by William George Fastie of Johns Hopkins University based on Ebert's design of a monochromator in 1889."

Together with a colleague, Karafin was one of three finalists for the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for Local Investigative Specialized Reporting. He was dismissed in 1967 after a Philadelphia magazine article exposed his willingness to accept payment from potential reporting subjects in order to avoid negative coverage. Karafin was convicted on 40 counts of blackmail and corrupt solicitation in 1968 and sentenced to 4-to-9 years; he was additionally convicted of perjury in 1971 in relation to statements in the 1968 trial, with a concurrent 2- to 7-year sentence.

  "text" : "Huang Jiguang (Chinese: 黄继光; pinyin: Huáng Jìguāng; January 18, 1931 – October 19, 1952) was a highly decorated Chinese soldier during the Korean War. Huang was originally from the Sichuan Province. In March 1951, Huang decided to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to fight against the American-led United Nations forces in the Korean War. After joining the war, Huang became a runner and was later awarded the Meritorious Service, Third Class for his bravery. At the Battle of Triangle Hill in October 1952, Huang's unit was tasked with destroying an enemy blockhouse. According to official accounts, Huang hurled himself against a machine gun slit on the blockhouse after running out of ammunition, blocking enemy fire while sacrificing his life. As a result of his heroism, the Chinese forces overran the position while annihilating a significant amount of enemy soldiers. In one version of the story, it was also claimed that Huang's final action was specifically inspired by the Soviet war film Private Alexander Matrosov, which was in turn based on the real life exploit of Alexander Matrosov during the Great Patriotic War. Huang was posthumously given the title of \"Combat Hero, Second Class\", which was later upgraded to \"Combat Hero, Special Class\". The North Korean government also awarded Huang with the title of \"Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\", a Gold Star Medal and the Medal of the National Flag, First-Class."

She was the National Party spokesperson for Health, Community Services and Women's Interests from March 1989 until November 1992, and the Coalition Shadow Minister for Family and Youth from November 1992 to February 1993 after the National Party re-entered their coalition with the Liberal Party. She was not appointed to the ministry after the election of the Court Coalition government at the 1993 state election. Turnbull served on the Library Committee (1993-1998), as chairman of the Select Committee on Intervention in Childbirth (1994-1995), and as a member of the Select Committee on the National HIV/AIDS Strategy White Paper (1989-1990), the Select Committee on Country Hospitals and Nursing Posts (1990-1992), the Select Committee on Science and Technology (1993-1994), and the Select Committee on Heavy Transport (1994-1996).

Prior to producing the Atlas Shrugged movies, Kaslow was an executive at A-Mark Entertainment and Kismet Entertainment Group and an associate at Shea & Gould, an international law firm. Kaslow is a finance / corporate / entertainment lawyer. He has provided production, distribution and finance legal counsel and has been an \"executive producer\" on more than 15 motion pictures including the cult-classic Dog Soldiers, but Atlas Shrugged: Part I was the first time he received credit as a \"Producer\" (along with Aglialoro) on a motion picture. As a result of a WGA Arbitration over the writing credits, Kaslow, along with J. James Manera & John Aglialoro, received a \"screenplay by\" credit on Atlas Shrugged III: Who is John Galt? In a 2011 interview promoting the motion picture \"Atlas Shrugged - Part I\", Kaslow stated the following: \"I believe in limited government, I believe in individual liberty, and I think that those are very similar to the same core values that the party espouses for its members.\". In 2013, Kaslow was part of a Kickstarter campaign that was launched to promote and market Atlas Shrugged: Who is John Galt?, and the Kickstarter campaign was successful in that it raised more than $445,000 which was nearly $200,000 more than the campaign's goal. An unfinished edit of Atlas Shrugged: Who is John Galt? premiered at the Anthem Film Festival and was awarded 2014 Best Narrative Film. The movie was released theatrically on September 12, 2014. The Atlas Shrugged trilogy was not well received by the critics despite nearly $9M of USA box office. In 2015, Kaslow made an announcement regarding CinemaCloudWorks, which was hailed as a revolutionary technology for planning, booking, settling and marketing theatrical motion pictures Kaslow attended high school in Santa Ynez, California. In 1979, the year he graduated, he was also elected the State President of the California Future Farmers of America (FFA)  and was part of a contingent of FFA Leaders who met with President Carter. Kaslow received a BS in Agricultural and Managerial Economics at the University of California, Davis and a law degree from the University of Southern California."

In 1924, following Anrep's advice, Liddell went on to set up a laboratory modelled on that of Pavlov. He experimented on pigs, dogs, sheep, goats, and rabbits.

She moved to Chicago ca. 1924, where she worked in local clubs and theatres until the early 1930s. In 1925 she recorded for Gennett Records, and in 1925–26 she recorded several sides for the Okeh label. Her accompanists on the Okeh recordings included Louis Armstrong and her teenaged uncle Hersal Thomas, whose piano is heard on \"Fish Tail Dance\" and four other sides. During the years of the Great Depression her career diminished, and she worked outside the field of music. In the early 1940s she moved to Oakland, California. In 1946 she recorded seven songs with Mutt Carey for the Circle label, which were her last recordings. She worked with Kid Ory's Orchestra in San Francisco In 1948. In 1948 or 1949, she engaged in a brawl with one of her sisters in which she lost her eyesight and her sister was killed. Charged with manslaughter, she was tried and acquitted.

Rowe and Warren Sadler started a business in Baltimore publishing a practical accounting text in workbook format. The Sadler-Rowe Company was under Rowe's control in 1907, and renamed to the H.M. Rowe Company in 1911. Rowe operated the De Kol Farm dairy outside of Baltimore. He also owned a large frame house on Johnnycake Road in Catonsville, that burned down on 23 March 1912, but was well insured. Shortly afterward in 1913, Rowe constructed a $20,000 mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery. Rowe was an executive of the American Automobile Association, becoming its president from 1916-1918 promoting road construction to Congress. Rowe partnered with A.T. Carozza on lucrative road building and public works contracts in Maryland, forming Carozza-Rowe Construction. In 1926, Carozza mortgaged his Ingleside estate to Rowe and again to Addison E. Mullikin. The same year, Rowe's son killed his father with a crowbar, stabbed his sister, pushed his mother into a fire, and was found dead in the Severn River soon afterward."

  "text" : "Henry Dowling (1810 – 17 September 1885) was a newspaper editor and politician in colonial Tasmania. Dowling was born in Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England, son of Henry Dowling, a Baptist minister.Dowling junior was educated at the Free Grammar School, Colchester, and was afterwards apprenticed to the printing business. In 1830 he emigrated to Van Diemen's Land (later renamed to Tasmania), and was for some time on the staff of the Hobart Town Courier, but in the following year he purchased from John Pascoe Fawkner the Launceston Independent, and changing its name to the Launceston Advertiser, conducted it for some years with much success. In 1839 Dowling proceeded to England, having received the appointment of Immigration Agent for Tasmania, in which capacity he was the means of introducing into the colony many settlers whose names were well known in Northern Tasmania. In 1842 he returned to Launceston, Tasmania, and was for some years engaged in the printing and drapery business. He was one of the founders of the Launceston Savings Bank, and in 1844 was appointed manager of that institution. Dowling was always active in public affairs, and was specially prominent in the anti-transportation movement, and in the agitation for railways. Dowling was Mayor of Launceston from 1857 to 1861, and in the latter year was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly as member for Launceston, but only held the seat for two years. In 1868 he accepted the secretaryship of the Launceston and Western Railway Company, and held that position until the year 1872, when this, the first of Tasmanian railways, was taken over by the Government. Amongst the works issued from Dowling's press may be mentioned an illustrated edition of the Pickwick Papers and West's History of Tasmania.Dowling died on 17 September 1885 in Launceston, Tasmania."

  "text" : "Hans Rev (or Hans Reff, about 1489 in Denmark – July/August 1545 in Oslo) was a Norwegian clergyman. He was the last Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo before the Protestant Reformation, and later became the first Lutheran Superintendent of the Diocese of Oslo within the Church of Norway. About Rev's background, little is known except that he was of Danish origin. He studied in Paris, where he earned his Master's Degree in both Roman and Canon Law. He worked for some years as secretary for Erik Valkendorf, who was elected Archbishop of Nidaros in 1510. In 1525, Rev has been appointed Bishop of Oslo with the support of Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson and King Frederick I of Denmark. In August 1536, along with the other Roman Catholic bishops of Denmark and Norway, he was declared deposed by King Christian III of Denmark. In November 1537, Rev renounced his episcopal dignity in a letter to the King and promised his continued loyalty and allegiance.

He undertook numerous scientific trips throughout Eastern Europe and North Africa. In 1927, he spent 28 weeks on an excursion to the lower Amazon region. From his expeditions, a number of new entomological species have been identified. Also, he is credited with conducting significant research involving South East Asian Noctuidae and members of Neotropical Syntomidae. He was associated with several learned organizations, being a member of the Zoologisch-Botanischen Gesellschaft in Wien and an honorary member of the Wiener Entomologischen Gesellschaft."

  "text" : "Herman Charles Koenig (November 28, 1893 – July 6, 1959) was an avid collector of first editions and fantasy literature and a friend of the fantasy writer H. P. Lovecraft (1890–1937), and a member of his literary circle, the Kalem Club (the last names of the early members started with the letters K, L or M). Koenig was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, the last child in the family of Herman Koenig (listed as “Henry König” in the 1870 United States Census) and Anna Poggenburg, German immigrants. He graduated magna cum laude from Cooper Union, and worked as the laboratory manager at Electrical Testing Laboratories in New York City. A lifelong fan of fantasy fiction, he contributed articles to early fanzines in this field, and published his own fanzine The Reader and Collector, printing twenty issues from 1938 to 1946. He collaborated with the writer August Derleth (1909–1971), one of Lovecraft’s many correspondents, who founded the publishing company Arkham House to print Lovecraft’s work after his death. Koenig was one of the few people who printed some of Lovecraft’s writings during the latter’s lifetime. Based on a long letter Lovecraft had written to Koenig in 1936, he privately printed in mimeograph form the essay Charleston. It included photo copies of Lovecraft’s sketches of architectural highlights of that South Carolina city. Koenig is also acknowledged for his efforts in fostering in the United States the writings of British author William Hope Hodgson (1877–1918), circulating copies of Hodgson’s books to Lovecraft and others. When Arkham House reprinted four of Hodgson’s novels (The House on the Borderland and Other Novels) in 1946, Derleth asked Koenig to write the introduction."

His grandfather was Hans Christensen, also a farmer and politician. Nielsen received his education in a private school, followed by a year in 1869–1870 at Vejstrup College and then Gedved Seminarium. His studies were interrupted by military service at Odense. In 1878 he married Gunhild Knudsen, daughter of jeweler Knudsen from Copenhagen, and between 1878 and 1885 they lived on a farm in Vejstrup. In December 1882 he became politically active with the Oure-Vejstrup Parish, of which he was a member for six years, the last three years as chairman. In 1892 he was elected to the Svendborg County Council as his father's successor. In 1884, he became member of the Committee for Svendborg Nyborg railways, and later promoted to director and in 1903 to Executive Chairman. In 1897, he also became a member of the Executive Board of the Fyns Telefon Company at the request of Frederik Hey, who believed that the company should be owned by the county and urban municipalities. The same year, he succeeded his father as director of the Agricultural Bank of Fyn. In 1884, Nielsen also became part of financial division of Svendborg County, but had to abandon this post three years later due to political tensions. On 1 January 1890 Nielsen co-founded a magazine of Svendborg County, Folkebladet for Svendborg Amt, which was a medium of moderate-left politics. In 1900 he was hired as director of fire insurance in Svendborg and held this post until his death in 1928. On 28 August 1908 he became Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog."

He was wounded at Petersburg, Virginia and was discharged in January 1865 as captain of Company F. With two partners, O'Lone came to Portage la Prairie later that year. He moved to Winnipeg after one of his partners was killed in a fight. O'Lone was later killed by a blow to the head with a revolver. It is believed that he was one of several persons killed by Canadian troops in retaliation for the execution of Thomas Scott."

  "text" : "Harry Edward Cross (September 9, 1881 – April 3, 1946) was an American sports writer and editor. Cross was regarded as one of the most accomplished sports journalist in New York City for more than three decades. He was a specialized expert in writing about baseball, boxing and football, and was also an authority in lesser known sports as curling, figure skating, polo and rowing. Excepting golf and tennis, he was assigned to cover almost every major event, becoming a familiar figure at the Polo Grounds, Yankee Stadium and Madison Square Garden, as well as at other sports venues. Born in New Britain, Connecticut, Cross grew up in nearby Naugatuck. A distinguished alumnus of Naugatuck High School, he then graduated from Harvard College in 1905. He started his sports writing career with the Waterbury American that autumn and for the next four years. Cross joined the sports department of The New York Times in 1909, where he remained through 1920. Soon after his arriving in New York, he covered primarily the New York Giants Major League Baseball club, to become one of the first Times writers to regularly attend spring training camp, while handling such major assignments as the historic and controversial Jack Dempsey–Jess Willard Fight of 1919. Cross became sports editor of the Evening Post in 1920, but returned to the Times from 1924 through 1926. He then joined the sports staff of the New York Herald Tribune Sunday Magazine in 1926, where he remained until 1945. He was briefly the sports editor at the Tribune in 1927, and exclusively covered baseball from 1942 to 1945. In between, Cross was president of the New York Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, being a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame committee from June 1945 until his death in 1946. In addition, he was a long-time member of the Football Writers Association, serving also as its treasurer. A few months after his death, Harry Cross was one of 12 writers who were honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame on a Roll of Honor in its Class of 1946."

They live along the Coleen River, just south of the Brooks Range, and move between cabins seasonally. Striving to be self-reliant, they hunt and fish for their own food. The Korths' lifestyle came to public attention with James Campbell's 2004 book The Final Frontiersman: Heimo Korth and His Family, Alone in Alaska's Arctic Wilderness. In 2009, VBS.tv produced Surviving Alone in Alaska, a documentary film showing Korth's lifestyle.He was also featured among others on PBS's \"Braving Alaska\" in 1992. Reliant on bush pilots to transport him in and out of his home in the bush, he was incidentally featured in Flying Wild Alaska, as Korth had hired the series' protagonist Jim Tweto to fly him out of Fairbanks. We can now follow Heimo, Edna and their family alongside 4 other families on the Discovery series The Last Alaskans."

  "text" : "Henry Jordan (19 November 1818 – 30 June 1890) was a dentist and member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, Secretary for Public Lands 1887 to 1888. Jordan was born in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England, the son of John Jordan, a Wesleyan minister from Devonshire stock, and his wife Elizabeth, née Jefferies. Jordan was educated by his father, entered Kingsford College, Bristol, and then studied at London Institution for Diseases of the Teeth. Jordan built up a lucrative dental practice in Derby. He published Practical observations on the Teeth (London, 1851) which ran to two editions and was highly praised in England and America; it later won him election to the Odontological Society of Great Britain. In February 1856 Jordan arrived in Queensland and in 1859 he married Sarah Elizabeth Hopkins Turner. Jordan was a member of the first Board of Education in Queensland, and represented the Town of Brisbane in the first session of the first Parliament. From January 1861 to December 1866 he was in London as Commissioner and Agent-General for Immigration, and from 23 December 1868 to 20 October 1871 he sat in the Assembly as member for East Moreton. In 1875 he was appointed Registrar-General, which office he held until 1883. He was elected to the Assembly for South Brisbane on 21 August 1883. In August 1887 he succeeded Charles Dutton as Secretary for Public Lands, and went out of office with his colleagues in June 1888. At the general election on 12 May 1888 he was re-elected for South Brisbane. Jordan died on 30 June 1890 at his home, Sherwood, survived by his wife, four sons and three daughters (four other children predeceased him). Jordan was buried in the Sherwood Anglican Churchyard in Brisbane. A park along the Logan River in Waterford West, Logan City is named after Jordan. His daughter, May Jordan McConnel, was a notable trade unionist and suffragist."

  "text" : "Henry Michell Wagner (1792–1870) was a Church of England clergyman who was Vicar of Brighton between 1824 and 1870. He was a descendant of Melchior Wagner, hatmaker to the Royal Family, and married into a wealthy Sussex family who had a longstanding ecclesiastical connection with Brighton. Wagner paid for and oversaw the building of five churches in the rapidly growing seaside resort, and \"dominated religious life in the town\" with his forceful personality and sometimes controversial views and actions. His son Arthur Wagner (1824–1902) continued the family's close association with Brighton. Wagner tutored the Duke of Wellington's sons for several years, and the Duke was responsible for appointing Wagner to the position of Vicar of Brighton—a role fulfilled by his grandfather Henry Michell in the 18th century. \"This appointment was to have very considerable implications for the Anglican Church in Brighton\" for the next century, as Wagner (and, later, his son) built new churches, founded and endowed charitable causes, imposed their strong characters on the town and became embroiled in regular disputes and controversies. The \"Purchas affair\", involving one of Wagner's curates and a proprietary chapel, was \"the most extraordinary event\" in Brighton's Victorian-era religious history and was reported nationally."

The back injury stalled his career and it was not until 1985 that he got an opportunity in the seniors, called up for Sydney's round three fixture against Fitzroy at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He took four marks and had six disposals, in a 51-point loss. It would be his only league appearance. An ankle injury, which required a reconstruction, made Kotzur retire.

Ajango was born in Võru, Estonia and fled with his family in 1944 to Germany when the Russian Army and Communists occupied Estonia. In 1949, the family immigrated to the United States. Ajango graduated from Wittenberg University ('1953) after studying art and mathematics and from University of Illinois ('1958) with an architectural degree. He served in the U.S. Army including as a meteorologist for artillery during the Korean War. When he returned home he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He established his architectural firm in Fort Atkinson in 1962. He studied architecture in Europe for six months on a Plym Fellowship from the University of Illinois in 1966. Ajango won the Milwaukee Inner City North Avenue Redevelopment Project Architectural Competition, in 1999 to redesign the buildings on one side of a city block.

  "text" : "Helena Johansson is a Swedish singer-songwriter Helena was born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden. She started singing at a very early age and in her teens also began writing her own music. After graduating from Kulturama in Stockholm (the leading school of performing arts in Scandinavia) she started performing her original music at clubs and other venues in Stockholm. In 2006, Helena moved to Nashville Tennessee to pursue a career in music. She wanted to develop her songwriting skills among the best songwriters in the world. In Nashville she met Swede Dan Ekbäck who was employed by the publishing company Bluewater Music at the time. Ekbäck has worked with artists such as Jill Johnson and Garth Brooks. After hearing Helena's demo he started introducing her to some of Nashville's most successful songwriters such as Liz Rose (Taylor Swift, LeeAnn Rimes, Jewel). American R&B, pop, soul, house singer/songwriter Martha Wash heard Helena's song \"It's My Time\"  and decided to record and release it as her second single on her album Something Good (January 2013). In late 2010 Helena met British producer and songwriter Denis Ingoldsby (Delilah, Flux Pavilion, Dr P). They started writing songs over Skype and after many sessions she decided to move back to Europe in order to continue their collaboration. Ingoldsby's background within electronic pop influenced Helena to incorporate that sound into her own music. In May 2013 Helena released her first single \"Lead The Way\" from her up-coming and debut EP. Her second single \"My Kind of Love\", released in July, was voted \"Pick of the Week\" on Swedish National Radio Station P4 in October 2013. Helena's EP From The Ground Up was released February 6, 2014."

His elder brother, Guy, was the heir to the viscountcy by marriage to Emma, daughter of Gerald's predecessor, Ademar. Another brother was Geoffrey I, abbot of Saint-Martial de Limoges from 991 to 998. Hildegar was the \"product of a family-run church\". Hildegar may have been chosen as bishop by Duke William IV of Aquitaine, but details of his election are not preserved. In the late spring of 977, Hildegar exempted the monastery of Uzerche from lay oversight. In 989, Hildegar attended the epochal Council of Charroux, where the \"pax Dei\" was first proclaimed. In 990, Hildegar brought some of the treasures of Saint-Martial to Paris. He fell ill and died on the journey, leaving the treasure to the abbey of Saint-Denis. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Hilduin."

He was educated in Lucerne, he studied in Neuchatel and was educated as a singer in Frankfurt am Main and Munich. He worked as an actor at the court of Altenburg, but returned to Switzerland in the First World War. He was active collecting traditional folk songs and instrumental music in all parts of Switzerland in the interbellum period. His pseudonym suggests a native of Uri, the surname being taken from the name of a character in a novel by Ernst Zahn, Albin Indergand. He used this name in order to more easily gain the confidence of his rural informants from whom he collected the songs. He used to perform the songs he collected, accompanying himself on the lute. During both world wars he was employed as a singer in the Swiss Army."

  "text" : "Hermann Friedrich Freiherr von Maltzan (18 December 1843, Rostock – 19 February 1891, Berlin) was a German malacologist known for his work in the field of conchology. A former law student at the University of Rostock, in 1864–65 he undertook an extended scientific journey to France, Spain, Italy and Egypt; a trip in which he collected numerous zoological specimens and expanded his malacological knowledge. In 1879, he traveled to Portugal, where he conducted extensive zoological research in the Algarve region. Afterwards, he continued his research in western Africa (especially French Senegambia), followed by travels to Greece, Crete and Asia Minor. After his return to Germany, he took up residence in Darmstadt and later Berlin (since 1885). In 1866 he founded the Maltzan`sches Naturhistorisches Museums für Mecklenburg (\"Maltzaneum\"), a natural history museum that the present-day \"Müritzeum\", located near the city of Waren, traces its origins to. He was the binomial author of numerous malacological species, including several within the land snail genus, Xerocrassa."

About 1858 he entered into partnership with a Bristol-born architect, John Mechelen Rogers (c1831-1889), who afterwards moved to London. The partnership ended about 1866 and Kennedy then entered into a new one with Gustavus O’Donoghue of Glasgow, also of London, which ended in 1871. After that Kennedy worked alone until shortly before his death. Most of his work was for the Diocese of Bangor, where he dominated church architecture for over fifty years, leaving his mark on most of the churches in the area. During his career he had been involved in some 80 applications to the Incorporated Church Building Society for grants to carry out work in the Bangor diocese. His two partners played little part in his Welsh projects. Henry Kennedy died in 1898. He had married Emily Du Pre, the third daughter of Rev Thomas Du Pre, Rector of Willoughby, Lincolnshire. They had two children, Emily and Henry Du Pre Kennedy."

  "text" : "Henrietta Barclay Paist (1870–1930) was an American artist, designer, teacher, and author. She is perhaps best known for her china painting, a popular turn-of-the-century pastime. Born in Red Wing, Minnesota in 1870, she studied ceramics in Germany, watercolor painting in Minneapolis, and design in Chicago before settling in the Twin Cities, where she also found time to marry and raise a family. Internationally recognized, Paist won the gold medal in 1896 at Chicago's National Exhibition of Ceramic Workers for a collection of painted porcelain and garnered an award for a portrait on porcelain at the 1900 Paris Exposition. Over her long career, she exhibited work in the Twin Cities, Chicago, New York, and Detroit. Her nineteenth-century pieces, typical of the popular Realistic style, focused on flora and fauna, while her twentieth-century work rendered many of the same subjects in the more stylized manner of the Arts and Crafts movement. The busy artist also taught at the St. Paul Institute of Arts and Sciences (forerunner of the Science Museum of Minnesota), published watercolor studies and designs for pitchers, vases, and plate borders, and served as a porcelain judge at the Minnesota State Fair for more than twenty years. A member of the Twin City Keramic Club, she was also a frequent contributor and assistant editor of the national magazine for china painters, Keramic Studio. Paist died on February 11, 1930, in Ramsey County."

  "text" : "Hugh Collins Rice has won significant prizes for his compositions, which combine lyricism with a technique influenced by medieval and renaissance procedures. His music is well suited to mixed programming and often involves abstract references to musics of the past. Hugh Collins Rice was born in Oxford in 1962. Much of his early musical experience was gained in brass bands, including five years playing with the National Youth Brass Band of Great Britain. He read music at the university of Oxford followed by an MA (composition and analysis) at Sussex and research at Oxford (M.Litt - Schoenberg's serial music). He has been teaching undergraduates at Oxford for a number of years and is currently college lecturer in music at Oriel College, Oxford. His music has been performed at many venues across the British Isles and in Europe, including the Royal Festival Hall, the Concertgebouw and the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival. Performers have included the Hilliard Ensemble, the Britten Sinfonia, Jane Manning, the Swingle Singers, the Coull Quartet and the Holywell Ensemble. Several works have been broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and in Europe. Vocal works have set a wide variety of texts from medieval graffiti to St Mark's Gospel and the poems of Geoffrey Hill, Christina Rossetti and Thomas Wyatt. Instrumental music includes the prize winning orchestral pieces Before the End (1989 PA Composition Award) and Robin's Lament (Composers' Guild/MCPS Prize, 1995); the string quartet, I Fiori, was written in association with the Walton Trust and dedicated to Lady Walton after the early stages of its composition were conceived in the spectacular gardens of La Mortella, Walton's home on the island. Writing for more unusual ensembles has been a regular feature of his output, recent examples include Earth and Moon written for the tuba quartet Tubalate, and Sequentiae Hildegargenses for the medieval ensemble Mediva. He is currently working on a music theatre project in collaboration with Mediva."

Following the publication of his first novel, Odditorium, Broun required a spinal surgery to remove a tumor that ultimately saved his life but resulted in his paralysis. Subsequently, he wrote two books by blowing air through a tube that activated the specially outfitted keyboard of a computer. Using this technology, he completed a second novel, Inner Tube, and wrote the short stories contained in a posthumously published collection entitled Cardinal Numbers. He was working on a third novel when he died of asphyxiation after his respirator broke down in his home. He was thirty-seven years old. Broun was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Dalton School. He attended Reed College in Portland. He was the son of Heywood Hale Broun, the writer and broadcaster, and the grandson of Ruth Hale, a freelance writer and founder of the Lucy Stone League, and Heywood Broun, the newspaper columnist."

He was the son of John Mayhew Esq of Platt Bridge House, Co. Lancaster, and Elizabeth Mayhew (née Rapley), JP Lancashire (1876), JP Flintshire (1888), Deputy Lieutenant (1900), and High Sheriff of Flintshire (1904). Educated at King William’s College, Isle of Man, Mayhew began his career as an apprentice with the Wigan, Coal and Iron Company Ltd. Mayhew soon established himself as a preeminent mining engineer managing and part-owning collieries throughout the Wigan district. He became Managing Director of the Brinsop Hall Colliery Company working in partnership with A. H. Leech. Wigan experienced dramatic economic growth and the population grew rapidly as the coal and textile industry expanded in the 1870s and 1880s. Mayhew was well connected. His brother Walter was Mayor of Wigan between 1876 and 1878 and in 1883 Mayhew formed a partnership with W. E. Gladstone, then Prime Minister. He started managing Gladstone’s extensive collieries and brickworks in Hawarden and in 1888 took over Halls Collieries at Swadlincote, Burton-on-Trent employing close to 2,000 mineworkers."

Kennedy and Martin Luther King. He wrote ten self-published and published books and approximately thirty-five unpublished books related to the details for those assassinations, mostly with respect to Kennedy's assassination. Weisberg was a strong critic of the Warren Commission report and of the methods used in investigating President Kennedy's murder. In this regard, he was avant-garde, embarking on a course that many other conspiracy theorists would later come to follow. Weisberg is best known for his seminal work, Whitewash, where he wrote: \"Following thousands of hours of research in and analysis of the vast, chaotic, deliberately disorganized, padded and largely meaningless 26 volumes of the testimony and exhibits of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy and its 900-page Report – millions of words of which are not needed and are merely diversionary – I published the results of my investigation in a book, Whitewash: The Report on the Warren Report. In this book, I establish that the inquiry into the assassination was a whitewash, using as proof only what the Commission avoided, ignored, misrepresented and suppressed of its own evidence.\" On February 21, 2002, Weisberg died of cardiovascular disease at his home in Frederick, Maryland."

He came from an old Westphalian family, the son of a diplomat, Karl von Freytag-Loringhoven (1811–1882). He entered the Imperial German army in 1877, a few years after German unification, as a lieutenant. From 1887 to 1896 he taught military history at the Prussian Military Academy in Berlin. He then worked for a while for Alfred von Schlieffen, later being described as \"Schlieffen's favorite disciple\", and in 1907 took command of the 12th Regiment of Grenadiers at Frankfurt an der Oder. In 1910 he became Oberquartiermeister, and in December 1913 took command of the 22nd Division at Cassel. With the mobilisation of troops in 1914 for World War I, he became firstly a liaison officer with the Austro-Hungarian forces. He then returned to the Supreme Army Command as Stellvertretender Generalquartiermeister (Deputy Quartermaster-General), where he became an unofficial adviser to Erich von Falkenhayn although he bemoaned his lack of influence. He briefly led the 9th Reserve Corps, then the 17th Reserve Division, and in September 1916 went back to the Supreme Army Command. On April 18, 1918 he was promoted to General of the Infantry. His published works include: \n*  Deductions from the World War the English translation of Folgerungen aus dem Weltkriege (1918) His son Leopold married the Dadaist artist and poet Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven."

  "text" : "Hasculf de Tany (sometimes Harscoit or de Tani; died before 1140) was a nobleman in medieval England and castellan of the Tower of London. Hasculf's family originally was from Brittany, but came to England from Tanis, in the Avranchin in Normandy. Hasculf married Matilda, whose parentage is disputed: according to Katharine Keats-Rohan she was the daughter of Roger and her father's heiress for lands he had held of John fitzWaleran in Essex. According to I. J Sanders, Matilda was possibly the daughter of John fitzWaleran, and perhaps Hasculf was the son of Roger who held lands from John fitzWaleran. If Matilda was the daughter of John fitzWaleran, she was heiress to Aveley in Essex, and that holding was considered a barony: Sanders states that Hasculf was thus baron of Aveley. The historian Judith Green states that there are errors in Sanders' entry for Aveley, but does not give any corrections. By 1120 Hasculf de Tany was castellan of the Tower of London, succeeding Otuel fitzCount in that office. Before 1130 Hasculf was involved in a dispute with Rualon d'Avranches over some lands in Essex, which was resolved after a court case in which was levied a fine of 60 marks and a warhorse on Rualon. Around 1130 Hasculf was the witness on a royal charter of Henry I to London. In late 1136 or 1137 Hasculf was tried before King Stephen of England and the Lord Chancellor Roger le Poer, accused by the Holy Trinity Priory in London of confiscating land belonging to the priory. In the end, the priory regained custody of their land. After Hasculf's death, his castellanship of the Tower went to Geoffrey de Mandeville, and was held to be hereditary. Hasculf de Tany and his wife Matilda gave lands to Bermondsey Priory, and also confirmed her father's gifts to that monastery in 1107. Hasculf was dead sometime before 1140, and left a minor son Graelend as his heir. According to Keats-Rohan, Gilbert de Tany may also have been the son of Hasculf."

  "text" : "Helen C. White (November 26, 1896 – June 7, 1967) was a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. White twice served as the English department chair and was the first woman to become a full professor in the university's College of Letters and Science. She was also the first woman elected president of the American Association of University Professors, and a president of the American Association of University Women (AAUW), University of Wisconsin Teachers' Union, and University Club. White wrote six novels and numerous nonfiction books and articles. White was raised in Boston in a Roman Catholic household, and kept the faith for the rest of her life. She graduated from the Girls' High School and Radcliffe College. After completing her master's degree, she taught at Smith College for two years before moving West to study for her doctorate in Madison. White loved the city and became an assistant professor there upon completing her Ph.D. in 1924 with a dissertation on William Blake. She taught courses including freshman English and metaphysical poetry graduate seminars. White's students included writers such as August Derleth, Herbert Kubly, and Mark Schorer. Graduate students called her \"the Purple Goddess\" partly due to her predominantly purple wardrobe and exceptional height. In her 48-year career, White received 23 honorary doctorates, a Laetare Medal, a Siena Medal, an AAUW achievement award, and two Guggenheim Fellowships. She became an Honorary Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1958 for her scholarship. White was a United States delegate at two UNESCO events and was on the boards of several organizations. Upon her death, the university built Helen C. White Hall in her name. The building houses the university's English department and undergraduate library, which contains 4,000 books from White's collection."

  "text" : "Herbert Cowley (1885 – November 1967, Newton Abbot, Devon) was a botanist, gardener, garden photographer and garden writer who edited The Garden journal from 1915 to the mid 1920s and wrote many gardening books until retiring in 1936. Cowley was a member of the Kew Guild and active in the Kew Guild for Old Kewites, former and serving Kew Gardens staff. he also edited the Kew Guild Journal. After four years as journal editor or sub-editor from 1909 to 1914 and military service 1914 to 1915, he became editor of The Garden in 1915/16 and carried on as a gardening writer until around 1936. His father Henry Cowley (died 3 April 1930 at Easton, Portland, Dorset) was a 'domestic gardener' on Census records. Father Henry and mother Mary Ann Cowley are listed as living in Wantage, Berkshire in the 1920s. Herbert worked at Lockinge Gardens in Berkshire before studying at Swanley College for two years, one of the last eight men students before it became a female horticultural college around 1902. He worked for the royal garden at Frogmore and after Swanley for the famous nursery family of Veitch's at Feltham. Cowley joined the staff of Kew Gardens, eventually settling in the Orchid department in 1905. Herbert Cowley was involved in Kew's Mutual Improvement Lectures in the 1906/7 season. Sadly this prewar lecture lists contain the names of some of other Kew staff including C.F. Ball who would soon be killed on active service. His Kew Guild Journal obituary in 1968 mentions prewar plant hunting trips to the Dolomites and a notable visit to Bulgaria as a guest of King Ferdinand in the company of Kew contemporary C.F. Ball of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin in Dublin. Ball was killed as a Private in the Royal Dublin Fusilers on 13 September 1915 as part of the Gallipoli campaign. Ball's obituary in The Garden was written by his Kew contemporary and editor friend Cowley. Cowley left Kew around 1907 to join The Gardener magazine as a subeditor (later called Popular Gardening). Herbert Cowley became Assistant Editor or Sub-Editor at a different title, The Garden in 1910. This was the magazine he was to return to as Editor after military service in 1915/6 until c. 1926. Cowley then edited Gardening Illustrated from 1923-26. He appears also to have written garden articles for Country Life after 1911. He also worked (probably in the late 1920s) for Wallace & Co of Tunbridge Wells, nursery-men and landscape architects. He wrote his final book The Garden Year at Tunbridge Wells in 1936."

  "text" : "Herta Glaz (also spelled Hertha; September 16, 1910, Vienna - January 28, 2006, Hamden, Connecticut) was an American operatic mezzo-soprano, voice teacher, and opera director of Austrian birth. She became a United States citizen in 1943. She was a fixture at the Metropolitan Opera between 1942-1956 where she sang in more than 300 performances. She was also highly active with the San Francisco Opera between 1944-1951. Some of the roles she portrayed on stage were Marcellina in Le Nozze di Figaro, Annina, Siegrune in Die Walküre, Flosshilde in Götterdämmerung and Magdalene in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. In her later years, Glaz became a celebrated voice teacher and opera director. She taught voice at the Manhattan School of Music from 1956-1977, University of Southern California from 1977-1994, the Aspen Music Festival from 1987-1994, and privately from her homes in New Haven and Los Angeles. Her notable pupils included sopranos Susan Davenny Wyner and Sally Sanford, and mezzos Gail Dubinbaum, Jacalyn Kreitzer, and Cynthia Munzer. In 1963 she founded the New Haven Opera Society which later became the New Haven Opera Theater (NHOT). She served as NHOT's director until the company disestablished due to financial reasons in 1976. With the company she presented 12 seasons of fully staged opera productions, as well as a highly active schedule of opera performances for school children. Glaz was trained at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna and the Mozarteum University of Salzburg. She married several times during her life: first to conductor Joseph Rosenstock and then to Viennese composer Paul August Csonka. Her third and last marriage was to Viennese psychiatrist Frederick Redlich which lasted nearly fifty years. Redlich was notably the Dean of the Yale University School of Medicine."

  "text" : "Heimo Haitto (22 May 1925 – 9 June 1999) was a Finnish-American classical violinist who played in several U.S. symphony orchestras. A child prodigy, he was characterized as “Finland’s Jascha Heifetz”. Heimo Haitto was born in Vyborg, Finland, to a family in which the father, a locomotive driver, was an amateur violinist. The son started to play violin as well, and the Russian-born pedagogue Boris Sirpo (1893–1967) took him not only as a student but as a foster son and raised him in Vyborg. In 1939, the 13-year-old Haitto made his début with the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, and later that year he won the British Council violin competition. The young violinist become famous, and his story inspired a fictional film, Pikku pelimanni (The Little Player) of 1939, in which Haitto played the leading role. During the Winter War, Haitto partook a Red Cross concert tour which also visited the United States for the benefit of Finland. Haitto played in the Carnegie Hall with Sir John Barbirolli, among other venues, and appeared in the 1941 film The Hard-Boiled Canary. In 1942 Haitto and Sirpo settled down in Portland, Oregon, and Haitto studied with Ivan Galamian in 1943–1945. Haitto was known for his virtuosity: he played the compositions of Niccolò Paganini in a faultless way, and he loved the music of J. S. Bach. In 1945 Haitto became U.S. citizen and he married the cellist Beverly Le Beck, a wealthy heiress. They moved to Hollywood and Haitto worked with the film industry, then he joined the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and played there till 1956. During 1940s–1960s years he also toured Finland and was awakened to Christianity in 1956. He played shorter periods also as a leader in the Metropolitan Opera orchestra and Hawaii Symphony. Haitto and Le Beck had two children, Nick and Kaarina. After that, Haitto and his family moved to Switzerland and then Mexico, where he got the position of the leader in the Bellas Artes symphony orchestra, but ultimately his wife filed for a divorce because of his alcoholism and gambling. A dramatic change followed: Haitto left his family altogether, abandoned the violin and started to live as a vagabond in the U.S. and in Canada. The wandering life lasted till mid-1970s when Haitto met the journalist Eva Vastari and they were married in Las Vegas in 1976. Haitto started to work as a musician again: he toured with his wife, accompanying her poetry recitals, first in the U.S., then they settled in Finland. He played in the Savonlinna Orchestra and the Joensuu Orchestra and taught at Savonlinna Conservatoire. He wrote two volumes of memoirs, remembering his wandering years. Another film about his life followed in 1985: Da Capo by Pirjo Honkasalo and Pekka Lehto. In the 1990s, Haitto suffered from hearing problems and he wasn’t able to play anymore. He spent his last years in Marbella, Spain, with his wife, and died in 1999. He was buried in Marbella, but five years later his remains were moved to Helsinki, Hietaniemi cemetery. According to the biographer Anneli Mäkelä-Alitalo, the tragedy of Haitto’s life was grounded on his early separation from his parents. Although the boy was talented, he wasn’t properly prepared for everyday life. Haitto made several EP, LP and tape recordings. Most of his recordings he did for Finnish Broadcasting Company Yleisradio. In 2013, some archival radio recordings of Yleisradio from 1964 were released on a CD. Haitto plays the Violin Concerto and six Humoresques by Jean Sibelius."

  "text" : "Hiroyuki Suzuki (鈴木博之) (May 14, 1945 – February 3, 2014) was a prominent Japanese architectural historian who also established a reputation abroad. For most of his career Suzuki was Professor of the History of Architecture at the University of Tokyo (1974-2009), and for a period was also Chairman of Tokyo University's Graduate School of Architecture. Later in life he joined the faculty of the School of Cultural and Creative Studies at Aoyama University. He was the author of over a dozen books and countless articles in Japanese, but was best known to English readers as the co-author (with Reyner Banham and Kobayashi Katsuhiro) of Contemporary Architecture of Japan, 1958-1984 (New York: Rizzoli,1985) and Shuhei Endo: Paramodern Architecture (Phaidon Press, 2006), among others. His Japanese-language scholarship ranged from research on such prominent Meiji-period figures as Josiah Conder and Itō Chūta (伊東忠太), to many works on contemporary Tokyo, a city to which he was strongly attached. He was among the first architectural historians inside or outside Japan to focus on Meiji and Taisho-period architects and architecture, and argue for continuities between this and the later post-war period when Japanese 'modern' architecture became globally influential. Suzuki was a strong proponent of preserving \"modern\", and not just \"traditional\" Japanese architecture, and did not shy from wading into development controversies. As chairman of the Japanese branch of the Paris-based conservation group Docomomo International, he oversaw drafting of a list of 135 \"modern\" Japanese structures worthy of protection. He was a prominent member of the Architectural Consortium that in 2012 received the World Monuments Fund / Knoll Modernism Prize for saving and restoring the Hizuchi Elementary School in Shikoku, designed by Masatsune Matsumura in the late 1950s. He also consulted on the restoration of Tokyo Station. For twelve years (1996-2008) Suzuki was one of three members of the Ad Hoc Group of Experts at the Coordinating Committee of Angkor (ICC), advising the Cambodian government on the preservation of Angkor Wat Among many honors, Suzuki is a recipient of Japan's Medal of Honor (褒章 hōshō) with Purple Ribbon for his service to scholarship."

He was a high school teacher of Arabic language and literature, a poet in both Arabic and Persian, and an activist who promoted Arabic culture and literature in Iran. In February 2011, government authorities arrested Shabani and four other Ahwazi Arabs, apparently for their role in promoting Arab cultural activities. In December 2011, a programme aired on Iran's Press TV in which Shabani and two other Ahwazi Arabs confessed to being part of an armed Arab terrorist group. Human rights groups say these confessions were coerced under torture. In July 2012, Shabani and the four others arrested with him were sentenced to death on charges of Moharebeh (\"waging war on God\"), sowing corruption on earth, acting against national security, and spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic. The Iranian Supreme Court upheld the death sentences in January 2013, and on 27 January 2014, Shabani was executed along with fellow Ahwazi Arab Hadi Rashedi."

After leaving The New York Times to run his own newspapers, Alloway maintained a regular column in the Wall Street Journal, “By-the-Bye,” which appeared regularly for fourteen years. Alloway was born into a quaker family near Dover, Delaware, and began his career with the Exeter News-Letter.

  "text" : "Helmut Erich Deutsch (born 24 December 1945) is an Austrian classical pianist, specialising in chamber music and lieder accompaniment. Deutsch was born in Vienna, where he taught piano, composition and musicology at the Vienna Music Academy from 1967 until 1979. He was awarded the Vienna Composition Prize in 1967. He was professor for lied interpretation and performance (Professor für Liedgestaltung) at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater München (University of Music and Performing Arts Munich) from 1986 until 2011. He is still guest professor there and at other German universities. He has been teaching at the Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst Frankfurt and the Frankfurt Opera. Deutsch gives master classes throughout Europe and in Japan and is a juror at the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition. Deutsch began his career as accompanist working with Irmgard Seefried, and he collaborated with Hermann Prey for more than twelve years. Other prominent singers he accompanied were Olaf Bär, Barbara Bonney, Grace Bumbry, Ileana Cotrubaș, Diana Damrau, Annette Dasch, Brigitte Fassbaender, Matthias Goerne, Hans Hotter, his former student Jonas Kaufmann, Angelika Kirchschlager, Keith Lewis, Anne Sofie von Otter, Josef Protschka, Andreas Schmidt, Peter Schreier, Bo Skovhus, Rita Streich, Michael Volle and Bernd Weikl. Among his many collaborative recordings are the complete vocal works of Johannes Brahms. Deutsch performed in recitals at the Salzburg Festival with Olaf Bär (1999), Jonas Kaufmann (2009), Hermann Prey (1982, 1984, 1985, 1991), Thomas Quasthoff (2012), and Michael Volle (2010, 2012). A review of a 2011 CD of songs by Liszt, sung by Diana Damrau, noted: Frequently the piano line in these settings is just as complex, intense and as interesting as the vocal part which is not surprising given Liszt renown as a virtuoso pianist and Helmut Deutsch proves himself a truly outstanding interpreter."

  "text" : "Harlow Wilcox (March 12, 1900 - September 24, 1960) was an American radio announcer. Radio shows for which Wilcox was announcer included Amos 'n' Andy, The Baby Snooks Show, Ben Bernie, Fibber McGee and Molly, Frank Merriwell, Hap Hazard, Hollywood Premiere, Suspense, The Victor Borge Show Your Electric Servant, Blondie Boston Blackie and The Passing Parade. Wilcox came from a show business-oriented family, with a father who played in the Ringling Brothers' band and a sister who played violin both in vaudeville and in classical concerts. Continuing the trend, Harlow took vocal lessons and briefly performed on stage. He eventually decided to try radio and met Jim and Marian Jordan at a station in Chicago. An April 1944 article in Radio Mirror magazine reported:Jim and Marion [sic] Jordan were just getting a toehold in radio in Chicago then and Wilcox helped them cut some records. When the pair landed their own radio show, they asked for Wilcox as their announcer. The future triumphs of the trio are well known to all Fibber McGee and Molly fans. When the Jordans moved out to Hollywood in 1939, Wilcox went with them and now, even when Fibber McGee and Molly leave the air for their annual summer vacations on their ranch, Wilcox carries on, announcing the sponsor's substitute show.Wilcox became \"one of the most successful announcers and pitchmen in radio.\" He was the announcer for Fibber McGee and Molly (his first network program) throughout the show's run in a 30-minute format. He also was a pioneer in making commercials a part of a program's story rather than something simply inserted during a break. The \"Wistful Vista\" website put it this way:Wilcox was one of the masters of the integrated commercial, a technique that was popularized on Ed Wynn's and Jack Benny's shows. Instead of stopping the story for the mid-show commercial, Wilcox would just show up and work his plug into the plot, much to Fibber's consternation. Fibber tagged Wilcox with the nickname \"Waxy\" for his ability to turn any conversation topic to Johnson's Wax ...An article in a Smithsonian Institution newsletter described Wilcox's role in integrating commercials into stories as follows:A standard joke on the popular comedy Fibber McGee and Molly was the arrival of Johnson's Wax salesman Harlow Wilcox. He knocked at their door as just another person in their stream of visitors, but no matter what the conversation had been about before his arrival, Wilcox somehow managed to turn it to floor wax within a few moments, and then struggled to promote his product over the continuing action around him.As was generally true of radio personalities, most people's impressions of Harlow Wilcox came solely from hearing him on the air. One writer, however, recorded her perceptions as a member of the studio audience at the Fibber McGee and Molly broadcast Dec. 5, 1946. In her \"By-ways\" column, Florence Burlingame Taylor wrote:Harlowe [sic] Wilcox was introduced as a young lad, just getting a start in radio. This was before Harlowe appeared, and Fibber had us believing that Harlowe was ill. How we applauded the popular Harlowe! He is a handsome, debonair man-about-town -- at least 40, gray-haired, with crisp gray mustache, tall, with all the poise of a veteran announcer. In addition to his announcing roles, Wilcox also acted in an episode of the TV version of You Are There and in two movies, Look Who's Laughing and They're Off. In the 1950s, Wilcox was executive vice president of Rockett Pictures, Inc., a film production company in Hollywood, California."

  "text" : "Harald Lindberg (2 November 1871, Helsinki – 13 March 1963, Helsinki) was a Finnish botanist of Swedish parentage. He was the son of botanist Sextus Otto Lindberg (1835–1889). He studied natural sciences at the University of Helsinki, later spending several years working as a secondary school teacher. In 1910 he obtained his PhD at Helsinki with a dissertation on Alchemilla vulgaris. Afterwards, he served as first custodian at the botanical museum in Helsinki, where he remained until his retirement in 1941. Throughout his career, he collected and studied Fennoscandian flora that included subfossil specimens and bryophytes. He also made important contributions in his investigations of plants native to southern Europe and northern Africa; Spain, Sicily, Greece, Cyprus, Morocco, et al. In 1932 he visited Britain and Ireland, where he collected specimens from the genus Taraxacum. As a taxonomist, he is credited with describing 150 new botanical species. From 1906 to 1945 he was tasked with compilation of the \"Plantae Finlandiae Exsiccatae\". In 1969 the grass genus Lindbergella was named in his honor by Norman Loftus Bor. In the field of entomology he published the treatise \"Coleoptera insularum Canariensium\" (1958)."

When singing, he sits down on a chair, and makes vigorous movements with his hands, and it seemed to me remarkable that he often struck with the right hand to the heart, while he never touched the right side with the left. His singing was limited to four or five tones, and the words seemed primarily to consist from the sounds ae, i, o, his voice is not creaky, you could call it a pleasant tenor voice, but the presentation of the song with these strange movements made quite the impression as if you saw a madman." ]

  "text" : "Born in Berlin, Feist first studied with Émile Jaques-Dalcroze in Hellerau, Dresden, in 1914 before moving back to Berlin in 1917 to study under Olga Desmond. Thereafter she joined Rudolf von Laban, following him to various locations in the north of Germany and participating in his majestic Tanzbühne productions. In 1923, she established her own school in Berlin and also taught at Carl Diem's sports academy, successfully combining gymnastics with nudism and dance. She continued to dance in Laban's productions, starring as Donna Elvira in his Don Juan (1926). Her school's freestyle movements were pictured at the Berlin Stadium. In 1927 she appeared in the only film made by the American Stella Simon. The avant-garde film entitled Hands: The Life and Love of a Gentle Sex had its own score by Marc Blitzstein and it tells of an eternal triangle story using just the hands and forearms of the dancers. In 1928, Feist toured with the Novembergruppe, presenting her Der Berufung in Germany, Poland, Switzerland and England. Her last major production was Gluck's Iphigénie en Aulide performed on the steps of the Pergamon Museum in May 1933. Her ambitions were then curtailed by the Nazis who closed her school and forced her to move into smaller quarters although she continued to attract many students. After the war, she taught at the Volkshochschule Hannover from 1952 to 1965. Her last dance was performed for the inauguration of the Golden Rosenkreuz Temple at Bad Münder in 1965 where she lived at the time. From 1983, she returned to live in Hannover where she died on 9 July 1990."

The poem Skinnvengbrev (\"A Bat's Letter\") is by Aslaug Vaa and was also later set by Geirr Tveitt; it begins \"Eg trudde eingong du hadde gøymt deg, at både du og Gud ha gløymt meg,..\" (English: \"Once I thought you had gone hiding, that I was forgotten by you and By God, and I was the least of created things\"). Kirsten Flagstad recorded Lie's orchestral song, together with a less well known song by Lie, Nykelen (\"The Key\"), with the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Øivin Fjeldstad."

Having studied geology, she was hired by Flinders at age 25 as an artist, which led to their marriage and a working partnership that endured for their lifetimes. Hilda travelled and worked with Flinders to excavate and record numerous sites in Egypt, and later in Palestine. This included directing some excavations herself, and working in often difficult and dangerous conditions to produce copies of tomb hieroglyphs and plans, and to record the work for reports to the Egypt Exploration Fund. When the British School of Archaeology in Egypt was founded in 1905 in London by Flinders Petrie, she worked as its secretary and fundraiser to secure support for the school and their continued excavations. Hilda took part in archaeological excavations and surveys throughout her married life, except for a period while their two children were young. Her work was published, and she also gave public lectures in London and elsewhere."

In 1912, Hal was appointed Censor to the Universal Film Corporation. Reid was at one time said to be actually Harry Preston and that he had served a prison sentence for an unspecified crime. His parents were Hugh McMillan Reid (1836-1911) and America Elizabeth Reid (1840-1903). Hal was married three times with each woman bearing him a child. His first wife was Marylee Withers (1866-1943), m. 1879, who at 16 produced a daughter, Hazel Withers Reid in 1882. Hazel died in 1921 a year after her father. Wife two was Bertha Westbrook (1867-1939), m. 1889, who produced son Wallace in 1891 or '92. Wife three was the much younger Marcella (1899-1993), m. 1916, who also produced a son, James Hillock Reid (1918-1969). His son Wallace Reid became an actor who starred in many films of Hollywood's silent era."

Henri Boffin received his PhD in 1993 from the Université libre de Bruxelles for his work on the formation of barium stars and has since gone on to work on a variety of problems in the study of binary stars. Most recently, he has dedicated his time to the study of binary stars in planetary nebulae, including discovering the binary central star of Fleming 1, and the use of optical interferometry to study mass-transfer. He is also extremely active in science communication, having been coordinator of the International Year of Astronomy 2009 Gigagalaxy Zoom project, as well as being interviewed about his work in a wide range of publications. Boffin named the main-belt asteroid 37392 Yukiniall after his two sons, Yuki and Niall. Naming citation was published on 24 July 2002 (M.P.C. 46112)."

St Huna also conducted her funeral. After her death, Huna left Ely to become a hermit on an island in the Cambridgeshire fens. His residence on the island was called Huneia and later known as Honey Hill, or Honey Farm, which is located just outside the town of Chatteris. St Huna was considered a holy man and his grave on the small island was known for producing healing miracles. Later Huna's relics were translated from Chatteris to Thorney, at the time more a collection of hermit cells than a monastic institution. His Feast day is 13 February."

  "text" : "Hugh Baillie (October 23, 1890 – March 1, 1966) was an American journalist best known as the head of UP (United Press Associations), the leading rival to the Associated Press. As president 1935-1955, he was an overall charge of business operations, and dealings with his correspondents and subscribing newspapers. Baillie was the son of a prominent journalist in New York, and joined UP in 1915 after attending the University of Southern California. He personally interviewed top European leaders in the coming of World War Two, including Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Neville Chamberlain. He covered the American invasion of Sicily in 1943, and the Belgian campaign in 1944, in which he was wounded. After the war Baillie continued with his interviews of famous world leaders, such as the heads of Japan, China, and the Soviet Union. Baillie was a leader in promoting freedom of news dissemination and called in 1944 for an open system of news sources and transmission, and a minimum of government regulation of the news. His proposals were aired at the Geneva Conference on Freedom of Information in 1948, but were blocked by the Soviets and by France. He strongly supported General Douglas MacArthur and his conduct of the Korean War, making sure that his reporters and editors covered it thoroughly. At the time of his retirement, UP had 2900 clients in the United States, and 1500 abroad."

Henok's sudden disappearance from competition and similarity to Homiyu Tesfaye Heyi (an Ethiopian now competing for Germany who suddenly appeared in 2010) generated discussion. A number of German coaches and athletes claimed Henok and Homiyu were the same runner – a suggestion that would mean Homiyu would have been competing in age category competitions that he was too old for. Homiyu denied the resemblance or any knowledge of Henok."

  "text" : "Henri A. Levy (September 12, 1913 – March 25, 2003) was an American physicist and crystallographer who made contributions in the field of neutron scattering by crystalline materials. Levy was born in Oxnard, California and gained both his bachelor's degree and PhD at Caltech, in 1935 and 1938 respectively. His PhD was supervised by Linus Pauling. Following a postdoctoral position with Pauling, Levy moved to Clinton Laboratories (now Oak Ridge National Laboratory) where he spent the rest of his career. He built on the work of Ernest O. Wollan and Clifford G. Shull in determining the structure of crystalline solids such as Xenon tetrafluoride, sucrose and glucose using neutron diffraction. His work particularly focused on determining the positions of hydrogen atoms in crystals, something that neutron diffraction can do with higher precision than X-ray diffraction. He pioneered automated methodology for neutron diffraction studies, along with several computer programs for analysis of crystallographic data. In his later life, Levy worked on electron tomography of large biological complexes, particularly those transcribing DNA. Levy Island, in Crystal Sound, Antarctica, is named in honor of Levy's 1957 work with SW Peterson determining the position of hydrogen atoms in an ice crystal using neutrons. He was president of the American Crystallographic Association in 1965."

  "text" : "Henry Danton (born 30 March 1919) is a British dancer, teacher, and stager of classical ballet. Danton was a prolific dancer in London during and immediately after World War II. In the UK, Danton performed as a soloist in the International Ballet partnering Mona Inglesby in Les Sylphides and Swan Lake 1943-44, and with the Sadler’s Wells Ballet 1944-46, where he appeared with Margot Fonteyn, Beryl Grey, and Violetta Elvin in the Rose Adagio and Pamela May in Les Sylphides and created leading roles in a number of works, most notably in Sir Frederick Ashton’s Symphonic Variations partnering Moira Shearer. Privately educated with Judith Espinosa, he passed the Royal Academy of Dancing’s four exams with honours winning the Adeline Genée Silver Medal after just 18 months of classical ballet training. During the war Danton studied intensively with the Russian teacher Vera Volkova. In 1946, he began his international dancing career travelling first to Paris to work with some of the leading Russian teachers of the day, including Victor Gsovsky, and the Imperial Russian Ballet ballerinas Olga Preobrajenska, Lubov Egorova and Mathilde Kschessinskaya. As a dancer, Danton appeared with touring ensembles across the UK, Europe, Australasia and South America partnering ballerinas Svetlana Beriosova, Elsa Marianne von Rosen, Colette Marchand, Celia Franca, Irene Skorik, Lycette Darsonval, Sonia Arova, Mia Slavenska, Lynne Golding and others. As a teacher and balletmaster, Danton has worked extensively across the US and South America for more than 65 years, teaching, coaching and staging classical repertoire. An important influence on the nascent national ballet companies in Caracas, Venezuela, and Bogota, Colombia, he was also the first classical ballet teacher to be employed at the Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, and the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, and taught at the Fokine School of Ballet, Ballet Arts, Carnegie Hall, and the Juilliard School in New York City. In 2013, at aged 95, Danton continued to teach in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and also worked as a guest teacher at a number of schools and colleges including Belhaven University, where he staged Mikhail Fokine’s Les Sylphides in the autumn of 2013."

At the time, teachers of color were paid significantly less than their white colleagues. Brown was paid almost 50% less than her white counterparts with similar credentials. Calvert County settled on December 27, 1937 and agreed to equalize pay. Two years later, the Maryland Teachers Pay Equalization Law was passed, the first Maryland state equalization law. Brown is honored in the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame."

Chamberlin moved in the 1930s from New York to California. He worked at a Federal Theatre Project, where he met his wife Leona, and at the Pasadena Playhouse. He made his film debut in the 1946 drama The Best Years of Our Lives, which won seven Oscars. In the next years, he often portrayed nervous figures in film noir. Although Chamberlin's appearance was uncredited, he was memorable as the cynical hotel receptionist in 1952's High Noon. High Noon remained Chamberlin's last film for 25 years, because he was blacklisted by the House of Un-American Activities and did not get any film roles. He returned to working in New York, where he worked as a stage actor. In 1977 he made his screen comeback in the TV film A Touch of the Poet. He played Judge Atkins in the 1979 film Kramer vs. Kramer by Robert Benton. This was Chamberlain's third film in which a fellow cast member won the Oscar for Best Actor. Chamberlin worked as an actor until his death. Chamberlin died in Oakland, California on September 1, 1984."

When his service ended, he returned to Montréal and began social advocacy work. Gulkin then joined the Canadian Tribune, a communist weekly. There, he worked as an art critic and business manager. In 1970, he decided that he wanted to make films. His first major success was the 1975 drama Lies My Father Told Me. Adapted from the story by Ted Allan, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for best screenplay, and won a Golden Globe for best foreign film. From 1983 to 1987, Gulkin was director of the Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts. In 1987, he began a 20-year tenure as a project manager with the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles."

While working for Eisai, he graduated from Chuo University in 1969 and obtained his doctorate in pharmacology at Hiroshima University in 2002. His research on E2020 (now called Donepezil), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, first began at Eisai's Tsukuba Research Laboratories in 1983, because his mother suffered from dementia. At that time, there was a hypothesis suggested that acetylcholines were closely linked to abnormal decreases in memory function in patients with Alzheimer's disease. His research group was finally able to successfully create Donepezil with a promising enough profile for the compound to become a drug candidate. In 2003, he resigned from Eisai, and became Professor in the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University."

  "text" : "Hieronymus van Alphen (Gouda, 8 August 1746 – The Hague, 2 April 1803), a jurist in Utrecht, Leiden and The Hague, is especially remembered as a poet, particularly for his poems for children under the title Kleine gedigten voor kinderen (Utrecht 1778-1782). Van Alphen was appointed as Treasurer-General of the Dutch Republic in June 1793 but, as an Orangist, was relieved of his position as a result of the Batavian Revolution in 1795. Van Alphen’s children’s poems express a modern vision of children for his time. As these booklets were a great success, they were reprinted dozens of times and also translated into French, German, English, Frisian and in the Malay language. Composers as Bartholomeus Rulofs, Ernst Christian Graf and Christian Friedrich Ruppe put them to music. The affably poet Hieronymus van Alphen considers children as pure and innocent creatures, to whom virtues as obedience, esteem for their parents and for God, as well as modesty could be taught. Van Alphen was of the opinion that children should be able to learn playfully."

  "text" : "Henry Keyworth Raine ( 1872-1932), the great nephew of William Powell Frith, was an English school portrait oil painter. Born in York, he was the son of the Reverend James Raine and Ann Jane Keyworth. Raine was commonly known as 'The cellar artist '. The techniques he employed in his underground studio off Hanover square in the west end of London were an effort to recreate the style and results of artists he admired, such as Titian, Rembrandt and Velazquez. Painting by candlelight, using only three colours on his pallet and using specially commissioned black canvas, Raine was able to complete a portrait in a mere five hours, meaning the sitter would only need to visit his studio on one occasion. The interest in Raine spread across the world and stories revolving around his method of painting in the dark were printed. Many politicians, aristocrats and socialites became patrons of his work, including Sir Neville Chamberlain K.C.B, Lady Chamberlain, Lord and Lady Iveagh, Lord Kingston, The Countess of Shaftesbury, Lord Effingham, Sir Claude De Crespigny and Mrs. Fritz Ponsonby, the wife of the private secretary to the King. In 1895, Henry was commissioned to paint the portrait of Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, the sixth child of Queen Victoria at Kensington palace. York Art Gallery contains some examples of his work An extract from John Ward Knowles, history of York artists reads as follows: Raine, Keyworth. [Died 01/01/1934 aged 61]. Son of the Rev Chancellor Raine, the eminent antiquary. Educated first at St Peter's School and, after trying several occupations, he took up painting, without any preliminary training but with a faculty for imitation. His first attempt was to paint a portrait of one of the policemen at the Minster, which of course was very amateurish but had a resemblance of the man. He next operated on one of the vergers, Harland, with similar results and found that without a knowledge of drawing failure was evident. He then attended the York School of Art but the routine of training proved irksome. He, however, again attempted portraiture and, afterwards, paid a visit to his great uncle, Mr Frith, (who was then staying at his old home at Harrogate) to whom he showed his work. The advice was given with Mr Frith's usual frankness and to the effect \"that he was to study on proper lines and a proper master\". London was now sought and art was studied in its canonical manner but without a good result. He, therefore, returned to York and continued to paint in his own way, unfettered either by schools or individual methods. In 1895 he succeeded in obtaining a commission to paint Her Royal Highness the Princess Louise at Kensington Palace. After being thus honoured commissions were not wanting. The year following he made the painting of miniatures his chief study at which he succeeded, some of them being well modelled and carefully finished. In 1896 he made an offer to the Philosophical Society to paint a portrait of his late father, which he would present to the Society where his father had been such an active member and worker. This generous offer was accepted. In 1901 he exhibited four pictures in the York Fine Art Exhibition, one being a portrait of himself after the style of Rembrandt, which he had been recently studying. The study of Rembrandt's work seems to have resulted in the formulation of a new theory of chiaro obscuro, obtained by admitting only a narrow ray of light on to the sitter and painting the picture in almost absolute darkness. Mr Keyworth Raine fitted up such a studio in a cellar opposite St George's, Hanover Square and in it he painted several portraits which have caused much wonderment in art circles. In Oct 1904 The Archbishop of York paid a visit to this cellar studio and expressed great interest in the work. To test the genuineness of Mr Raine's method a challenge was sent to him to paint a portrait of Mr Edwin Drew \"under the conditions of darkness which he has selected in his cellar studio and to call in the press and public to watch the artist's method\". Mr Raine accepted the challenge and a room in the Hotel Metropole was fixed up on the principle Mr Raine adopted, and, in the presence of literary journalists and art critics, Mr Raine commenced his work at noon. At one o'clock he ceased and the picture was locked up. On the second day the painting was resumed at the same hour and the keenest interest was taken in its approach to completion. The last moment came and the artist laid down his brushes. The picture was placed in a gold frame and the curtains drawn to let in the daylight. \"All voiced the decision that Raine had discharged his task to the letter\". A fine portrait of power, originality and high appeal, done in the darkness, by an artist whose methods of new treatment, while all investigation was before the keenest critics, constituted an agreement for the painter's theory that all art lovers must regard. \"Mr Saul, the veteran RA, informed Mr Raine that to paint as he does in the dark is a most extraodinary thing and constitutes a great mystery. To use his own wrds he said to Mr Raine \"You are one of the riddles of 1904 and you will be the great riddle of 1905\" He afterwards had an exhibition of portraits in a room at 27a, Old Bond Street which was described as done \"with the Dutch method of colouring\" and the impression on entering was of a wealth of colour, a richness of tone and a disregard of the usual method of painting. The portraits comprised one of Lady Evelyn Guiness, Lady Marjorie Erskine, Miss Cynthia Fitzclarence, Miss Cooper, Mrs Turner Phillips and Mrs Hulton. The portrait of Mrs Turner Phillips being executed in eight hours. His studio was at the Queen Anne Studios, 60, Firth Street, Shaftesbury Avenue. 1909 At the exhibition of pictures in the Albert Hall, in July, several portraits by Keyworth Raine attracted much attention, one unfinished and unnamed, another of Lady Humphrey and a third of Countess Maffei[?], the general tone of which was a striking contrast to the majority of the portraits in the gallery, each having much in common with the Dutch school of painting. Mr Raine's work has caused much speculative opinion and describes his method as \"the short way through the difficulties of portraiture and the quickest way to advance in art\". Mr Raine also reverts back to the method of the early masters, who made their own colours and prepared their own canvas. Mr Raine's canvas is black and he uses the four primary colours, the first stage being painted in black and white, the work begun in darkness and finished in a bright stream of light. In the Graphic of March 26, 1921 is a portrait of the artist with a short account of him. He is represented nude to the waist and a candle on his head by which light he painted the picture which took him 5 months. It is now in the York Fine Art Exibition. In a leaflet Keyworth Raine states that he has, in 4 periods of his career, rediscovered the methods adopted by the Old Masters. The 1st was carried on under the tuition of W P Frith, 1897 to 1903. Sitters Archbishop William Maclagan, Countess of Shaftesbury, Right Hon F J Saville, Lady Wilmot and daughter. His own portrait, 1900. 2nd period Sept 1903 to May 1911. Half light, in a cellar as a studio, opposite St George's Church, Hanover Square. Sitters: Viscount Iveagh, Lady Evelyn Guiness and 27 commissions in Ireland, Sir John & Lady Arnott, Sir Neville and Lady Chamberlain, Lady Lillian Boyd, with others in Paris, Lady Magdalen, William Bulkely. The first in this period, Lady Alwyne Compton and the last, Hon Mrs Edward Littleton. 3rd period May 1911 to Nov 1912 was in full daylight to improve the method of colouring, Hon Mrs Geo Brooke, Sir Claude Champion de Crespigny, Sir Jas Hills-Johnes. The paintings of Van Eyck and Memling and the Castle Howard Mabuse, nearly 500 years old, are executed in the manner rediscovered during the middle of the third period and may be referred to for their perfect state of preservation. 4th period Jan 1913 shows development reached by applying the improved colouring of the 3rd period to lamplight. A portable lamp is used to obtain the same light in every case and the sitter choses the place and the hour. Preparing oil and crushing colour, which forms part of the rediscovery of Old Masters' methods, reached perfection in their hands with experience gained by whole schools, each artist adding something to general knowledge. Colours prepared wholesale by the Professional Artists' Colourman are not permanent if used with methods applied by the Old Masters. The sinking produced by time, and allowed for by modern portrait painters by painting thickly, cannot give the beauty obtained at first with the old Dutch method of colouring. Portraits have been painted in 8 County Houses in England, Ireland and France. An extract from Sir Joshua Reynolds XIVth Discourse - By candlelight not many objects appear more beautiful but from their being in a greater breadth of light and shadow as well as having a great breadth of uniformity of colour, nature in a higher style etc, etc....... to Guercino who is supposed to have painted by candlelight. Keyworth Raine's Portrait, April 7, 1921 is painted in the technique of the Old Masters and, so far as the torso is concerned, the work is very carefully executed, the anatomy being carefully defined but the flesh tone is far too leathery and heavy. The head is more life like and very well painted but, again, the flesh tones are too ruddy and the shadows heavy. Although he is supposed to hold a lighted candle above his head the lighting of the figure is from the front and not from the top. The picture is heavily varnished. Hanging directly opposite is a portrait of his father and a very good likeness. The painting of it is much better than that of K. Raine. A slight uncertainty hangs about the shadows of the cheek and mouth. Acct of Keyworth Raine in Graphic March 26, 1921 by Colin Cathcart who writes copiouly about his methods. 1926 A portrait of George Kirby, Curator of the Art Gallery has been painted by Mr K Raine and was presented to the Art Gallery Chairman at a meeting held at the Mansion House. York Herald July 30. Notes on Keyworth Raine work: 1896, I saw a portrait of his aunt Mrs Hodgkinson done in oils but miniature size. It was very carefully worked and well modelled and fairly good in colour, although too red for miniature work. The likeness also was absent. Also one of himself, very well painted both as to likeness, form and colour. 1899 He painted Canon Watson (Kit-Cat Club) and obtained a fairly good likeness, although somewhat incorrect in drawing, but the colouring was leathery, a fault he cannot overcome. (Exhibition at Hurworths). In Sept. the same year he painted Canon Fleming, which was good as a likeness but much wanting in dignity. It was better painted than Canon Watson's. 1901 He exhibited 4 pictures in the summer exhibition; A copy of Velasquez, very poor indeed. A study of a girl, after the style of the \"Master\", as also a portrait of himself in a Sombrero hat - both pictures were bad, bad in colour and bad in manipulation. Pictures painted by Keyworth Raine: Archbishop of York Countess of Shaftesbury Lord and Lady Iveagh Sir Neville and Lady Chamberlain Lord Effingham Lord March In 1903 Exhibition he exhibited a Portrait of Miss Cooper Bertram, son of Lord C Kerr , Portrait of himself, 15 x 12, painted Feb 1900, purchased by me April 1927."

When plans were announced to build a new Air Corps training facility, Clark designed his vision of an Air City in 1928. He submitted his drawings to Brigadier General Frank P. Lahm, who was sufficiently impressed enough to have Clark detailed to work for him as Randolph Air Force Base was built. His design of the Administration Building became known as the Taj Mahal and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The Randolph Field Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. His drawings for Randolph Air Force were donated to the Library of Congress. Clark served at various U.S. Air Force installations over the next two decades, and during World War II became commander of 52nd Troop Carrier Wing, Army Air Base at Pope Field in North Carolina, and the Troop Carrier Wing in the North African Theater of Operations."

  "text" : "Count Heinrich von Schlick zu Bassano und Weißkirchen (Moravia, 1580 – Vienna, 5 January 1650) was an Imperial Field Marshal and president of the Hofkriegsrat. As a young man, he fought in Hungary under Giorgio Basta for Rudolf II against Stephen Bocskay's revolt until 1604. Also served in the Spanish Army in Flanders, Julich and Milan. As a Lutheran, he sided with the Protestant Bohemians at the beginning of the Bohemian phase of the Thirty Years War, when the province was overrun by Imperial forces. As a competent officer his advice was often overlooked, especially at the Battle of White Mountain that took place on November 8, 1620. The battle was a defeat for the Protestant Bohemian's by Imperial forces. After the defeat he changed to the Imperial side and became a member of the Imperial War Council. Von Schlick continued fighting for the Imperial forces under Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, during the Danish Phase of the Thirty Years War 1626-1628. Von Schlick was at the Battle of Lutter fought on August 26–27, 1626. Von Schlick was also in command of an Infantry Regiment Schlick, composed of Bohemians. He ended his military career in 1630. At the request of the Emperor, he became president of the Hofkriegsrat in 1632, a post he would hold until 1649. He was one of the most important adversaries of Albrecht von Wallenstein. He returned a last time to the battlefield when Swedish general Königsmarck attacked Prague in July 1648. He died 18 months later. In 1644, he had become a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. Heinrich von Schlick converted in 1622 to the Catholic faith and married on 21 February 1623 with Anna Maria von Salm-Neuburg (1598–1647), with whom he had 2 children : Franz Ernst and Maria Sidonia."

Westermarck also made a significant contribution as a researcher through her cultural and historical works, among which are a series of biographies of female figures, Mathilda Rotkirch (1926), Adelaide Ehrnrooth (1928), and Rosina Heikel (1930).

  "text" : "Harris Goldsmith (November 23, 1935 – April 2, 2014 in New York City) was an American pianist, music teacher and classical music critic. Born in New York City, Goldsmith's family moved to Cuba for a year in 1938, to aid European Jews seeking to escape antisemitic persecution. Goldsmith studied at the Manhattan School of Music under Robert Goldsand. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in music from the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied with Robert Goldsand as a piano student. His early musical influences included conductors Arturo Toscanini and Guido Cantelli, and he was deeply affected by Cantelli's death in 1956. Goldsmith, known among his peers as an opinionated musician, was recommended by one of his instructors to become a music critic. Goldsmith began writing music criticism as a record reviewer for High Fidelity in 1960, where he became an influential voice during the \"heyday of the classical LP\". His friends claimed that he could remember \"every note of music he's ever heard\". In a 2013 interview with New York City culture critic Sara Fishko, he recalled a performance by Toscanini 60 years earlier: \"The one that really blew me away is the Eroica he did on December 6, 1953, because I already was well familiar with the piece from his 1949 recording\". While Goldsmith could be effusive over performances, he became well known early in his criticism career for his barbed reviews. Remembering a review of Chopin preludes performed by Alexander Brailowsky, he said, \"I really roasted it... I said, 'Alexander Brailowsky indulges in cliches and vagaries of taste. His performance is grotesque, fragmentary and clumsy.'\" He went on to write for High Fidelity's successor publication, Musical America, as well as contributing to Opus, the New York Post, and The New York Times. He also provided liner notes for many re-releases of classical music recordings, and organized a 12 disc set recordings by Guido Cantelli, which he annotated. He shared a 1995 Grammy Award for Best Historical Album for his liner notes accompanying The Heifetz Collection. Goldsmith played his debut piano performance in April 1965 at New York City's Town Hall. He made a number of recordings for various record labels in the 1970s, including a collection of Beethoven sonatas, and other releases of works by Johannes Brahms, Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann. Goldsmith was also a music teacher himself. He was a visiting professor at SUNY Binghamton, gave classes at the Eastman School of Music, and coached students at the Yale Summer School of Music. He was a professor of music literature and chamber music at Mannes College from 1994 until his death. Students he has worked with include noted pianists Cecile Licad and Jenny Lin."

Over three postwar decades, he assembled a “deeply personal” collection centered on thirty-three works by Paul Cézanne and more than forty by Vincent van Gogh, Amedeo Modigliani, Chaïm Soutine, Paul Gauguin, Édouard Manet, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and a dozen other European modernists. His eye for quality was “rarely matched in a private collection.”"

A few years later he was old enough to join his brother Albin in Landskrona BoIS. As soon as 1922, both he and Albin moved to neighbouring Helsingborg to play for Landskrona rivals Helsingborg IF. Unlike Albin, Harry only played one season in Helsingborg and then returned to Landskrona and BoIS in conjunction with the inaugural season of the first national Swedish league, Allsvenskan. Harry played eight seasons in Allsvenskan and retired after the 1931–32 season at age 30. His hope of playing for Sweden at the 1924 Olympics in Paris was thwarted by his supervisor at his workplace, Thulinverken, who refused to allow him to go."
