  "text" : "Isaac Briggs (1763-1825) was an American engineer, surveyor and manufacturer during the Early Republic. He lived much of his adult life with his family in Brookeville, Maryland.Briggs was born in Haverford, Pennsylvania in 1763 to Samuel and Mary Briggs, two Quakers. He studied engineering at the College of Pennsylvania (the University of Pennsylvania today), where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1783 and a master's degree in 1786. After his graduation, Briggs traveled, moving to Georgia and Georgetown, Washington, D.C. before he married Hannah Brooke and settled near Brookeville in Montgomery County, Maryland. On 1 February 1788, the Georgia legislature awarded Augusta inventor William Longstreet and his associate Isaac Briggs a patent for a steam engine. It is the only patent issued by the state because this was before the adoption of the Federal Constitution. In 1807 their engine was used to power a boat on a 5-mile journey against the current on the Savannah River. Only days before, Robert Fulton had sailed his new steamboat, the Clermont, from New York City up the Hudson River to Albany.) Briggs was a renowned surveyor and engineer. During 1791-1792, he assisted Andrew Ellicott in the survey of the boundaries of the original District of Columbia (see Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia). In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson appointed him to be the Surveyor General of the Mississippi Territory. He was also one of many chief engineers of the Erie Canal in New York and served as a chief engineer in Virginia on the James River and Kanawha Canal. He was also devoted to developing domestic agriculture and manufacturing. He co-founded the American Board of Agriculture and a cotton mill and manufacturing town at Triadelphia in Montgomery County, Maryland. Additionally, Briggs was a devout Quaker and a member of the American Philosophical Society. He was close friends with both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and was well-respected in his community. Briggs became ill while working on the James River and Kanawha Canal in Virginia. He died at \"Sharon,\" his family's home, in 1825."

Ibn al-Qasim had opinions which differed from those of Malik, to the point that it was said that he was dominated by opinion."

  "text" : "Isaac Parsons (January 7, 1814 – April 24, 1862) was an American planter, politician, and military officer in the U.S. state of Virginia (now West Virginia). Parsons served as a justice of the peace of Hampshire County's District 3 from 1852 to 1853. He later served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates representing Hampshire County from 1854 until 1857. Parsons was the grandson of Virginia House Delegate Isaac Parsons (1752–1796), the great-grandson of Colonial Virginia military officer William Foreman (died 1777), and the grandfather of First Lady of West Virginia, Edna Brady Cornwell (1868–1958). Parsons inherited his family's Wappocomo plantation north of Romney. In 1855, fugitive slave Jacob Green escaped from Parsons' Wappocomo plantation to Pennsylvania along with several other slaves. Parsons and his nephews went north to pursue the escapees, resulting in the arrest of his nephew, James \"Zip\" Parsons III (1831–1893). The arrest and trial of Parsons' nephew caused a dispute between the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania over the latter's refusal to execute the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Following the trial, a dispute ensued between Parsons and Charles James Faulkner over legal fees in 1857. At the time of the dispute, Faulkner was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Virginia's 8th congressional district. Parsons declared that Faulkner had originally offered his legal services at no cost during his nephew's trial. Following the onset of the American Civil War, Parsons served on Hampshire County's \"committee for safety\". Parsons received permission to raise an independent company of mounted infantry to provide defense along the border. He served as a military officer in the Huckleberry Rangers and Company K of the 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment in the Confederate States Army. Parsons died of natural causes following a skirmish with Union Army cavalry at Grassy Lick Run in 1862."

  "text" : "Irakli Gamrekeli (Georgian: ირაკლი გამრეკელი; 5 May 1894 – 10 May 1943) was a Georgian set designer and one of the founders of Georgian avant-garde stage design. Gamrekeli was born in Gori. His talent was discovered during an exhibition of his work by the leading Georgian theatre director Kote Marjanishvili, who was impressed by Gamrekeli's illustrations for Oscar Wilde's Salome. From 1922 to 1943 Gamrekeli worked with the Rustaveli Theatre, first under Marjanishvili and later under Sandro Akhmeteli, where he designed 50 productions, including William Shakespeare's Hamlet (1925), Sandro Shanshiashvili's Anzor (1928), Friedrich Schiller's The Robbers (1933) and Shakespeare's Othello (1937). Gamrekeli's picturesque designs, noted for their abstract geometric constructions and spacious but sparsely furnished dimensions, helped determine the monumental and heroic style characteristic of the Rustaveli Theatre. Later in his career, in the 1930s and 1940s, Gamrekeli worked for the Theatre of Opera and Ballet and the Griboyedov Russian Drama Theatre in Tbilisi. He also collaborated with the Georgian state film studio in Tbilisi: in 1929, he and fellow artist Valerian Sidamon-Eristavi worked on Kote Mikaberidze's ground-breaking expressionist film My Grandmother, but the film was banned by the Soviet censors for decades. Gamrekeli was also the art director of the films Arsena (1937) and Giorgi Saakadze (1942–1943). Besides stage design, Gamrekeli was also in 1924 chosen to design the layout of H2SO4 – the first and only publication of the eponymous Georgian avant-garde group of artists to which he belonged. He was awarded the title of Honored Artist of Georgia and the Order of the Badge of Honor. He died in Tbilisi in 1943 and was buried at the Didube Pantheon."

  "text" : "Ingerd Erlendsdotter (c. 1440-1526) was a Norwegian noblewoman and landowner during the 15th century. She was the daughter and ultimate heiress of Erlend Eindridsson (died ca. 1452) and Gudrun Olavsdotter (ca. 1415-1472). Her family estate, Losnegard (Losnaætten) was located on the island of Losna at the mouth of the Sognefjord in Sogn. Through inheritance and marriage, she became one of the larger landowners in Norway.She was commonly known as \"Lady Ingerd the Elder\" to distinguish her from her relative Inger Ottesdotter Rømer, the landowner of Austrått. She was married and widowed twice; Olav Guttormsson (died before 1485) and Arald Kane (died ca. 1497). She remained childless after her two marriages. After her death in 1526, the prospect of inheriting her assets affected the political acts of the nobility of Norway, Sweden and Denmark including members of the Rosenkrantz family."

  "text" : "Ian Peter Thomson (born 6 September 1949) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He also played for East Perth and East Fremantle in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). Thomson, a key position player, started his career at East Perth in 1967. He represented Western Australia in an interstate match against Victoria at Subiaco Oval on 17 July 1971. Before the beginning of the 1973 VFL season, Thomson was in talks to join Fitzroy, but was signed by South Melbourne. He played 20 games in his first year, as a centre half-back. In 1974 he appeared in all 22 rounds and took a club high 120 marks. Used up forward for much of the year, Thomson also kicked 24 goals. He broke an ankle bone in a 1975 pre-season practice match, which kept him out of the side until round five, then towards the end of the season suffered a knee injury, which restricted him to 13 games that season. The next year he played 19 games and had a six goal haul against St Kilda at Moorabbin Oval. In 1977 and 1978, Thomson was back at East Perth. He was only playing suburban football early in the 1979 season when he got recruited by East Fremantle, where he was used as a forward. It was at full-forward that he kicked four goals for East Fremantle in their 1979 WANFL Grand Final win over South Fremantle. With prolific goal scoring team mate Kevin Taylor at South Melbourne, Thomson topped East Fremantle's goal-kicking in 1981."

  "text" : "Ivan Yeliseevich Tsykler (Tzykler) (Russian: Ива́н Елисе́евич Ци́клер, before 1660 – 20 February [O.S. 4 March] 1697) was a Russian nobleman who was dismembered in 1697 on charges of conspiracy against Peter the Great. Tsykler was the son of a colonel from the foreign order regiment. He was drafted into military service in 1671, and appointed stolnik after eight years of service as a Strelets sub-colonel. In 1682, he became a companion to the statesmen Fyodor Shaklovity and Ivan Miloslavsky. He was a campaigner for Sophia of Russia, who trusted him as her most faithful follower. In 1687–1688, Tsykler took part in the first Crimean campaign of Vasily Galitzine. In 1689, after Peter I's revolt against Sophia, Tsykler informed him of Sophia's conspiracy; for this he was elevated to the rank of Duma nobleman and was sent as a voivode to Verkhoturie. In 1696, he was recalled to Moscow to build fortresses on the shore of the Azov sea. Many considered this appointment an honorable exile, but Peter I's increasing cruelty towards opponents of his reforms motivated Tsykler to plot against him. Other participants involved were okolnichiy Alexei Sokovnin and stolnik Matvei Pushkin. In February 1697, two Strelets, Yelizariev and Silin, notified Peter about Tsykler's plan to burn down the house in which the tsar was residing. Upon hearing this, Peter immediately personally arrested them and put them on trial. During the trial, Tsykler explained under torture that he was motivated by Peter's reproaches against his friendship with Miloslavsky. He also partially incriminated Sophia, leading to her imprisonment in the Novodevichy Convent. The exhumed corpse of Miloslavsky, who had died in 1685, was put under the scaffold during the execution of the conspirators. Following the execution on 20 February [O.S. 4 March] 1697, the heads of Tsykler and his accomplices were put on pikes and exhibited in Red Square. Trykler's two sons were exiled to Kursk and forbidden to return to Moscow under the tsar's decree."

  "text" : "(This article is about Zionist journalist. For other uses, see Israel Cohen (disambiguation).) Israel Cohen (1879–26 November 1961) was an Anglo-Jewish, Zionist leader, writer, and journalist. Born to Polish Jewish immigrants in Manchester, England in 1879, Israel Cohen was educated at Manchester’s Jews’ School (1884-1892), Manchester Grammar School (1892-1895); and then simultaneously at Jews’ College and University College, London, where he received his BA. From 1895 on, Cohen became actively involved in the Zionist cause. Upon reading an article in the Jewish Chronicle about pogroms in Russia, Cohen became interested in Jewish affairs and political matters in 1891. Following a speech given by Theodore Herzl, he was further inspired to join the ranks of the Zionist movement in 1896 and became a lifelong supporter of the Zionist movement upon the establishment of the World Zionist Organization at the First Zionist Congress in Basel in August 1897. From 1909 to the beginning of World War II Cohen directed the English department of the Zionist Central Office in Cologne and later in Berlin. During World War I he was interned in Ruhleben prison for sixteen months from November 1914. He described these experiences in Ruhleben Prison Camp: A Record of Nineteen Months’ Internment, which was published in 1917. In 1918 Cohen became secretary for the World Zionist Organization in London. During the years 1918-1921, he carried out a number of important diplomatic and fund-raising missions on behalf of the Zionist leadership. These took him to Poland and Hungary, where he investigated and reported on the recent surge in pogroms and other anti-Jewish acts of violence; and to Jewish communities in Australia, Hong Kong, India, China, and Japan. In Harbin, China, Cohen sought aid for the Palestine Restoration Fund, whose goal it was to purchase Palestine from Turkey. Cohen later described his encounters in The Journey of a Jewish Traveller (1925), and A Jewish Pilgrimage: The Autobiography of Israel Cohen (1956). Following the Zionist Congress of 1921, which took place in Karlsbad, Cohen was appointed general secretary of the Zionist organization in London, a position he held through 1939. He was also a member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and in 1946 he was appointed head of its Foreign Affairs Committee delegation to the peace conference in Paris. Cohen wrote prolifically on the subjects of Zionism, anti-Semitism, and other areas of Jewish concern. His first publication was an article that appeared in the Manchester Evening Chronicle in September 1897. This was followed by a short sketch that appeared in January 1898 in the Jewish World. He subsequently wrote hundreds of newspaper articles and pamphlets for both Jewish and non-Jewish publications alike. When working in Germany, Cohen became the Berlin correspondent for The Times and Manchester Guardian, and continued to represent the latter at every Zionist Congress up until 1946. Among his many book credits, in addition to the aforementioned titles, are: Israel in Italien (1909), Zionist Work in Palestine (1911), Jewish Life in Modern Times (1914), A Ghetto Gallery (1931), Britain’s Nameless Ally (1942), History of the Jews of Vilna (1943), The Jews in the War (1943), The Zionist Movement (1946), The Progress of Zionism (1947), and Theodore Herzl – Founder of Political Zionism (1959). Israel Cohen died in London on 26 November 1961."

  "text" : "Isaac of Ourville (Hebrew: יצחק מאורביל‎‎ Yiṣḥaq me-Orvil, fl. late 13th century) was a medieval French rabbi, author of the as yet unpublished Menahel, a book of halakha (Jewish ritual law). Isaac appears to have been a contemporary of Perez of Corbeil (died c. 1297); Isaac cites Moses of Coucy's Semag, from the generation before Perez, while segments of Isaac's Menahel are, in turn, cited alongside the Perez's teachings. His master was Hayyim of Blois, who is possibly identical with Hayyim ben Isaac the Frenchman (Hebrew: חיים בן יצחק הצרפתי‎‎), the author of Ez Hayyim on Jewish monetary law, a disciple of Samuel of Evreux. Carmoly and others read אורביל as \"Orbeil\", a village in the Puy-de-Dôme department, while Gross considered this unlikely, as Orbeil probably had no Jewish population in medieval times. According to Gross, אורביל is probably Ourville (Ourville-en-Caux), Seine-Maritime, or perhaps Orville, Orne. Isaac is thus sometimes named האורבלי HaOrvili (or HaOrbeli). He was confused by Samuel David Luzzato with a similarly named rabbinical authority, Isaac ben Dorbolo, after Rapoport's misinterpretation of the latter's patronymic as \"d'Orbolo\". Selections of his halakhic book, HaMenahel (Hebrew: המנהל‎‎ \"the Guide\"), were incorporated in the closely related pair of halakhic works, Orhot Hayyim by Aaron ben Jacob ha-Kohen and Kol Bo, and, anonymously, in the halakhic decisions of Menahem Recanati. Once considered lost, parts of the Menahel are now known to exist in manuscript."

Many of these also function as incense burners and candelabras. Peralta Soledad uses clay, enamel paints, adhesive and commercial decorations to create his pieces. The clay is modeled by hand, with the exception of faces and other small details, which are created with molds. He produces his works only by special order or for certain holidays such as Day of the Dead and Christmas, generally creating pieces for these events about two months before. Some of his creations can be found at the British Museum. In 2001, he was named a “grand master” by the Fomento Cultural Banamex."

  "text" : "Iosif Jumanca (December 23, 1893 – June 26, 1950) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian politician. Born in Fólya, Temes County, now Folea, Timiș County, in 1903 he became a founding member of the Romanian branch of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, which later became the Social Democratic Party of Transylvania and Banat. A journalist by profession, his political outlook encompassed both a strong patriotism on behalf of Austria-Hungary's Romanians and a commitment to social democracy. He was elected to the party leadership at three successive congresses: Nagyszeben (Sibiu) (December 1906), Budapest (December 1910) and Arad (October 1913). Although he viewed the socialist movement mainly in terms of struggle between classes rather than nationalities, Jumanca insisted on separate Romanian structures because he believed the many Romanian workers of Transylvania and Hungary were hesitant to join Hungarian-led political and trade movements for fear of Magyarization. He saw Romanian-led party sections and unions as a way to educate workers about their own language and history while safeguarding against Magyarization. Near the end of World War I, on October 30, 1918, a Romanian council was created in Budapest with the goal of preparing the union of Transylvania with Romania. This body had six representatives from the Romanian National Party and six social democrats, among whom was Jumanca. Moreover, he was present at the assembly in Alba Iulia that proclaimed the union, delivering a speech to the crowd of over 100,000 in which he emphasized the devotion to the national cause of the workers' movement. The following day, he was elected to the region's provisional parliament and named by the interim government as minister for industry. The subsequent period witnessed negotiations for uniting the socialist movement in Romania's new provinces with that of the Old Kingdom, a process that culminated with a congress held in October 1920 that absorbed the socialists of Transylvania, Banat and Bukovina into the Socialist Party of Romania. Eight individuals from these provinces were included in the party's leadership, Jumanca among them. Meanwhile, Ioan Flueraș traveled to Moscow to make contact with the Comintern; his experience there led social democrats to reject any ties with Soviet Russia. Thus, in February 1921, the social democrats of Transylvania, Banat and Bukovina withdrew from the pro-Moscow executive of the Socialist Party and formed a provisional leadership, to which Jumanca was elected. In May 1921, the socialist movement underwent a split at the founding conference of the Romanian Communist Party. The following month, a Federation of Romanian Socialist Parties was created by, among others, Jumanca, Flueraș, Gheorghe Grigorovici, Ilie Moscovici and Constantin-Titel Petrescu; this was consolidated at a congress in August 1922. In May 1927, the Federation reorganized into the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR), with Jumanca elected to its leadership. He continued to be elected to executive positions within the party at three subsequent congresses, in 1930, 1933 and 1936. Jumanca was among the social democrats elected to the Romanian Chamber of Deputies in 1928 and in 1931. Additionally, from 1932 to 1933, he was a member of the Cluj city council. In 1933, he was elected to the Senate, and he served until 1937. Although elected senator for Cluj County on November 29, it was not until the following February 1 that he was sworn in: the assassination of Ion G. Duca by the Iron Guard on December 29 seriously shook the political system. In the event, from the time he was seated until his term expired in November 1937, he was the only social democrat in the Romanian Parliament. In 1938, with the onset of the National Renaissance Front royal dictatorship of King Carol II, Jumanca was among those social democratic leaders who decided to work within the new system, hoping to improve the situation of the workers while aware of internal threats (the rise of the far-right) and external ones (irredentist demands that threatened to break up the country). Working within the country's social insurance department, neither he nor other social democrats practiced politics, but instead focused on helping the workers' guilds achieve their demands. Unlike Grigorovici, Jumanca had not held a position in Carol's government; neither had he been in the king's parliament, as had Flueraș; nor had he even considered cooperating with the Ion Antonescu dictatorship at its onset. These considerations led the individuals who recreated the PSDR after King Michael's Coup of August 23, 1944, to elect Jumanca to the party leadership. In contrast, Grigorovici, Flueraș, Lazăr Măglașu and Ilie Mirescu were excluded for their past collaboration. Jumanca was a close ally of Titel Petrescu, whom he followed into the Independent Social Democratic Party after a split between pro- and anti-communist social democrats in March 1946. Along with other party leaders, the two were arrested in February 1948 by the authorities of the new Communist Romania. According to witnesses mentioned by historian Stelian Neagoe, Jumanca was killed by torture at Gherla prison, his body then transported to Văcărești prison in Bucharest, in order to hide the evidence of the crime."

Ibn Fuladh, in order to gain Qazvin as his fief, revolted against the Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla in 1016. Majd al-Dawla, however, refused to make him governor of Qazvin, which made Ibn Fuladh threaten him around the countryside of his capital in Ray. Majd al-Dawla then requested the aid of his vassal, the Bavandid ruler Abu Ja'far Muhammad, who managed to defeat Ibn Fuladh and repel him from Ray. Ibn Fuladh then requested aid from the Ziyarid ruler Manuchihr, who was a rival of the Buyids. Ibn Fuladh agreed to become Manuchihr's vassal in return for his aid. The following year, a combined army of Ibn Fuladh and Manuchihr besieged Ray, which forced Majd al-Dawla to make Fuladh the governor of Isfahan. However, the Kakuyid ruler Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar, who was the original ruler of Isfahan, defeated Ibn Fuladh, and possibly killing him during the battle."

Not much is known about him; he traced his descent back to a family native to Isfahan. However, during the most of his lifetime he lived in Baghdad and in Khuzestan instead of his native city. During his early life, he was educated in science and sharia law. He later became the judge of Shustar and the head of the famous Al-'Adudi Hospital in Baghdad. Ibn Marzuban later died in 1006 at Shustar."

  "text" : "Isaac C. Phills, OC (January 11, 1896 – March 9, 1985) was a Canadian Steel Worker. Isaac Phills was awarded the Order of Canada in Canada's centennial year of 1967. Isaac's appointment was in the inaugural list of 90 and was the only person of African descent to be recognised in the first list. Phills was born in abject poverty in the West Indies before coming to Canada in 1916. He served in the First World War with the 85th Battalion (Nova Scotia Highlanders) of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. In Calvin Ruck's book, \"The Black Battalion 1916-1920, Canada's Best Kept Military Secret,\" Phills was quoted, saying, \"In Sydney after the war started, quite a few Blacks volunteered for active service and were told point blank, 'We don't want you. This is a white man's war.' However, in 1917, the Canadian Army was up against it. They had lost a lot of men in France. At that point, they were willing to take anyone. Conscription came in, and they took the Blacks and the Whites.\" Returning to Sydney, Nova Scotia after his discharge from service he went back to work at Sydney Steel where he continued to work for 45 years and raised a family that included four college graduates. Phills was active in his community, a member and vestryman of Saint Alban's Anglican Church in Whitney Pier, treasurer of the Ethiopian Community Club and secretary of the Court Washington Ancient Order of Foresters. The first black man to receive the Order of Canada, he is important for the role he played in showing the immigrant community of Whitney Pier that any man could overcome hardship through hard work and determination and build a prosperous life for themselves and their family in a new land. Phills' Order of Canada citation reads in part, \"A Cape Breton steel worker of West Indian origin, who raised a large family and despite many difficulties, gave them a good education and start in life and set a fine example in the community.\""

  "text" : "Ida Rauh (March 7, 1877 – February 28, 1970) was a lawyer, suffragist, actress, sculptor, and poet who helped found the Provincetown Players in 1915. The players, including Susan Glaspell, George Cram Cook, John Reed, Hutchins Hapgood, Eugene O'Neill, and others, first performed in a structure owned by Mary Heaton Vorse in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Later, the group moved to a theater on MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. In Provincetown, Rauh directed the first production of O'Neill's one-act play \"Where the Cross Is Made\", and in the Village she became known for her intensely emotional acting. Rauh graduated from the New York University law school in 1902, \"with little hope of practicing law, so closed was the profession to her sex.\" She became involved with the Women's Trade Union League, including efforts to assist in the shirtwaist-makers strike in New York in 1909. Soon after, she traveled to England to join other militant women in the fight for women's suffrage. Returning to New York, she helped Mabel Dodge organize her Village salon and became active in the feminist group Heterodoxy, formed in 1912. After her marriage to writer and editor Max Eastman in New York in 1911, Rauh made a point of keeping her maiden name. In some places, such as Eastman's home town of Elmira, this was considered scandalous, the \"first step on a slippery slope that led to feckless wives of loose morals, easy divorce, and free love\". Eastman, who edited the left-wing journals The Masses and The Liberator with the help of his older sister Crystal in the second decade of the 20th century, credited Rauh with introducing him to socialism. During her years in Greenwich Village, Rauh supported a variety of feminist causes, among them Margaret Sanger's campaigns. Arrested in 1916 for distributing birth-control information, Rauh was charged with obscenity and given a suspended sentence. Rauh left the theater in 1920 to pursue sculpture, painting, and other interests. Among her works is a bust of writer D. H. Lawrence, who was one of her friends. A book of her poems, And This Little Life, was published in 1959. Her collected papers, including poems, television scripts, stage plays, correspondence, and other materials are housed in the American Heritage Center of the University of Wyoming in Laramie."

She founded Axis Danse with Christina Coleman in 1977, and in 1980, Tembeck became a professor in the Dance Department at Université du Québec à Montréal, where she also co-founded the choreographic research group Artscene.Tembeck signed over 40 choreographic works, which were produced with Le Groupe Nouvelle Aire (L'Attente, 1976; Howl, 1976; Incubus, 1977), Axis Danse (amongst them, Terracotta, 1980; Amazonie, 1983; Kyklos, 1983), Les Ballets Jazz de Montréal (Germinal, 1984; Numbers, 1987), and Les Ballets Eddy Toussaint (Cool Heure Blues, 1988). Tembeck's academic research investigated the roots of contemporary Quebec dance. Her book Dancing in Montreal: Seeds of a Choreographic History, originally published in French in 1991, was the first to retrace the twentieth-century history of dance in Montreal. It was named \"Outstanding Publication in Dance Research\" by the Congress on Research in Dance in 1996. Described as \"a force in researching and recording dance history,\" Tembeck was considered \"one of the foremost experts in the field.\" Her publications are used as textbooks for courses on the history of dance in Quebec."

  "text" : "Ivaan Kotulsky was an artist and photographer, living and working in Toronto, Canada.According to an interview with his widow, Eya Donald Greenland Kotulsky, he was born in a Nazi slave labour camp, during World War II.Kotulsky had a distinguished career as a photographer, producing portraits of high-profile individuals, like Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Kotulsky also documented the lives of street people, and that collection of photos has been donated to the City of Toronto archives, which organized a gallery show, to celebrate their acquisition, and subsequently made them available for download. Kotulsky was born to Maria and Mykyta Kotulsky while his family was interned in a Nazi slave labour camp near Koln, Germany, in the final months of World War II, during an Allied bombing raid. In 1949, after having lived for four years as refugees in a Displaced Persons' camp, his family immigrated to Canada, sponsored by a blacksmith in Smoky Lake, Alberta. By 1951, his family had relocated to Toronto's Cabbagetown, near the Don Valley ravine, which provided a slice of nature in downtown Toronto for Ivaan to explore. Kotulsky would later credit his exposure to the kindly blacksmith as having kindled his own interest in metalworking which found its outlet in jewellery making, at the age of 25. Kotulsky was said to have been able to see beauty in things people ordinarily overlook, explaining the quality of the intimate images he took of street people. The engagement ring with which he proposed to his wife featured a very large green stone—which was originally a discarded piece of Seven Up bottle. Never in robust health, Ivaan suffered two heart attacks in the early 1990s. In 1995, Kotulsky opened a retail store on Queen Street West. That year, he and Eya Donald Greenland were married. They had first met in 1969; she was 16 and working after school at the Harbord Bakery, which he frequented. In 2000, Kotulsky experienced the first of a series of strokes that eventually led to his paralysis and affected his ability to create new works of art. In 2005, after his third stroke, when he lacked the strength and dexterity to continue working independently, Eya started to assist him in his studio, often working with his original moulds, using the lost wax casting technique. She told Nicole Baute, writing in the Toronto Star, that she never intended to continue making pieces from those moulds after he died, beyond filling the outstanding orders, but customers continued to request pieces. The Art Gallery of Ontario, which had commissioned Kotulsky in 1979 to create a collection of jewellery and metal art inspired by King Tut, hosted a long-running exhibition of King Tut artefacts in 2009, and requested she produce additional reproductions of his work for display in the AGO Shop. Ivaan's wife, Eya, continues to operate his studio, Atelier Ivaan, to showcase and preserve his artistic legacy. Baute reported that Kotulsky became the \"first Canadian to undergo a pioneering neurosurgical procedure\", to close off the damaged artery that had led to his four strokes.She reported that the surgery closed off the artery, but that Kotulsky suffered a fifth stroke during surgery, that left him in a coma from which he never regained consciousness. Ivaan Kotulsky died on December 6, 2008."

  "text" : "Ibrahim Jadhran (born 1981), is a Libyan militia leader from Ajdabiya in eastern Libya. He participated as a rebel commander in the 2011 Libyan revolution. In 2012, after the revolution, Jadhran was named a commander of the Petroleum Defense Guards, the government force protecting the national oil facilities. Jadhran became dissatisfied with the actions of the central government, accusing it of corruption and incompetence, and demanded more autonomy for the eastern provinces that hold the rich oil fields. He declared that he opposes the Muslim Brotherhood that holds the central power in Tripoli, while detractors tried to link him to jihadists. He favors a federal relationship of the various provinces of Libya, where provinces would control their own resources, and the central government manages the military and foreign affairs. In 2013, Jadhran set up the Cyrenaica Political Bureau and secured control of eastern ports, namely Sidra, Ras Lanuf and Zueitina. In August 2013, Jathran issued the “Ras Lanuf Declaration”, the declaration asks for the right to “govern our own affairs”. By October 2013, Jathran’s militia, the Cyrenaica Self-Defense Force, was estimated to number 17,500 men. In 2014, Jadhran attempted to sell oil excluding the central government. The MV Morning Glory was loaded with crude oil at Sidra and broke through a weak government blockade. As a result, Ali Zeidan, the Prime Minister of Libya, was ousted by the parliament led by a Muslim Brotherhood coalition. However, Jathran’s success was short-lived. The US Ambassador, Deborah K. Jones declared Jadhran’s actions to be a “theft from the Libyan people.”  At the behest of the Libyan government, US forces took control of the ship on March 16, 2014, making it unlikely that Jadhran can sell oil without the permission of the central government."

By using historical methods and original instruments, Elias has been able to recreate a musical language of the Baroque, Classic and Romantic periods. The Prince Bernard Cultural Foundation made it possible for Izhar to own a 1812 unique Guadagnini guitar. His collaboration with composers, choreographers and film makers has led to over 30 premieres and different multimedia projects. In 2014 Izhar was the feature of a documentary, where he played a classical piece written by death metal guitarist Florian Magnus Maier."

  "text" : "For the rugby player from New Zealand, see Isaac Ross. Isaac Ross (1760-1836) was an American Revolutionary War veteran and planter from South Carolina who developed Prospect Hill Plantation in Jefferson County, Mississippi, for cotton cultivation. He owned thousands of acres and nearly 160 slaves by 1820. In 1830 Ross was among the major donors and founders of Oakland College, a Presbyterian-affiliated school for young men near Lorman, Mississippi, which operated from 1830 to 1870. After sale to the state that year, it was renamed by the state legislature as Alcorn College and designated as a land-grant university, the first land grant institution for blacks in the United States. Influenced by war ideals and the American Colonization Society, Ross was among the founders of the Mississippi Colonization Society. Its goal was to repatriate (or transport) freed slaves to Africa in order to get them out of the South, where planters believed they threatened slave societies. In 1835 Ross wrote a will to free his hundreds of African-American slaves (who were overwhelmingly US native-born) and sell his plantation, using the revenue to transport the freed slaves to Liberia, where a colony had been set up in coastal West Africa. The Mississippi Colonization Society purchased land, establishing a colony known as Mississippi-in-Africa. In 1847 it became part of the Commonwealth of Liberia."

  "text" : "Ismāʿīl Bey (c. 1735? - March 1791), also known as Ismail Bey al-Kabir (\"the Great\") was a Mamluk emir and regent of Ottoman Egypt. Ismail was supposedly of Georgian origin and became a Mamluk of the Emir Ali Bey al-Kabir in Egypt. During the Russo-Turkish War Ali Bey used the opportunity to declare Egypt's independence from the Ottoman empire. On Ali's behalf Ismail Bey suppressed a pro-Ottoman revolt in Lower Egypt (1768). Acting on Ali's orders he also invaded Hidjaz and subdued all of its ports and coastal towns north of Djidda (1770). When Ali Bey's most trusted general (and brother-in-law) Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dhahab betrayed him and marched against Cairo, Ismail Bey was sent out to intercept him but was forced to surrender and to submit (1772). After Abu Dhahab's death (1775) Ismail Bey rallied the remaining mamluks of Ali Bey but failed to prevent Abu Dhahabs comrades Ibrahim Bey and Murad Bey from succeeding him. Murad tried to poison him, however, Ismail and the Ali-Bey-faction (Alawiyya) managed to expel the Abu-Dhahab-faction (Muhammadiyya) from Cairo to Upper Egypt (1777). A few months later several Alawiyya-emirs changed sides. Ibrahim and Murad came back and forced Ismail to flee (1778). \n* Mentor: Ali Bey \n* Rival: Abu Dhahab \n* Enemy: Murad Bey \n* Ally: Hasan Pasha Following the intervention of the Ottoman admiral Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha in 1786 Ismail Bey returned to Egypt and was installed as Shaykh al-Balad (civil governor and de facto ruler) while Ibrahim and Murad escaped to Upper Egypt again. Due to another Russo-Turkish War the Ottoman Empire withdrew the Turkish troops the next year. Ismail Bey asked the French consul whether France could send military instructors and training units. However, the French revolution made this impossible. Ismail Bey and almost the whole of his faction was wiped out because of the plague. After the Ismailiyya-regime collapsed, Ibrahim and Murad returned and took over the power again. Murad decided to reside in Ismail's palace."
