He studied medicine in Paris, and worked in the laboratories at the Hospice de Bicêtre and the Salpêtrière. In 1894 he received his doctorate in medicine. In Paris, he was an assistant to neurologist Joseph Jules Dejerine, with whom he collaborated on a number of studies, the best known being the eponymous \"Dejerine-Sottas syndrome\". The following are a list of various medical papers published by Dejerine and Sottas: \n*  Sur un cas de syringomyélie unilatérale et à début tardif suivi d'autopsie, 1892 - A case of unilateral syringomyelia with a late onset. \n*  Sur un cas de cécité corticale diagnostiquée pendant la vie et confirmée par l'autopsie, 1893 - A case of cortical blindness diagnosed during life and confirmed by autopsy.  \n*  Sur un cas de maladie de Thomsen suivi d'autopsie, 1895 - A case involving Thomsen disease. \n*  Sur la névrite interstitielle, hypertrophique et progressive de l'enfance, 1893 - On interstitial hypertrophic progressive childhood neuritis, (Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy described).  \n*  Note sur un cas de paraplégie spasmodique acquise, par sclérose primitive des cordons latéraux, 1895 - On a case of acquired spastic paraplegia with primary sclerosis of the lateral columns. \n*  Sur un cas de dégénerescence ascendante dans les cordons antérieurs et latéraux de la moelle, 1895 - A case of ascending degeneration in the anterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord  \n*  Sur la distribution des fibres endogènes dans le cordon postérieur de la moelle et sur la constitution du cordon de Goll, 1895 - On the distribution of endogenous fibers in the posterior column of the spinal cord and on the constitution of the column of Goll. Among his solo efforts, he published a study on syphilytic spinal paralysis, titled Contribution à l’étude anatomique et clinique des paralysies spinales syphilitiques (1894). In addition to his neurological research, Sottas was the author of several works with historical themes, the following being a few of his better known writings in this field: \n*  Histoire de la Compagnie royale des Indes orientales, 1664-1719, 1905 - History of the Royal East India Company. \n*  L'astrolabe-quadrant du Musée des antiquités de Rouen, 1910 - The Astrolabe Quadrant at the Museum of Antiquities in Rouen.  \n*  Les messageries maritimes de Venise aux XIVe & XVe siècles, 1938 - Messageries Maritimes of Venice in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries."

  "text" : "Jacques Pugin (born May 20, 1954 in Riaz, Switzerland) is an artist-photographer. He is one of the precursors of the Light Painting technique, which consists in capturing luminous traces during the photographic process, either via direct exposure of the sensor to the light source, or else to a lit subject. Jacques constructs his images by intervening either in the actual capturing process (incamera) or in post-production, using various techniques, such as drawing, painting or digital tools. If the subject of his early work was the Body, since then he primarily photographs Nature. A feature of Jacques Pugin's work is his particular focus on traces or signs, that indicate the presence of human or natural elements in the landscape. His photographs are a reflection on time, space and the complex relation between man and nature."

In 1959, at System Development Corporation Cogswell pioneered the first study in computer-assisted counseling. In 1965, caught between the \"objective\" psychologist and the subjective self, he sought therapy with James Bugental. This therapy produced a transpersonal experience that markedly altered his view of reality. Since 1968 he has pursued meditation, Vajrayana Buddhism, Jungian theory and Bioenergetic therapy. Through 1982-2002 he trained with Tibetan lamas and took his Bodhisattva vows with the Venerable Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche.

Gordon also participated in the transatlantic slave trade but was not a major importer of captive Africans. John Gordon did business in Charles Town and Savannah, as well as in British East Florida. The regional network of Scottish traders headed by Gordon in Charles Town, and the brothers John and James Graham in Savannah, served as a liaison between government officials(many of them fellow Scots to whom they were connected politically) and the Indian tribes, primarily the Creeks.Gordon also underwrote the mercantile activities of George Galphin, the wealthiest Indian trader in the Southeast, whose trading firm was predominant in the tribal towns of the Chattahoochee Valley and in Coweta."

  "text" : "John Richard Buckland (3 August 1819 – 13 October 1874), was an Australian school teacher and first headmaster of The Hutchins School, Tasmania. Buckland was the son of the Rev. John Buckland, Rector of Templeton, Devonshire, and a nephew of Dr. William Buckland, Dean of Westminster. He received his early education from his father at Laleham, and was then sent to Rugby School, of which school his uncle, Dr. Arnold, was at the time head master. At the age of seventeen he went to the University of Oxford, where he held a studentship at Christ Church. After taking his degree Buckland determined to emigrate to the colonies, and sailed for New Zealand, but in consequence of the unsettled state of affairs in that colony he removed to Tasmania, arriving in Hobart in February 1843. He was for a time second master of the Queen's School, of which the Rev. John Philip Gell was head master. On the closing of that school he opened a private school. In 1845 he was ordained. In 1846 the prospectus of a Church of England Grammar School was issued, and on 3 August in that year the school, named \"The Hutchins School\" in memory of Archdeacon William Hutchins, was opened at Hobart, with Buckland as head master. It soon became one of the leading schools of the colony, a position which it has ever since maintained, a large number of the most prominent men of Tasmania having received their education at the Hutchins School. Buckland held the post of headmaster for twenty-eight years, until his death, which took place at Hobart on 13 October 1874."

  "text" : "Jacques de Menasce (August 19, 1905 – January 28, 1960) was a composer, pianist, and critic of Austrian, and later American, nationality. Jacques de Menasce was born in Bad Ischl into a Jewish family with roots in Egypt where they had amassed considerable wealth as merchants and bankers and played prominent roles in the Jewish community that centred in Alexandria. This was also the family from which sprang the Catholic writer Jean de Menasce, who was a first cousin of the composer's father, Henri de Menasce. As a boy Jacques de Menasce's portrait was painted by Oskar Kokoschka. He studied at the Vienna Music Academy as a young man under teachers who included Joseph Marx, Paul Pisk, and Emil von Sauer, and he was also much encouraged by Alban Berg, at whose instigation he composed his first piano concerto. His compositions include two piano concertos, the Sonata for Viola and Piano (championed by Lillian Fuchs), Hebrew Melodies for Violin and Piano, and the song cycles Quatre Chansons, Outrenuit, and Pour une Princesse. There exist a few recordings of his works. The first, on Vanguard Classics, contains performances of the second piano concerto along with his Divertimento on a Children's Song and the Petite Suite pour le Piano. The conductor is the composer's friend Edmond Appia and the pianist is the composer himself. There is also a recording issued by Composers Recordings, Inc. (CRI) that contains performances of the viola sonata, the second sonatina for piano, the first violin sonata, and Instantanés, a collection of short piano pieces. His Deux Lettres d'Enfants appears on a Nimbus recording of Hugues Cuénod singing French song cycles. There also exists a recording of Jacques de Menasce participating (together with the violinist Ángel Reyes) in a performance of the Sonatine for violin and piano of Henry Barraud."

His early research involved studies of protozoa, and following post-doctoral work in Berlin, he became a curator at the natural history museum in Basel. Here, he performed analysis of herpetological specimens collected by Fritz Müller, his predecessor at Basel. In 1907-08, with Hugo Merton, he performed scientific research in the Aru and Kei Islands, and in 1911-12, with Fritz Sarasin, he visited New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands. As a result of the latter expedition, he published with Sarasin a major work titled, Nova Caledonia. Forschungen in Neu-Caledonien und auf den Loyalty-Inseln. Recherches scientifiques en Nouvelle-Calédonie et aux iles Loyalty. During his career, he was the author of 35 papers on herpetological subjects."

  "text" : "Johann Erker (1781 – October 18, 1809) was an Austrian rebel leader against the French occupation of the region during the War of the Fifth Coalition in the 1809 Gottscheer Rebellion. Erker was a Gottscheer, who were ethnic Germans descended from 14th century Tyrolean and Carinthian settlers to the then uninhabited Gottschee region. According to the parish death records, Erker was 28 years old when he died, and lived in Windischdorf #12. It is unknown if he ever served in the Austrian military, however he was almost certainly in the local Landwehr battalions raised by the Austrian government in 1808. During the 1809 campaign, a Gottscheer Battalion was stationed on the Italian front and after Austria's military collapse they returned to their home region. When the French advanced into Carniola and towards Gottschee in July, 900 Gottscheer Landwehr soldiers assembled to resist the advance. They were quickly dispersed by the French columns, however it would be very likely that Johann Erker was one of those men. He may also have played a role in the riots of September 10 in the city square, where the French district commissioner resorted to calling in a battalion to disband the 600 rioters trapping him in the city. On October 7, 1809, Gottscheer and some Slovene people in the border regions south of Gottschee attacked French troops who were in the villages collecting taxes. By the night of October 8, word of this had reached the northern Gottscheer villages such as Windischdorf and Erker assumed command of the local men. Under his command, they joined in the assault on Gottschee City the following morning and attacked the French garrison. Numbering no more than 100 men, the French troops (from Napoleon's Italian regiments) fell back to the castle in the town square and were besieged all morning in the castle. Finally, the Gottscheers broke through the gates, and massacred most of the garrison. Commissioner Gasparini was one of the killed, dragged out through the streets and butchered by the angry rebel mob. After this battle, and during it for that matter, Erker's actions are unknown. From October 9 to October 14, the rebel Gottscheer forces drove French troops out of the Gottschee region and laid siege to the city of Neustadtl to the north. Erker may have led the troops in this siege, or he led the Gottscheer defenses against the French troops as they tried to force their way in at Schweinberg. In Neustadtl, the rebels were driven off thanks to the arrival of reinforcements under General Carlo Zucchi, the bravery and quick thinking of defending commander Captain Luigi Tarducci, and their own ineptitude. At Schweinberg, 100 French soldiers tried to dislodge an unknown number of rebels (though probably not much more than 100) from their formidable defenses. That battle ended after several hours of fighting with the French withdrawal after their commanding officer was cut down by Gottscheer fire. On October 15, Johann Erker was inside the city of Gottschee when the French relief force of 1,000 led by General Zucchi approached from the southeast. After a brief exchange of gunfire, the French troops advanced towards the town as the defense collapsed. Rebels fled the city and its vicinity as Zucchi's troops entered. Some stayed, and surely there was sporadic fighting and prisoners were taken. Erker was arrested here, along with Bartholomäus Kusold, Matthias Stalzer, Georg Eisenzopf, Johann Jonke, and many other Gottscheer rebels. The five named men were indicated as rebel leaders. After three days of looting the city, Zucchi ordered the leaders executed. On the morning of October 18, 1809, a nine-man firing squad was organized facing the side of the parish church dedicated to St. Bartholomew, and one by one the rebel leaders were led out to die. Their order of death is not known, but regardless of the order Johann Erker of Windischdorf was killed on that morning against the wall of the parish church."

D'Aquino is best known for his 'Matchbook Miniatures' which are meticulously hyper detailed small scale pencil drawings, not exceeding one inch by one inch in dimension, carefully crafted onto the inside cover of vintage strike-on-front matchbooks. D'Aquino's illustrations visit themes of evil, cruelty, madness, and loss of innocence. These motifs derive themselves from his passion for mystery and macabre : his greatest influences being H. P. Lovecraft, Edward Gorey, Hans Bellmer, Maurice Sendak, and serial killers such as Ed Gein and sundry other real-life monsters and deviants of true crime."

Burns was born in the north of Ireland, and emigrated to New South Wales at an early age. In 1854 he had married Lucy Maria Smith at Maitland. Having engaged in mercantile pursuits in the Hunter River district, Burns was returned to the Assembly for the Hunter in 1862, and represented the constituency for many years. He was one of the members for St. Leonard's 1889 to 1891. He was Postmaster-General in the John Robertson Ministry from February 1875 to March 1877, and in that of James Farnell from December 1877 to December 1878. He introduced postal cards into Australia in 1875, and was the first to give employment to women in the telegraph department. In 1878 he arranged with the Governments of the other Australian colonies and New Zealand for the duplication of the submarine cable to Australia. Burns was Treasurer in the last Robertson Ministry from December 1885 to February 1886, and in that of Sir Henry Parkes from January 1887 to January 1889. He was gazetted a C.M.G. in 1887, but declined the honour, and the appointment was cancelled. Burns died in Paddington, New South Wales on 19 March 1911; four sons and two daughters survived him."

  "text" : "John B. Michel (1917–1969) was a science fiction author (sometimes publishing under the name Hugh Raymond) and editor associated with the Futurians, of which he was one of twelve founding members. He was elected Director of the Futurians in 1941. He was widely known for his Left-wing, utopian politics, which came to be known in SF fandom as \"Michelism,\" or the belief that \"science-fiction should by nature stand for all forces working for a more unified world, a more Utopian existence, the application of science to human happiness, and a saner outlook on life.\" Debates over Michelism and its association with Technocracy and Communism were an object of controversy in fanzines in the late 1930s, and its influence can be seen in much science fiction of the period, including Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. Michel was a member of the Young Communist League, and later joined the CPUSA, although he was asked to leave in 1949 for absenteeism. In the early 1940s, Michel was briefly romantically associated with Judith Merril."

  "text" : "Josefa Loazia, also more commonly known as \"Juanita\", was a Mexican-American woman who was executed by hanging in Downieville, California on July 5, 1851. She was found guilty of murdering a man, Frederick Cannon, who attempted to assault her. She is known to be the first and only woman to be hanged in California. Many discrepancies exist regarding the circumstances of her death. Josefa’s death has many connections and relevancy to the larger history of Latina/os in the United States because it shows how her racial status affected perception of her and how devalued the life of a Mexican American woman was. Josefa’s death highlights the discrimination and violence against Latinos in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Upon the end of the Mexican-American War, the discovery of gold in California, and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, life for Mexicans in what had become the United States was changed completely. They lost their property, political power, and their culture was deemed worthless  They became segregated and did not have opportunities for advancement. This discrimination affected and applied to both rich and poor Mexicans. In Anglo journals and other media, Mexican women were depicted as flashy and morally deviant “sirens”. This is apparent in how Josefa’s story was presented in Anglo media. She was known as “Juanita” when stories came out about her death in complete disregard of who she was so much as to give her a stereotypical name for a Mexican woman rather than using her real name."

  "text" : "James Calvert (3 January 1813 – 8 March 1892), was a Methodist missionary. James Calvert was a native of Pickering, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. He was sent out in 1838, in company with John Hunt, to labour amongst the cannibals in Fiji, where he remained for eighteen years, during which time he witnessed marvellous triumphs of Christianity. In his labours among the Fijians he was ably assisted by his heroic wife, Mary Fowler Calvert, who was in every way a model missionary's wife, and much of the wonderful success of those years was due to her patient, self-denying labours. By Calvert's ministry the Fijian King Seru Epenisa Cakobau was converted to Christianity, renounced polygamy, and for many years after lived a consistent life. His last act as a king was to cede Fiji to Great Britain. In 1856 Calvert returned to England, and during his stay in the country superintended the printing of the entire Scriptures in the Fijian language. In 1872 he was sent out by the Wesleyan Missionary Society to South Africa. He died at Hastings, England, in 1892 aged seventy-nine. In that year he founded a Wesleyan chapel in Hastings; after his death it was named the Calvert Memorial Chapel."

  "text" : "James Henry Bennet (1816–1891) was an English doctor who helped popularize the French Riviera as a Winter holiday destination in the 19th century with his 1861 book Winter and Spring on the Shores of the Mediterranean. Bennet has been described by the Menton Tourist Board as the \"Inventor of the Menton resort\". Bennet studied medicine in Paris, and after working as a doctor for 25 years contracted tuberculosis. Bennet went to the small coastal village of Menton in the South of France, close to the Italian border in 1859, wanting to \"...die in a quiet corner, like a wounded denizen of the forest\". Bennet's health greatly improved, and visited Italy the next year, but found the \"unhygienic state of the large towns of that classical land undid the good previously obtained\". He returned to Menton and started a medical practice, and completely healed, returned to England in the Summer to see his patients. His routine would be to spend Winter in Menton, and take a holiday in April and May, to study the Mediterranean climate and vegetation, traveling to Genoa, in Italy, before returning to England in the Summer. Menton was connected by rail to Paris in 1869, which greatly increased the Alpes-Maritimes popularity as a destination for visitors. The construction of a rail link in 1861 between Nice and Ventimiglia, in Italy, meant that the coastal road could be avoided, which had previously been subjected to dangerous mudslides. Bennet still advised his patients to come to Menton by road to \"enjoy the wonderful spectacle.\" At the foothills of the Alps, Menton was sheltered from the winds, cold and heavy rain that characterised the regions weather. Enjoying a winter in mild weather provided a psychological boost for Bennet's patients, he wrote that they were \"so charmed by the sun, the spectacle of nature and vegetation, they almost forgot their troubles.\" Bennet described the attractions of Menton and the South of France to his patients, finding that invoking the \"...beauties of nature, the magnificence of the sun ...the intoxication of the ever-changing sea, they were able to face the long and difficult journey to the south\". Bennet felt that the hot and dry climate of the French Riviera as well as a proper diet cured tuberculosis sufferers. With the publication of Bennet's books, Menton's popularity as a destination greatly increased. His books were translated into German, and published in the United States. From \"two or three hotels\" in Menton in 1861, over 30 hotels had been built by 1875. Notable patients of Bennet's included Robert Louis Stevenson and Queen Victoria.Bennet bought a ruined tower with land on the hills above Menton, creating an eight-acre garden. He would also travel to San Remo and Marseille to meet experts in horticulture. Bennet's garden was even visited by Queen Victoria and her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice. A street, Rue J.H. Bennet is named after Bennet in Menton, and a monument was erected to Bennett in Menton's Rue Partouneaux."

  "text" : "John Hutchinson (1811–1861) invented the spirometer, a device for measuring lung capacity. He used this device in evaluating candidates for life insurance while working as a physician to the Brittania Life office.  He also theorized that air pollution could lead to poor health. Particularly, he researched the safety of coal mining and the presence of charcoal in miner's lungs. He moved to Australia around 1852, and then later to Fiji where he died as a result of contracting dysentery."

El País correspondent Juan Jesús Aznárez described Ibarz as \"the journalist who knows the most about Latin America.\" Also described as \"a defender of democracy and a staunch critic of the populist and authoritarian regimes in Latin America,\" Ibarz was present at the 1992 Fujimori coup in Peru, the 1994 Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, and other major events in modern Latin American history. In 1991, owing to his coverage of the regime of Fidel Castro, he became the first Spaniard to be expelled from Cuba. He later recalled that after the fall of the Soviet Union, Cubans \"were so desperate that they were eating the island's cats,\" and said that no story he had ever written had \"raised such a ruckus\" as the 1992 article in which he \"confirmed the sad fate of Cuban cats\" by asking 300 or so Cubans if they had eaten cat. \"About a third said yes.\" In addition to being expelled from Cuba, he was accused by Hugo Chávez of being \"responsible for the political agitations against the Bolivarian caudillo.\""

From 1960 to 1962, as a post-doctoral researcher, he was at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton (and again from 1965 to 1966). In 1962 he was assistant professor and since 1966 he has been professor at Berkeley. Wolf considers applications of group theory to differential geometry and complex manifolds and applications of harmonic analysis to the theory of elementary particles and control theory. In 1994 he received the Humboldt Research Award and in 1977 the Medal of the University of Liège. In 1989 he received an honorary professorship at the National University of Cordoba in Argentina. From 1972 to 1973 and from 1983 to 1984, he was professor Miller in Berkeley. He is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society and member of the Swiss Mathematical Society. From 1965 to 1967 he was a Sloan Fellow. He held a Miller Research Professorship twice, in the 1972-73 and 1983-84 academic years."

  "text" : "James Joseph Casey (25 December 1831 – 5 April 1913) was a politician in colonial Victoria (Australia), a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly almost continuously from 1861 to 1880, County Court Judge and Land Tax Commissioner, Victoria. Casey was born in Tromroe, County Clare, Ireland, the son of James Casey. He was educated at Galway College, and after five years spent in America he arrived in Victoria in 1855, where he joined Angus Mackay in the purchase of the Bendigo Advertiser, and afterwards started the McIvor Times and Riverine Herald. In August 1861 Casey was elected to the Assembly for Sandhurst, but was unseated on petition in March 1862. After being unsuccessful for Grenville  in 1862, in August 1863 he was returned for Mandurang in the Liberal interest, and continued to sit for that constituency until February 1880. In September 1865 he was called to the Victorian bar, and practised with success, being from time to time Crown Prosecutor. From July 1868 to September 1869 he was Minister of Justice in the second James McCulloch Administration, exchanging this office for that of Solicitor-General about a fortnight before the defeat of the Government. The next year Casey was appointed Chairman of a Royal Commission on Intercolonial Legislation and a Court of Appeal. In June 1872 he became Minister of Lands and Minister of Agriculture under James Francis, and held office till August 1875—for the last twelve months of the time under George Kerferd, who succeeded Francis as Premier. Whilst at the head of the Lands Office Casey reorganised the department, and constituted the survey branch on an effective basis. He also checked the system of \"dummyism\" by instituting inquiries, and subsequently forfeiting the runs and improvements of the incriminated squatters. In 1878 he was appointed Executive Commissioner for Victoria at the Paris Exhibition, and was created C.M.G. for his services, being also nominated an Officer of the Legion of Honour by the French Government. The Victorian Hansard was established on his motion, and, when in office, he introduced the system of appointing magistrates to districts instead of for the whole colony. The jurisdiction of the County Courts was, on his initiation, increased from £50 to £250 at common law, and an equitable jurisdiction was conferred on them up to £500. Though still claiming to be a Liberal, Casey assumed an independent attitude towards the second Graham Berry Ministry from 1877 to 1880, and was in consequence ejected from his seat at Mandurang at the general election in the latter year. Casey did not re-enter parliament, though he unsuccessfully contested Sandridge (now Port Melbourne) in 1883. Casey, who was the first President of the Federal Bank of Australia, was Executive Vice-President of the Melbourne International Exhibition (1880), and in that capacity, and as Chairman of the Great Britain Committee, contributed much to its success. In April 1884 Casey, who is the author of \"Casey's Justices' Manual,\" was appointed a County Court Judge; and in July 1885 he assumed the additional functions of a Land Tax Commissioner, being for a short time in that year an Acting Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Casey married Maria Teresa, daughter of John Cahill and Mary McNamara his wife, of Bendigo; there were no children. Casey died in St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia, on 5 April 1913."

  "text" : "Jean Carle CVO (born 16 July 1962) is a Canadian former civil servant, business executive and Liberal Party operative noted for his close relationship with former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. Carle was described by Maclean's in 1998 as being so close to Chrétien as to be almost a member of the Chrétien family. Carle was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the son of Robert and Gervaise (née Loignon) and was educated successively at Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, Collège André-Grasset and the Université de Montréal. Carle served one of the vice-presidents of the Liberal Party in 1983-84, as president of the Quebec wing of the Young Liberals in 1984-85 and as an aide to Chrétien between 1984-1986. In 1984, Carle had supported John Turner against Chrétien, but when Chrétien asked him at a meeting why he had supported an Anglo against a fellow Québécois, leading a guilt-stricken Carle to defect over to the Chrétien camp. Chrétien soon grew fond of Carle, and hired him on as an assistant. On February 27, 1986, Carle attended the meeting between Chrétien and John Turner when Chrétien resigned, leading Carle to break down in tears. Starting in 1986, Carle worked as a public affairs consultant with MediaProfile, and served as the public affairs director for BCP Advertising between 1987-89. When Carle was short of money in the 1980s, Chrétien allowed Carle to live rent-free in his basement at his Ottawa house. On 7 October 1989, he married Marie Elizabeth Thorne and has two children. Starting in 1990, Carle resumed his career as Chrétien's special executive assistant following his patron's return to politics when he became leader of the Liberal Party. Carle was so close to Chrétien that he was widely seen within the Liberal Party as Chrétien's \"surrogate son\". When Chrétien became prime minister, he appointed Carle to be his director of operations at the Prime Minister's Office, a post that Carle held until he retired from the PMO in February 1998. As the director of operations at the PMO Carle was described as very efficient to the point that one Liberal complained that Carle gave the impression that he was working in a dictatorship rather than a democracy. In 1997, Carle was named Commander of the Victorian Order by Elizabeth II. During his time at the PMO, Carle was responsible for organizing the security for the November 1997 APEC summit in Vancouver that saw the RCMP crush demonstrators protesting against human rights abuses in China and Indonesia. On 7 August 2001, a report was issued by Judge Ted Hughes, which cleared Chrétien of wrongdoing at the APEC summit, but stated that Carle had improperly pressured the RCMP to attack the protesters. Judge Hughes accused Carle of \"throwing his weight around\" and attempting to interfere with security arrangements. Hughes concluded that the RCMP had used excessive force that was in violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. After leaving the PMO in 1998, Carle took up a post as vice-president responsible for corporate affairs at the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDBC). Patrick Lavelle, the chairman of the Business Development Bank, tried to block Carle's appointment on the grounds that he was unsuitable for the post, but after a meeting with Carle's patron Chrétien, felt he had \"no choice\", but to accept Carle. Carle played a role in the Sponsorship scandal. Carle admitted to the Gomery Commission in 2005 that he had created a $125, 000 phoney paper trail to hide a sponsorship deal while at the BDBC. Carle transferred money from the Public Works Department through the BDBC to a Montreal TV producer so that the public would not learn the federal government had spent $125,000 dollars on the TV series Le Canada Millennaire. When Justice John Gomery asked Carle that \"If this were a drug deal, it would be called money-laundering\", to which Carle replied \"You're not wrong\". Carle argued that his actions were justified because: \"I felt it was a benefit for the bank to get an extra $125,000 in advertising without having to pay its own money, I did not do this in bad faith. We were kind of a transmission belt.\" In September 2001, Carle became chief of operations at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal, which received a doubling of federal sponsorship money by the Public Works ministry headed by Alfonso Gagliano, and then what the journalist Lawrence Martin called a highly unusual retroactive grant of $100,000. In April 2002, Carle left his post at the Just for Laughs festival for \"personal reasons\". Besides attracting controversy for his role in the sponsorship scandal, Carle was also involved in the Grand-Mère Affair. Carle was involved in the firing of François Beaudoin, president of the BDBC, in 1999 after he attempted to call in the loan to the Grand-Mère Inn. Beaudoin sued for wrongful dismissal following his sacking. In February 2004, Beaudoin won his wrongful dismissal suit against the Business Development Bank of Canada. Justice Andre Denis ruled in favor of Beaudoin's claim that he was fired for political reasons in 1999 for trying to call in the loan on the Grand-Mère Inn, ruled that Carle was guilty of making false criminal and civil charges of wrongdoing against Beaudoin to discredit him for suing the bank, accused Carle of committing perjury during the trial and declared given the \"unspeakable injustice\" Beaudoin had suffered, told the government not to appeal his ruling because they would be wasting taxpayers' money if they did. In March 2004, Carle was named as someone involved in the sponsorship scandal. Charles Guité claimed in 2004 that he regularly met with Carle when the latter was chief of operations at the PMO together with Jean Pelletier, Chrétien's chief of staff, to discuss what events to spend sponsorship money on, and how much. During the Gomery commission hearings in 2005, Lucienne Robillard testified that she was very surprised that Carle had been put in charge of Treasury Board policies on communication, public opinion polls and advertising, saying such a job was not normally performed by \"political staff\" from the PMO such as Carle. In his report on responsibility for the sponsorship scandal, Justice Gomery ruled that Guité's claim that he received his instructions from Pelletier and Carle was indeed the truth, and Carle in 1995 had helped Jean Brault of Groupaction advertising firm get in touch with Guité. During the 2008 election, Stéphane Dion told the media that Carle had some sort of role with the Liberal campaign, through he himself was not entirely sure what it was, only to have that statement denied later the same day by one of his aides, Nancy Girard."

He was the captain of the Boston College Eagles. He was nominated by Boston College as a Rhodes Scholar candidate. Raised in Trenton, New Jersey, he attended the Lawrenceville School before receiving an athletic scholarship to Boston College. Sweeney testified as a witness in the 1978–79 Boston College basketball point shaving scandal in which members of organized crime schemed to control the outcomes of several games. Sweeney was neither charged nor offered immunity in exchange for his testimony.The most notable article on the subject was a cover story featured in Sports Illustrated and narrated by Henry Hill. The subject of Jim Sweeney was later picked up in David Porter's book \"FIXED: How Goodfellas Bought Boston College Basketball.\" Following his 1980 graduation from BC, Jim Sweeney played basketball briefly in Sweden. He returned to the States, married fellow BC classmate Maura Haggerty Sweeney in 1981 and spent the following years as a manufacturer's rep in the computer industry. While still in his forties, Sweeney and his wife Maura closed their computer firm to launch New Vision Entertainment, a Florida-based LLC focused on the development and promotion of entertainment properties that positively impact culture. Creating a Trademarked sports personality named MIKE, Jim launched a series of MIKE Sports Comic Books and regularly blogs under the same pen name. He anticipates his character to eventually appear on a variety of sports media platforms. Jim Sweeney continues to play basketball domestically and abroad through the masters basketball circuit. Jim and his wife Maura have one daughter, formerly homeschooled and currently an international journalist working out of London. The couple resides in Clearwater, Florida and travel extensively."

  "text" : "Justus Wilhelm Martin Radius (14 November 1797, in Leipzig – 7 March 1884, in Leipzig) was a German pathologist and ophthalmologist. He obtained his medical doctorate in Leipzig in 1821, then furthered his education in Vienna, Berlin, London and Paris. In 1825 he became an associate professor for pathology in Leipzig, and in the meantime performed duties as a \"free-lance\" eye physician. In 1840 he was appointed professor of pathology, hygiene and pharmacology. In Leipzig, he also served as a physician at St. Georg Hospital (1825–53), and in 1843, following the death of Johann Christian August Heinroth, he was given additional duties as a \"part-time chair\" of psychiatry. From 1829 to 1861, he was director of the Medizinischen Gesellschaft zu Leipzig. In 1887 a new building for the Leipzig Conservatory was constructed by way of a donation from Radius. In 1910, the Radiusstraße, a thoroughfare in the Lindenau district of Leipzig, was named after him and his wife, Wilhelmine."

  "text" : "Johann Christian August Clarus (5 November 1774, Buch am Forst near Coburg – 13 July 1854, Leipzig) was a German anatomist and surgeon. In 1798 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Leipzig, where from 1803 to 1820, he served as an associate professor of anatomy and surgery. From 1820 to 1848 he was a professor of clinical medicine at the university as well as senior physician at Jacobshospital in Leipzig. In 1840/41 he served as university rector. From 1848 onward, he worked in his private medical practice. On 24 August 1821, he was called upon to write a report on the mental condition of confessed murderer Johann Christian Woyzeck (1780–1824). After meeting with Woyzeck, Clarus maintained that he was accountable for his actions, despite the fact that he suffered from hallucinations. Later on, he was asked to write a second report. He met with Woyzeck several more times, and reached the same conclusion as in his initial report. Clarus' writings on the mental state of Woyzeck were published with the title \"Die Zurechnungsfähigkeit des Morders Johann Christian Woyzeck\" and subsequently used as a source by dramatist Georg Büchner for the stage play \"Woyzeck\"."

  "text" : "John Joseph Eagan (born April 22, 1870 in Griffin, Georgia; died March 30, 1924 in Asheville, North Carolina) was an American industrialist and co-founder of the American Cast Iron Pipe Company (ACIPCO). Eagan was the son and only child of John Joseph and Mary V. Russell Eagan of Georgia. His father died of tuberculosis on July 19, 1870. His uncle William Russell, who owned the W. A. Russell Tobacco Company in Atlanta, moved Mary and John to Atlanta. John was studious and excelled in school, studied the Bible and was active, along with his mother, in Christian ministry at Central Presbyterian Church in Atlanta. The Eagans also lived for periods of time with Mary's sister in Cartersville and on the farm of a family friend. At age 16, Eagan left school and returned to Atlanta. He worked at a grocery store briefly until starting work at his uncle's tobacco store. At age 21, John inherited $6,000 from his grandmother. He invested the money and by 1899 had a fortune of over $73,000. When Eagan was 29, he inherited a $750,000 bequest from his uncle Russell. Eagan continued investing in property, stocks and a few businesses. Humbled by his blessings, Eagan tithed to the church, supported numerous charities benefiting the poor, and used his business influence to improve conditions for workers. A May 13, 1900 entry in Eagan's diary included this prayer: \"O Lord show me how to invest Thy wealth to promote Thy glory, so that I may bear much fruit.\" Although Eagan had prospered in the tobacco business inherited from his uncle, he did not believe this should be his life's work. In an April 7, 1901 diary entry, Eagan wrote: \"My chief end is to glorify God. I believe there are fields of endeavor where I can glorify Him more than in this business. Therefore it is my duty to get into the field where I can glorify Him most.\" In 1905, Charlotte Blair, secretary of Dimmick Pipe Company in Anniston, Alabama, along with her brother James W. Blair, interested several southern businessmen in the idea of starting a new pipe plant in Birmingham, Alabama. With its natural resources, access to raw materials and rail transportation, Birmingham was considered a well suited location. Eagan was one of five charter investors in the Birmingham pipe plant, which was named American Cast Iron Pipe Company and came to be recognized by the acronym ACIPCO. He served as the company's president from 1905 until 1915, when James McWane was named president and Eagan became chairman of the ACIPCO Board of Directors. McWane left ACIPCO in 1921 and Eagan began a second term as president, serving in this office until days before his death in 1924. In accord with his Christian beliefs, and influenced by social and industrial reform movements of the day, Eagan developed a business model at ACIPCO based on the \"Golden Rule\". He paid good wages and kept shifts to nine hours or less with overtime and sick leave, invested in worker safety programs, and treated all employees with fairness. He also constructed affordable housing for workers, as well as schools, churches, a medical clinic, a library, a bank, and an employee-operated store. He shared the company's profits with employees. While developing his plan for ACIPCO, Eagan bought back all the common stock of the company to become its sole owner by the end of 1921. In April 1923, Eagan added a codicil to his will placing all the company stock in a trust for employees. In Eagan's words, his object was to ensure \"service both to the purchasing public and to labor on the basis of the Golden Rule.\" When he died on March 30, 1924, ACIPCO became an employee-owned business, electing its own members to the company's board. Eagan had suffered from tuberculosis for many years and died from one of its common complications—meningitis. Eagan and his wife, the former Susan Baum Young, had two children, Bill and Ann. Eagan died in Asheville, North Carolina, where he had traveled in hopes of regaining his health. He is buried at Westview Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia. Eagan was inducted into the National Management Association Hall of Fame in 1998, the Kiwanis Club Birmingham Business Hall of Fame in 2001, and the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2014, Weld for Birmingham listed him among \"50 Who Shaped Birmingham.\" The former John J. Eagan School in Birmingham's Acipco-Finley neighborhood was named in his honor."

However, he lost his candidacy for the 1868 general election in favour of John Scourfield, who had been the member for Haverfordwest since 1852, which fell to the Liberals. Scourfield died in 1876, and Bowen won his second by-election to his old seat. He lost the seat at the next general election in 1880 to the Liberal William Davies. In 1889, he was defeated in the inaugural elections for Pembrokeshire County Council. He was subsequently made an alderman. His son was George Bevan Bowen."

  "text" : "James Thomas McCalman, Sr. (February 15, 1914 – June 18, 1977), was a Democratic member of the Louisiana State Senate, who represented Claiborne and Bienville parishes in North Louisiana from 1960 to 1964. McCalman was the older of two sons of Arkansas natives Herbert Carl McCalman, Sr., and the former Nobie Guice. A brother was Herbert McCalman, Jr. (1915-1961). McCalman previously lived in Athens, also in Claiborne Parish. He attended Homer High School, at which he played football on the 1929-1930 team. A businessman who resided in Homer, McCalman won the seat vacated by segregationist William M. Rainach, who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Louisiana in the 1959 Democratic primary election, having placed third in the contest won in a runoff by Jimmie Davis. After a single term, McCalman was unseated by Danny Roy Moore, another Democrat then from Claiborne Parish, who resides in Arcadia in Bienville Parish. Mrs. McCalman was the former Gladys Reavie Bennett (February 1, 1916 – April 12, 2015), the daughter of Ada and Barton Duvalle Bennett of rural Liddieville in Franklin Parish. She became a beautician after high school. She died at the age of ninety-nine in Madison, Mississippi. Five McCalman children were born between 1940 and 1952:Herbert Duvalle McCalman, George Lawson McCalman, and Joan McCalman Miller, all deceased, and James Thomas McCalman, Jr., of Kenner in Jefferson Parish; Lynda Ann McCalman-Tabor of Madison Mississippi; Donald Gene McCalman of Homer, and David Allen McCalman of Omaha, Nebraska. Like his Senate predecessor Rainach, McCalman is interred beside his wife at Arlington Cemetery in Homer. He was a Southern Baptist."

  "text" : "Josaphat Brunet was a senior police officer in Canada.In 1956 he was the founding director of the RCMP Security Service.In 1958 he was promoted to Deputy Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Following his retirement from the RCMP he became, briefly, the director of Security for the National Bank of Canada. Later in 1960 he was appointed Director General of the Sûreté du Québec, a post he held for five years. Brunet's son, Gilles Brunet, followed his father into the RCMP Security Service, where, at first, he seemed destined for promotion. But, in 1973, he was fired from the RCMP, due to ties to organized crime figures. Josaphat Brunet died in 1974. Western intelligence agencies would later learn that Josaphat's son Gilles had become a double agent for the Soviet Union and had been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to betray Canada and its allies. Another man, Leslie James Bennett, had been fired due to CIA suspicions that he was the mole within the RCMP. Commentators on intelligence matters would point out that Josaphat's role as the founding director of Canada's spy-catching agency had eased his son Gilles's attempts to evade detection, because he was \"one of us\"."

She was a strong advocate of the importance of field studies for providing essential skills for geography graduates. Her capacity as a teacher was as highly regarded as her research — she was known to be enthusiastic and engaging to a wide range of audiences - a medal has been created by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in honour of her commitment to Geographical Education and Teaching."

  "text" : "John Morgan Howell (1855-1928) was a prominent figure in the public life of Cardiganshire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A supporter of the Liberal Party he represented Aberaeron as a county councillor for over thirty years and served on many other public bodies. Shortly after his election as a county councillor in 1889, Howell married Ann Evans at the Tabernacle Calvinistic Methodist Church, Aberaeron. Howell was a prominent figure at Tabernacle, became its precentor in 1874, and was also superintendent of the Sunday school from a young age. It was said that he was the mainstay of the musical festivals, or cymanfaoedd held in the district. Howell was a prominent businessman and operated a flourishing ironmongery business at Portland House, Aberaeron. He served as a director of the Lampeter and Aberayron Railway which opened in 1911. In many ways he represented the urban, commercial, middle class, who became a powerful new force within society in Cardiganshire during the 1880s. J.M. Howell was associated with the radical wing of the Liberal Party in Cardiganshire and a keen supporter of policies such as land refoem and disestablishment. His submission to the 1894 Enquiry into the Land Question in Wales reflects his outlook. 'There is a spirit of vassalage among the tillers of the soil', according to his evidence, 'begotten by the tyranny of the past. The shadows of the oppression and evictions of 1868 have not lifted from among the people'. This was a reference to the general election of 1868 in Wales, which had been charcaterised by allegations of coercion by landownsrs at what proved to be the last election before the introduction of the ballot. However, recent historians have questioned the traditional version and claimed that there were also examples of coercion by nonconformist ministers. Elected to the Cardiganshire County Council at the first elections in 1889, Howell became chairman of the Council in 1895-6 and was made an alderman in 1898. Having served as a county councillor for thirty years the veteran Howell became embroiled in the infighting within the Liberal Association between supporters of Lloyd George and Asquith after the First World War. He presided at a meeting addressed by Asquith at Aberystwyth in 1919 and was invited to stand as an Asquithian Liberal candidate in 1921 when Lloyd George engineered a peerage for Vaughan Davies to allow his supporter Ernest Evans to contest the seat. Howell, however, refused, and announced that he supported Lloyd George. He regularly wrote articles for there Welsh language press on political and literary subjects and was also a keen amateur poet."

  "text" : "Jesse Haworth (1835–1921) was a British cotton magnate who provided financial support for the archaeological work of W.M. Flinders Petrie. His interest in Egyptology probably began in 1877, when the novelist Amelia B. Edwards published her best seller, \"A 1000 Miles Up the Nile\". Edwards was a long-time supporter of Petrie. Haworth and his wife read her book and they were soon following her journey up the Nile. Haworth was a partner in the Manchester firm of James Dilworth and Sons. As well as sponsoring Egyptology, he also collected paintings and Wedgwood ceramics. Petrie recalls in his autobiography \"While in England, I heard that the offer of help in excavating came from Jesse Haworth of Manchester, though the kind intervention of Miss Edwards. Just at the same time, I had an offer of assistance from Martyn Kennard who had a family interest in Egypt. Nevertheless, I did not wish to pledge my time to be entirely at the service of anyone. The plan, which worked very smoothly, was that I drew on my two friends for all the costs of workmen and transport, while I paid all my expenses. In return, we equally divided all that came to England. Thus it was in my interest to fund as much as I could.\" In 1890 Haworth and Kennard presented their collection of objects from Kahun, and another Fayoum town site Gurob, to The Manchester Museum. In 1912 with the collection rapidly expanding, Haworth made a substantial contribution to the building fund to primarily house the Egyptian collections. In recognition of his generosity, and of his position as one of the first patrons of scientific excavation in Egypt, The University of Manchester conferred upon Jesse Haworth the honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws. In 1919, Jesse Haworth donated a further £10,000 to the museum, and under the terms of his Will, in 1921, he bequeathed a further £30,000 along with his private collection of Egyptian Antiquities. In 1920, Haworth approved plans for a third stage of the Museum building which would provide a further display area as well as much-needed workrooms and a storage space for the collection. His widow opened this extension in November 1927."

  "text" : "Joshua E. Friedel is an American chess Grandmaster and was U.S. Open Champion in 2013. He was born and raised in Goffstown, New Hampshire, and learned to play chess at age three. At age six he became a student under NM Hal Terrie and entered his first tournament that same year. It was an adult tournament, and thus as the lowest rated he got a first round bye and proceeded to lose the next three games. While his result was not atypical for a new tournament player, his enthusiasm for the game was not diminished by his lack of success. At age 8 Josh won the NH Amateur (U2000) Championship, having the lowest rating in the open section. The next year he won the National K-3 Championship in Tucson, Arizona. As a junior, he was often at the top of his age group, competing in the US Cadet (3 times), Junior Closed (twice), Denker, and World Youth (3) events. He won numerous New England tournaments as well as the US Open Expert Section in 2000 at age 13.After reaching the master level at age 14, Josh worked with GMs Larry Christiansen, Gregory Kaidanov, and Alex Goldin. He made IM at age 18 and GM just before his 22nd birthday. Thus far in his young chess career, Josh has been state champion of New Hampshire three times and twice of California. He has also won or tied for first in several open tournaments across the United States, including the Pan Am, Eastern, St. Louis, National, American, and North American Opens. Josh has played in six U.S. Closed Championships. At the 2008 event in Tulsa, he tied for fourth and scored his final GM norm. Josh also has competed in numerous international events. He represented the US at the 2008 World Mind Sports Games, as well as at two Continental Championships (2009 and 2011). Also in 2009, by tying for 6th at the US Championship in St. Louis, Josh qualified to compete at the World Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia. In the same year he also won the Toronto Open with a perfect 5/5 score and the Edmonton International with 7/9. He tied for first at the 2013 Chicago Open, also with 7/9. On August 4, 2013 he won the United States Open Chess Championship."

  "text" : "Juan Quezada Celado (born May 6, 1940) is a Mexican potter known for the re-interpretation of Casas Grandes pottery known as Mata Ortiz pottery. Quezada is from a poor rural town in Chihuahua, who discovered and studied pre Hispanic pottery of the Mimbres and Casas Grandes cultures. He eventually worked out how the pots were made with no help from ceramicists or specialists in these cultures. Initial attempts to sell the pots in his area failed, but he did have success with border merchants. These brought the pottery to shops on the U.S. side of the border, where they were discovered by Spencer MacCallum, an anthropologist who tracked Quezada down and helped him break into the larger U.S. market. Quezada’s success in pottery sparked interest in the activity by others in the town and he responded by teaching family and friends. Today there are over 300 families who earn all or part of their income from the pottery. Quezada’s work has been displayed in museums in various countries and in 1999 he was awarded the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes. Despite this, his work is still relatively unknown in Mexico."

He was also present in the Wars of Kappel against Protestant Zürich in 1529 and 1531. He received Lucerne citizenship in 1529 (after the First War of Kappel), and from 1531 he worked as secretary to the Lucerne court of justice, a prestigious position earlier held by other notable Swiss chroniclers (Melchior Russ, Petermann Etterlin), and published literary works, often of a polemical and satirical nature. He also compiled historical works commissioned by the Catholic cantons of the Swiss Confederacy.He attacked the reformation in his 1531 Tanngrotz (a term for \"fir-sprig\", the badge of the Catholic troops). When Heinrich Bullinger reacted in a pamphlet Salz zum Salat (i.e. \"salt for the salad\", punning on Salat's surname), he followed up with the much more acrimonious Triumphus Herculis Helvetici which portrayed Zwingli and his Reformation as an obscene witches' sabbath. In 1537, Salat published a more conciliatory \"book of warning to the Thirteen Cantons\". Salat was also in charge of several dramatic performances during his time at Lucerne, the most notable of which was the Easter play at Lucerne in 1538. He lost his employment in Lucerne due to fraud in 1540 and worked in Fribourg as school-master during the 1540s.He does not appear to have fared well in Fribourg, repeatedly imploring the Lucerne authorities to let him return, even threatening to change his allegiance to the Protestant camp should they refuse. In 1547 he lost his post as a school-master due to the performance of a students' play that was considered lewd. From that time, he survived offering his services as a leech, alchemist and astrologist, until he was allowed to return to Sursee in 1552 after which there are no more records of him. He was dead by October 1561."

  "text" : "Judith Meuli (1938-2007) was an American feminist activist and scientist. She received a bachelor of science degree from the University of Minnesota, and was a research scientist at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, and the University of California, Los Angeles, where she studied renal physiology. However, she was dissuaded from entering medical school because she was a woman and because she was considered too old at 30. She cowrote The Feminization of Power (1988) with Toni Carabillo (her partner) and cowrote The Feminist Chronicles (1993) with Toni Carabillo and June Csida. The Feminization of Power grew out of a traveling exhibit that Meuli and Carabillo created for a twelve-city Feminization of Power campaign tour to empower women to run for office in 1988. In 1967, Meuli cofounded the Los Angeles National Organization for Women, and in 1968 she was elected to serve for two years as its secretary. From 1971 to 1977, she served almost continuously as a member of NOW's National Board of Directors. From 1971 through 1974, she served as Chair of the National Membership Committee of NOW, instituting reforms such as central dues collection and an anniversary payment system. In 1974, she also chaired NOW's National Nominating Committee. In 1976, she was elected coordinator of NOW's Hollywood chapter. She was a co-editor of NOW Acts from 1970–73 and the National NOW Times from 1977-1985. She was also the editor of \"Financing the Revolution\" in 1973. She later was president of Los Angeles NOW from 1998-2000. Meuli also edited the National NOW publication \"Do it NOW\" with Toni Carabillo, and created with Carabillo a line of feminist jewelry that raised money for NOW and the Equal Rights Amendment campaign. In 1969, she co-founded the Women's Heritage Corporation, a publishing company that produced the Women's Heritage Calendar and Almanac and a series of paperbacks on people such as Lucy Stone and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. In 1970, she formed a graphic arts firm with Carabillo in Los Angeles, Women's Graphic Communications, that produces and distributes books, newspapers, political buttons, and pins. She was also a cofounder and board member of the Feminist Majority; in 1990, she designed and constructed a building in which to keep their archives and media center. She designed many graphic images for T-shirts, buttons, etc., most famously one that combines the symbol for women with the \"equals\" sign across the circle, called the Brassy, one of which was given to Pope Paul VI by Betty Friedan in 1973. She made designs for Woman's Equality, Human Liberation, Sisterhood, Matriarchy Lives, Woman's Peace, Older Women's League, Equal Rights Amendment, Woman Thinker, Failure Is Impossible, NOW's Commemorative medallion, and many feminist issue pins in cloisonné enamel. She also designed the Veteran Feminists of America pin and medal of honor, and was a member of their national board. They gave her their Trailblazer Award in 2006. She suffered from multiple myeloma. She donated some feminist historical artifacts to the Schlesinger Library. She is featured in Who's Who in America, Who's Who in American Women, and Feminists Who Changed America. She died in 2007 at age 69."

Donaldson was returned to the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Warrego on 5 October 1883 holding that seat until 19 May 1888; later he represented Bulloo from 26 May 1888 to 25 April 1893 and then Logan from 4 April 1896 until his death on 25 July 1896. Donaldson was appointed Postmaster-General of Queensland and Secretary for Public Instruction in the Thomas McIlwraith Ministry on 13 June 1888; and when the ministry was reconstructed under Boyd Dunlop Morehead, on 30 November in that year, continued to hold the same posts until 19 November 1889, when he succeeded William Pattison as Colonial Treasurer. He resigned with his colleagues in August 1890, owing to the opposition of the Assembly to his financial proposals. Donaldson was one of the Queensland delegates to the Federation Convention held at Sydney in March 1891. Donaldson died in Coorparoo, Queensland on 25 July 1896, survived by his second wife Gertrude Evelyn née Willis, two sons by his first marriage (to Margaret, née Walker, married in 1869; predeceased Donaldson) and a son and two daughters by his second marriage. Following a short service at his late Coorparoo residence, Donaldson was buried in Toowong Cemetery."

He co-founded along with Robert Frager the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, which later became Sofia University (California), where he was a lecturer in psychedelic studies. Fadiman was born in Los Angeles and lived in Westwood. His father, William Fadiman, was a producer and story editor, and book reviewer in Hollywood, one of his credits being The Last Frontier. While in Paris, his friend and former professor, Ram Dass (then known as Richard Alpert), introduced him to psilocibin. Fadiman was part of the team in the Psychedelics in problem-solving experiment, which was abruptly halted in 1966. He was a president of the Association for Transpersonal Psychology. He was also a director at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. Fadiman received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard University and a Master's degree and a doctorate (both in psychology) from Stanford University. Fadiman and Robert Frager published a textbook on personality theory, which was one of the first to incorporate Eastern theories of personality alongside Western approaches. Personality and Personal Growth has been republished in seven editions as of 2012. He is married to documentary filmmaker Dorothy Fadiman and is the father of Florida Atlantic University professor Maria Fadiman. His uncle was Clifton Fadiman and he is a cousin of Anne Fadiman."

James Bernard Knighten (December 11, 1919 – November 9, 2000) was one of the first twelve African-Americans to become a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps after graduating from flight school at the Tuskegee Army Air Field. He became a member of the famed 99th Fighter Squadron, part of the World War II-era group of highly decorated African-American aviators known as the Tuskegee Airmen. Knighten flew in the first combat mission by African American pilots on June 9, 1943. Knighten's military career continued through the Korean and Vietnam Wars. After retiring from the military in 1968, he had a 20-year career with the Federal Aviation Administration as an operations inspector in New York and later in Los Angeles. Known as a jokester through his military career, Knighten began performing as a stand-up comedian in Las Vegas under the name of Jay Bernard during his years at the FAA, finally moving to Las Vegas to perform full-time after retiring from his position with the FAA."

  "text" : "Jack Muller (1923-2005) was a Chicago Police Detective. Muller was born to Hungarian and Polish immigrants in Chicago, Illinois, where he attended Marshall High School and was an All State fullback on their football team. He went to the University of Michigan on a football scholarship, but dropped out of school to enlist in the U.S. Navy and spent World War II serving in the Pacific theatre aboard the USS Sheldrake as a mine sweeping specialist. On January 18, 1946 Muller received a hardship discharge and returned home to help care for his dying father. Four weeks later, he took the Chicago Police exam and passed. In 1946 a Chicago Police officer's salary was $2900 per year. The first parking ticket Jack wrote was for an illegally parked car on Argyle Street; as he was tucking the ticket under the wiper blade, the man that owned the car ran up and tried to persuade him to tear it up. He was a small political figure in the city, and when the court case came up, the judge threw it out. This incident had a profound impact on Muller and set the stage of fighting with corrupt city officials for his entire career. In 1953 Muller was assigned traffic duty on Rush Street. In the narrow night club–lined street, there was never enough parking, and keeping the lanes open and cars moving was a big job. He soon became a familiar sight, patrolling the street on his motorcycle. On August 7, 1954, Muller observed a Cadillac going east down the westbound lane of Oak St. The car was driven by the wife of chief judge of the Superior Court of Cook County Samuel B. Epstein, and the judge was in the passenger seat. Eyewitnesses reported that as the officer was taking his ticket book out of his pocket, the judge's wife jumped out of the car, slapping his face and kicking him in the shin. The judge got out and ran around the car and jumped on Muller's back. After he had the couple under control and called for backup, the judge's wife said she had been hit by the officer and wanted to go to the hospital. The judge was taken into the station, where he received a $6 traffic fine and was sent away. The next day, as a reprimand, Muller lost his two-wheel motorcycle and was issued a three-wheeler instead. Muller made no secret of the fact he didn't like the three-wheeler, and many of the Rush Street crowd started calling it \"the Mullercycle\". Jack Muller was starting to become famous for ticketing anyone that deserved it, politicians, celebrities; no one was immune. Jack arrested Cubs broadcaster Jack Brickhouse, towed the car of Illinois Governor William Stratton and ticketed Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. On October 24, 1955, Life Magazine reported that Officer Muller wrote 15,000 traffic tickets a year. In October 1967, while assigned to an auto theft unit of the Chicago Police, Muller discovered that other officers were selling tires that had been seized in police raids. He reported his findings to his commander, who in turn relayed the report to the Commander of the Auto Theft Division. Five days later, after seeing there was no further investigation, Muller submitted his charges to the Superintendent of the Chicago Police. Three weeks later, Muller was interviewed on television concerning his charges, where he told of corruption in the Department. When asked by the reporter why Muller hadn't made his complaints to the Internal Investigation Unit, he replied, \"The IID is like a big washing machine, all the dirty cops that go in, come out clean.\""

  "text" : "James Phillips (\"Jim\") Kingston (8 July 1857 – 14 March 1929) was an English cricketer active from 1875 to 1894 who played for Northamptonshire (Northants) and Warwickshire. He was born in Hardingstone, Northamptonshire and died in Naples, Italy. Kingston was a righthanded batsman who bowled leg breaks. He appeared in one first-class match in 1894 for Warwickshire and scored 24 runs in his only innings. He had a long career with Northants from its foundation in 1878 until 1892. Kingston was the first officially appointed Northants club captain, holding the post from 1878 to 1887 and again in 1890 and 1891. Andrew Radd describes Kingston as \"truly a Northamptonshire cricketing pioneer\". Kingston was a key figure in the foundation of the club, became its first captain and eventually its first paid administrator. He was one of nine brothers, eight of whom played for Northants, and first became involved in 1875 when he played for an ad hoc county team. On 31 July 1878, he played for South Northants against North Northants on the Racecourse Ground Promenade in Northampton and scored 128. That evening, he attended a meeting in the town's George Hotel which formed the county club and elected its first committee of sixteen members, including Kingston himself who was then 21 years old and appointed team captain. Kingston became a solicitor but managed to combine his cricket with his profession. In May 1886, he captained Northants in their first-ever match at the Wantage Road County Ground. In 1891, Kingston became the first paid administrator at Northants as club secretary but this was an unhappy and short-lived experience. The club's finance were \"in a mess when he took up the post\". The deficit was deepening daily with an added threat to the club of litigation by one of its professional bowlers. Kingston soon resigned and, a year later, retired from playing as he was moving his business to Birmingham. However, he joined Warwickshire for a short period and was finally able to make his first-class debut, playing against Leicestershire in 1894. After his wife died a few years later, Kingston quit England and emigrated to Italy where he was an English teacher for the rest of his working life. He died in Naples, aged 71."

  "text" : "Julius Ness was the Resident Circuit Judge for the Second Judicial Circuit of South Carolina. He was born in Manning, South Carolina, USA, the eldest of five children of Morris and Rae Levy Ness, on February 27, 1916. His family moved to Denmark, South Carolina, when he was a young boy, and his mother and father lived there until their deaths. He had two brothers, Harold and Arthur, and two sisters, Sylvia and Rita. His friends and family knew him as \"Bubba\", a name given him by one of his younger sisters because she could not pronounce Julius. Ness graduated from Denmark High School, then the University of South Carolina. He graduated from academic school in 1938 and law school in 1940. Upon graduation from law school, he moved to Bamberg, South Carolina, where he lived until his death in 1991. Ness initially practiced with the late Senator J. Carl Kearse, at a salary of US$30 per month. In 1941, Ness enlisted in the United States Armed Forces. He first attended flight school, but did not complete the training. Upon leaving flight school Ness, with lifelong-friend, W. E. \"Pete\" Brooker, joined the United States Army, where Ness earned the rank of Captain, in the 349th Infantry of the 88th Division. He was critically and permanently injured in 1944 while serving in the snow-covered mountains of Italy. Against orders his friend Pete went back onto the battlefield, and found and rescued Ness. When the surgeon inspected his wounds, Ness was told his leg would have to be amputated. At the prospect of losing his leg, Ness drew his Colt, Model 1911 or M1911, .45 caliber, semi-automatic sidearm and threatened that if he woke up without his leg, he would kill the doctor that took it. The doctors did not attempt the amputation, and after many months of recuperation, Ness went home to Bamberg. For his service, he was awarded the Bronze Star, Silver Star, and two Purple Heart medals. Ness went back to work with Senator Kearse, and the firm later became known as Kearse and Ness. Ness married Katherine Rhoad in January, 1946. He was heavily involved in Bamberg County community activities, and in 1954, he was elected to represent the Second Judicial Circuit, on the South Carolina Highway Commission. He stayed on the commission, and acted as Chairman in 1956. That same year, when Senator Kearse retired from the South Carolina Senate, Ness was elected, in an unopposed election, and he served until 1958. In 1958 Ness went on the bench as the Resident Circuit Judge for the Second Judicial Circuit. Ness was elected as an associate justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court and sworn in on December 5, 1974. Ness was elected to be the Chief Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court in June 1985, was sworn in on June 18, 1985, and retired in February 1988 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 72."

One of nine children in the Naranjo family of Santa Clara potters and artists, Folwell is one of the best-known avant-garde Pueblo potters. Lee Cohen, the late owner of Gallery 10 in Santa Fe and Scottsdale, referred to Folwell as the \"first impressionist potter\" for her \"innovative, off-round, uneven-lipped, asymmetrical polished pots\". Folwell is known for her use of social commentary and satire in her pots. In 1984, she collaborated with sculptor Bob Haozous to create a pot that received the Best of Show award at Santa Fe Indian Market. Fowler's pots are in the permanent collection of the National Museum of the American Indian. Folwell has two daughters, Susan Folwell and Polly Rose Folwell, who are both accomplished, award-winning potters. In 2009-2010 the Heard Museum featured works by all three women in their \"Mothers & Daughters: Stories in Clay\" exhibit. Folwell’s mother, Rose Naranjo, was also an accomplished Santa Clara potter. Of her work, Folwell has said, \"I think of each piece as an artwork that has something to say on its own, a statement about life. I think of myself as being a contemporary potter and a traditionalist at the same time. Combining the two is very emotional and exciting to me.\""

His debut for Geelong came in the final home and away round of the 1980 VFL season, against Footscray at Waverley Park. Smith had 20 disposals. He next played in Geelong's four point preliminary final loss to Collingwood. Although he missed a grand final, Smith did get to play in Geelong's 1980 reserves premiership team. He played in another reserves premiership in 1981, but didn't make a senior appearance all year. In 1982 he went to Fitzroy, where he played seven senior games. He returned to Geelong West once his VFL career came to an end, then in 1985 was appointed coach of North Shore."

He was second son of Robert Shafto of Benwell Towers, Northumberland. He served in the army with the 1st Foot Guards, being commissioned as Ensign in 1745 and retiring as Lieutenant in 1755. He married on 24 November 1750 Margaret, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Allen who was one of the main coal-owners of County Durham. The couple had no children and she died in 1766. He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of Great Britain for Leominster 1761 - 1768 and for Castle Rising from 1768 until his death. His only recorded speech in the House of Commons was made on 18 March 1762, proposing the militia be sent to serve abroad, during the Seven Years' War, reputedly done to win a wager of £200 laid at his London club, Arthur's. As a horse owner, Shafto's thoroughbred racers included: Snap, which he bought in 1752  and sold after it had won three 1000-guinea match races at Newmarket; Squirrel, another successful racer which was retired for stud in 1760 and lived until 1780; and Goldfinder, sired by Snap, which won two Newmarket Challenge Cups and Whips before being sold to stud. He was reported to have rode 100 miles every day for 29 days to Newmarket Heath, and then for 50 miles for 2 hours, for bets. In 1763, his reputation as a winning gambler at Newmarket was such that Horace Walpole wrote to Lord Hertford: \"The beginning of October, one is certain everybody will be at Newmarket, and the Duke of Cumberland will lose, and Shafto win, two or three thousand pounds.\". He committed suicide, having shot himself, in May 1771, which many attributed to gambling losses on the turf and elsewhere"

  "text" : "John N. Dennis (born February 25, 1933) is an American Republican Party politician and business executive who served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1968 to 1974, and again from 1976 to 1978. A graduate of Montclair High School and Lehigh University, he served in the U.S. Army from 1954 to 1956. Dennis was an executive in his family business, Annin & Co., one of the nation's largest flagmakers. He was elected to the New Jersey State Assembly in 1967, running in Essex County District 11E. He was the top vote getter in the Republican primary with 7,189 votes, followed by Herbert Rinaldi with 7,066 votes. They defeated Beatrice Carlson of Montclair (5,065) and Joseph Napolitano (4,812). In the general election, Dennis and Rinaldi defeated Democrats Ralph G. Conte and John T. Regan. Legislative redistricting in 1969 placed three incumbents in two Assembly seats: Dennis, Republican Kenneth T. Wilson, and Democrat Frank J. Dodd. Wilson and Dennis won, with 28,233 and 27,890 votes, respectively. His victory over Dodd was just 874 votes, 27,890 to 27,016. Democrat William J. Fusco ran fourth with 24,658 votes. Dodd would later return to the Assembly, move up to the Senate, serve as New Jersey Senate President and seek the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey in 1981. In 1971, when Rinaldi declined to seek re-election, Dennis ran with Republican Carl Orechio. They defeated Democrats Peter A. Torre, Jr. and David W. Conrad, by more than 7,500 votes. Dennis lost his bid for re-election to a fourth term in the Democratic landslide of 1973, running in the newly created 27th district, which included northern Essex County suburbs of Nutley, Montclair, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Verona, Caldwell, Essex Fells and Cedar Grove. In the general election, Orechio was narrowly re-elected, 27,395 votes to 26,877 votes, against Democrat James J. Mills of Glen Ridge. The top vote getter in that race was Democrat Robert Ruane with 28,465 votes. Dennis finished fourth with 25,764 votes. In 1975, Dennis mounted a successful comeback bid, defeating Ruane 26,471 to 23,404. Orechio finished first with 26,773, and Democrat Herbert Lev finished fourth with 18,886 votes. Dennis decided to run for the New Jersey Senate in 1977, taking on one-term Democrat Carmen Orechio, Carl Orechio's brother. He won 78% of the vote in the Republican primary against Francis M. Adams, but lost the general election to Orechio by 918 votes, 25,773 (51%)to 24,855 (49.%)."

  "text" : "According to Sir Lewis Namier, he was a Presbyterian from Berwick-upon-Tweed who became rich as a businessman and banker in London. By 1757 he was appearing in commercial directories and by 1759 was a substantial investor in government stock. At some point he also acquired lands and slaves in the West Indies, at his death holding the estate of Hoghole in the parish of St Thomas-in-the-Vale on Jamaica and another estate on Tobago. He retained links with his birthplace, where in 1765 he was mentioned as a political opponent of Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland's supporters and in the general election of 1774 came top of the poll, becoming MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in the Parliament of Great Britain. He did not stand again in the 1780 general election, but in 1781 won a seat at Honiton. While sitting, he also sought election as a director of the East India Company, which he achieved in 1782. However, when the government in 1783 proposed greater parliamentary control over the activities of the Company, Wilkinson resigned his directorship. He did not stand again in the general election of 1784, so ending his political career. He died at his home in Bedford Row, Holborn, on 24 June 1799."

  "text" : "Colonel John Hamilton Gillespie (14 October 1852 – 7 September 1923) was a Scottish-American soldier, land developer, businessman and politician, who settled in Sarasota, Florida, becoming Sarasota's first mayor. Gillespie was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. As a boy he lived with his family at 53 Northumberland Street, Edinburgh and was educated at the nearby Edinburgh Academy and subsequently at the University of St Andrews. Like his father, he was a member of the Royal Company of Archers. (a ceremonial unit that serves as the Sovereign's Bodyguard in Scotland). He was admitted to The Society of Writers to Her Majesty’s Signet in 1875 and also served as a captain in the Midlothian Coast Artillery Volunteers. Upon his return from colonial service in Australia, his father, Sir John Gillespie, sent him to Sarasota, Florida in 1886 to work for the Florida Mortgage and Investment Company. Gillespie found his father’s company in poor condition and began improving the community in Sarasota and soon business was booming. In May 1886 he laid out two golf holes on his property. This was the first golf course in Florida and the second in the United States. An avid golfer, Gillespie learned the game at St. Andrews. In 1905 he built a nine-hole course on property now which is now the site of the Sarasota County Courthouse, Florida. He went on to lay out courses for Henry Plant, Tampa, Winter Park and Havana, Cuba. Sarasota was incorporated as a town on October 14, 1902, coincidentally Gillespie's 50th birthday, and he went on to served as the Town's first Mayor. He was subsequently elected to five additional one-year terms. Gillespie was instrumental in founding the Episcopal Church in Sarasota. He was ordained as a Deacon in the Episcopal Church and is acknowledged as the founder of The Church of the Redeemer Sarasota."

  "text" : "Jakov of Kamena Reka (Macedonian: Јаков од Камена Река, Serbian: Јаков из Камене реке; fl. 1564–72) or Jakov Krajkov (Јаков Крајков, Bulgarian: Яков Крайков) was a Venetian printer. The information about his life is scarce. It is known he was from a former village called Kamena Reka or Stone River, according to him near the town of Kolasia, in Osogovo, Macedonia. It is assumed that the village could be Makedonska Kamenica in present-day Republic of Macedonia, or Kamenichka Skakavitsa, in present-day Bulgaria, both placed in an area in Osogovo called Kamenitsa, near the town of Kyustendil. Also, in some works his birthplace is connected with Kamena Reka, near Kolasin in Herzegovina in today Montenegro. Nevertheless, that view is criticized as 19th century Šafárik's misinterpretation of the medieval name of Kyustendil (Kolasia) with that of the town of Kolasin, that was adopted afterwards by other researchers. His family members had a long tradition of being Christian priests. In his youth Kraikov was a copyist of Church Slavonic books in the Osogovo Monastery \"St. Joakim Osogovski\". Then he went to Sofia, where in a local Church school, Kraikov deepened his literary knowledge. However some researchers maintain that Jakov of Sofia and Jakov of Kamena Reka are different historical persons. Afterwards, he set off through Kyustendil and Skopje to Venice. It is assumed that Kraikov worked on his way in Gračanica monastery where a printing press was opened. He was among the first printers of Cyrillic books. Kraikov reached Venice around 1564 or 1565 where he worked in the Vuković printing house, established by Božidar Vuković and inherited by his son Vićenco Vuković. In 1566 (in period of only three and a half months) he printed the Book of hours (Casoslov) of 710 pages on the printing press of Vićenco Vuković. It was printed in Serbian recension of the Church Slavonic language. To print this book Jakov used old, already worn out, sorts. He had at disposal Vuković's matrix and was prepared to cast new letters but he obviously failed to do it. This book is described in some sources as the first Bulgarian/Macedonian printed book. In 1570 Jakov worked in the printing press of Jerolim Zagurović where he printed a Prayer book. In 1571 Jakov again worked in Vuković printing house, where Stefan Marinović also worked before him. In 1597 this printing house was taken over by Italian printers (Bartolomeo Ginammi, Marco Ginammi, Giovanni Antonio Rampazetto, Francesco Rampazetto, Georgio Rampazetto, Camillo Zanetti) and its printing press was operational for additional 70 years."

  "text" : "Joaquin Jim, (183? - 1863 or 1866) was a Western Mono, war leader of the Owens Valley Indian War. Joaquin Jim, implacable war leader of the Mono allies of the Owens Valley Paiute, never surrendered to American forces or made peace with them, but reported to have ceased warfare against them in 1864. Joaquin Jim was said to have been an outlawed Western Mono from what is now Fresno County, California. Following the death of Shondow he became the leader of the Eastern Mono that lived north of Big Pine Creek. Captain Moses A. McLaughlin raided Joaquin Jim's Camp on May 18, 1863 destroying it but he and his people escaped. Captain George and over 1000 Owens Valley Paiute surrendered soon after and promised to help McLaughlin against Joaquin Jim. In late June 1863, Captain McLaughlin sent a column with 90 soldiers and 26 Paiute including Captain George that trailed Joaquin Jim through Round Valley, up Pine Creek and over Italy Pass into the Sierra Nevada Mountains, losing him a week later. Jim returned to Long Valley and dominated the northern Owens Valley and Adobe Meadows once McLaughlin left Camp Independence for Fort Tejon. He established his claim in the White Mountains with a red cloth banner trimmed with raven feathers. Settlers petitioned for a return of the troops to protect them, describing: \"...the notorious Joaquin Jim, chief of the Pi-Utes in this region since the removal of Captain George to Fort Tejon, with his own particular adherents, together with many fugitives from Fort Tejon and renegades from Captain George's tribe or division, are now settled in our midst; that is to say, on Bishop's Creek, near Owensville and upon the identical ground upon which Mr. Scott, sheriff of this county, and Colonel Mayfield were killed some two years ago. It is a well-known fact that Joaquin Jim is now and ever has been an uncompromising enemy of the whites; that he refused to emigrate with his people under treaty made with the U. S. authorities; that the many murders and outrages committed in this valley since the withdrawal of Government troops from this locality is traceable to the implacable animosity of this captain or chief to our people.\" Two accounts of his death are incompatible. One report has him being injured in the war and killed in the San Joaquin Valley in April 1863. This seems unlikely since it was prior to the McLaughlin Campaign, when Joaquin Jim was still leading a band in the upper valley. Another, Owens Valley Paiute report, has him dying in the winter of 1865-66, in Long Valley at the Casa Diablo geysers some years after the war after eating a tribal delicacy. The white settlers claim he was killed by one of his own warriors."

His father (James Meek I) came to York from Brompton by Northallerton, where he had run a starch mill. He was an Anglican and was also at Kelfield, North Yorkshire. James Meek II was born in 1890 in Brompton, Northallerton; he came to York in 1803 to serve an apprenticeship with Joseph Agar, currier. After working in various cities he returned to York on his marriage, setting up his own business in Goodramgate, York. He was a partner in the York Flint Glass Company and chairman of York City and County Bank. For a time he was also chairman of Hudson's York and North Midland Railway and of the Newcastle and Berwick Railway, but as a staunch Methodist, he resigned in a controversy regarding Sunday travel on the railway. He laid the foundation stone of the York cemetery chapel during his first term as Lord Mayor. He was Lord Mayor of York in 1836, 1848 and 1850, the final time being immediately before George Hudson. He was also Sheriff of York in 1827 and was an Alderman of the city from 1835 until his death."

  "text" : "John Cridland, CBE (born 3 February 1961) was the tenth Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) from January 2011 to November 2015. He was educated at Boston Grammar School and studied Indian and African history at Christ's College, Cambridge. He joined the CBI as a policy adviser in 1982 and became its youngest ever director in 1991, when he took over the environmental affairs brief. He moved on to human resources policy in 1995, where he helped negotiate the UK’s first national minimum wage and entry into the European Union’s “social chapter” on employment conditions. He was promoted to the post of Deputy Director-General in 2000. Beyond his work with the CBI, Cridland served on the Low Pay Commission from its formation in 1997 until 2007. He was Vice Chair of the National Learning and Skills Council between 2007 and 2010 and spent 10 years on the Low Pay Commission and the Council of the conciliation service, ACAS. He was also a member of the Commission on Environmental Markets and Economic Performance and the Women and Work Commission; Vice-Chairman of the Learning and Skills Council; a Board member of Business in the Community; a UK Commissioner for Employment and Skills and a member of the Council of Cranfield University. He announced his decision to step down as Director-General in March 2015, saying “I’m a big Star Trek fan and just like James Kirk I have always told colleagues at internal meetings that I saw this as part of a five-year journey.” His resignation followed in November. He was succeeded by Carolyn Fairbairn John Cridland was appointed a CBE for services to business in 2006 and Honorary Doctorates from the University of Lincoln in 2011 and the University of Bedfordshire in 2013. Unlike his five predecessors John Cridland was not awarded a Knighthood, at the end of his term as Director General at CBI. In March 2016 the UK Department of Work and Pensions announced that Cridland would lead the UK's first State Pension age review. He is married with two teenage children and lives in Bedfordshire."

  "text" : "She was born in Stafford but moved to Wales in 1983 before moving home to care for her mother. Her mother Bella Bailey, who was 86, was admitted to Stafford Hospital in September 2007 with an enlarged hernia and died there on 8 November 2007. She helped to form an organisation, Cure the NHS, which successfully campaigned for a public inquiry into the failings at the hospital. She ran a dog grooming parlour and a small cafe, Breaks, in Lichfield Road in the centre of the town which became the headquarters of the campaign. She and her supporters plastered the walls with photographs of dozens of elderly men and women – husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters – they claimed had died unnecessarily at the hospital because of lack of care. She was nationally praised for her determination to shine a light on the failings of the Trust. In Stafford some people have blamed her for a planned downgrade of the town’s hospital. She says she suffered abuse in the streets, desecration of her mother’s grave, and was hounded out of her home in Stafford. However police dropped the investigation into the alleged harassment claim as they could not find sufficient evidence. In 2012 Bailey authored a book called \"From Ward to Whitehall: the Disaster at Mid Staffs Hospital\", the story of her fight for the truth to be uncovered about the deadly failings at Mid Staffs Hospital and her struggle to ensure that the tragedy would never be repeated.

He then went to England, and entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn in November 1856; and, after winning a certificate of honour in May 1859, he was called to the bar in November of the same year. Having returned to Australia, Innes was admitted to the New South Wales bar in 1862, and practised till 1865, when he was appointed a district judge in Queensland. This position he resigned in 1869, and returned to practise his profession in Sydney. He also went into politics, and was returned to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Mudgee on 7 March 1872, in May of which year he became Solicitor-General in the first Parkes ministry, and in November of the next year Attorney-General in succession to Edward Butler. Having been nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1873, he continued to hold office as Attorney-General in the Parkes Ministry until the break-up of the Government in February 1875. In the previous year he had accompanied Sir Hercules Robinson, the then Governor of New South Wales, on his special mission to Fiji, in connection with the annexation of the island to the British Crown, and was knighted in January 1875 in recognition of his legal services on that occasion. Sir George acted as Chairman of Committees in the Legislative Council till August 1880, when he succeeded Francis Bathurst Suttor as Minister of Justice in the third Parkes ministry, this post he resigned in October 1881, on being appointed a Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

  "text" : "John Alexander Jackson (1809 – 25 May 1885) was a public servant, colonial agent in pre-Federation Australia and Treasurer of South Australia. Jackson was the son of John Serocold Jackson, a major in the 72nd Regiment. The family migrated to Sydney, New South Wales in July 1825. J.A. Jackson was employed as a draughtsman in the Surveyor-General's Department on a salary of £100. After apparently visiting England, he arrived in Launceston aboard the David Owen in June 1831. He owned two large farms, and in 1833, became the editor of John Pascoe Fawkner's Launceston Advertiser. Jackson was recommended by Sir John Franklin to the Government of South Australia, and was Treasurer in the early days of that colony and Colonial Secretary (succeeding Mr. Robert Gouger) from October 1841 to June 1843, when he resigned owing to a difference with the Governor of the colony, Captain (later Sir) George Grey. Jackson was a nominated member of the South Australian Legislative Council. Returning to Tasmania, he went to London as the official representative of the anti-transportation movement, and contributed towards the success of the agitation for granting responsible government to the Australian colonies by his letters to Earl Grey. It was due to an intimation received from Jackson whilst in London in 1849 that the people of Port Phillip District became aware of the intention of the imperial authorities to despatch a batch of convicts to their settlement. They were thus enabled to initiate the opposition which was successful in preventing Victoria becoming a convict colony. Later on Jackson resided in Melbourne as general manager of the English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank, a post which he held till replaced by Mr. (later Sir) George Verdon in 1872. Mr. Jackson married a daughter of the late W. G. Walker, of Vron Estate, Bishopsbourne, Tasmania, and died at Ealing, near London, in May 1885."

  "text" : "Jenn Shelton (born 1983) is an American ultramarathoner. She has set course records in several of the most demanding American ultramarathons. Shelton attended the University of North Carolina where she played on the rugby team. She dropped out to focus on writing poetry, but later enrolled at Old Dominion University. Shortly after Shelton began running ultramarathons she won several races and soon became one of the top female ultrarunners in the United States. She often runs in lightweight minimalist running shoes. In 2006, she traveled with Scott Jurek, Christopher McDougall, and several other ultrarunners as the sole female runner to Copper Canyon in the remote southwestern part of the state of Chihuahua in Mexico to run with the Tarahumara, for McDougall's book Born to Run. While running through a remote area during the trip she became separated from the group and was found severely dehydrated several hours later by a search crew. She has criticized the book's accounts of the Tarahumara people for \"romanticizing\" their lifestyle and for not adequately describing their poverty. In May 2007 she gained publicity by being the first woman at the Frederick Marathon in a women’s course record of 2 hours 53 minutes 44, racing in a bikini rather than conventional running kit. In July 2010 Shelton won the Deseret News Marathon in a time of 2:54:23. She says that she finds marathons more challenging to run than ultramarathons. Shelton has said that she intends to run more marathons and shorter races, citing a desire to run faster races. She is sponsored by Patagonia and competed in the 2012 U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials, but suffered a hamstring injury and did not finish."

  "text" : "James Bernard (11 April 1874 - 5 March 1946) was a reciter, elocutionist, author, Primitive Methodist and Unitarian lay preacher. Bernard was well known for his frequent radio broadcasts of 'character sketches' in the 1920s and early '30s (from early BBC studios; Manchester 2ZY and Savoy Hill in London) and as a foremost teacher of 'dramatic interpretation' in the North West of England. He performed works by Shakespeare and Dickens and popular authors of the day. On radio, he was remembered for his rendition of excerpts from Hardy's epic-drama of the war with Napoleon, The Dynasts (1924, 1926, 1930). He was Professor of Elocution at the Leeds College of Music from about 1911 to 1929 and, most influentially, at the Royal Manchester College of Music (RMCM) from 1929. From here and his studio in Lord Street (renamed White Oak Rd.), Fallowfield he taught a generation of northern actors. Following his death, he was succeeded at the RMCM (subsequently, the Royal Northern College of Music) by his student Sheila Barlow, MBE who through many successful years of collaboration with the Principal, Frederick Cox, developed the reputation of its Opera Department. For many years (1920 or earlier to about 1935), he also taught elocution at Hartley College, Manchester a major institution for training men for the Methodist ministry. Bernard is best remembered as tutor and mentor to stage and screen actor, Robert Donat. Donat began taking elocution lessons in 1918 (aged 12 years) after being enthralled by a recital performance of Dickens’ ‘A Christmas Carol’ given by Bernard in Rusholme, a suburb of south Manchester. Interviewed in 1934, Donat said modestly:‘Whatever success I may have gained has been entirely due to James Bernard, my elocution teacher in Manchester, who taught me all I know. He pushed me into my first stage job, and has always given me every possible help a man could give.’"

She became a well known figure in the folklore of her country and the subject of folk songs and legend. According to traditional legend, she was a part of the council of state. Johanne Andersdatter Sappi was the daughter of Anders Nielsen til Asdal and Ide Lydersdatter and the heir of one of the most powerful noble clans of Denmark. She first married the son of the chamberlain Bonde Due til Torp, who according to legend had her abducted. Widowed in 1430, she remarried Niels Eriksen til Vinstrup (d. 1447), by which she became the ancestral mother of the noble house Banner. She had four children during her first marriage, and fourteen during her second. By her wealth and her lands, as well as her personal qualities, she occupied a central place in the Danish nobility. The traditional legend that she was even given a place in the council of state, the riksråd, because of it is, however, not considered likely. However, in a document from 1462, she was given rank before the Bishop of Børglum, and mentioned as the bearer of the office Høvedsmand of Vendsyssel. She was a benefactor of Dueholm Abbey, where she died in 1479 and was buried."

His love of English cause him to return via a part-time degree in medieval studies and a never completed doctorates to teaching posts at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. A don of the old school he was resident in college and embraced the responsibility of teaching by tutorial readily, being far more concerned with inspiring and carefully inspiring those he taught and supervised than publications of his own. He was the editor of the Oxford Book of Classical Verse in Translation 1995 whilst a proposed private imprint for unpublished and out of print 17th century verse foundered for lack of finance. He had a huge circle of friends across the world, most of them scholars, and usually sported a full beard, which he deployed conversationally. Maule succumbed to complications arising from HIV infection. His funeral and memorial service were held in the chapel of Trinity College Cambridge where he was for the last decade of his life a Fellow, with many of those he taught and inspired taking part in the ceremonies. Maule is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge."

He spent three seasons playing for Riddell District Football League club Gisborne, which were coached by another brother, Bill. This meant he instead joined Melbourne, when he commenced his league career. Barham made four senior appearances for Melbourne in the 1981 VFL season and then played one game with Footscray in 1982.

He was returned for Parramatta on 8 December 1860, and strongly supported the passing of the Robertson Land Bill. He was beaten at Parramatta in 1865, but on 27 June 1867 he re-entered the Assembly as member for Central Cumberland, and was twice elected Chairman of Committees. From February 1875 to March 1877, he was Minister of Works in the Robertson Ministry, and again in the Parkes-Robertson Administration from December 1878 to January 1883. He was nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council in December 1885, and in August 1892 was appointed President of the Legislative Council in succession to Sir John Hay.

He is credited with transforming Orangina from a little known citrus soda first manufactured by his father, Léon Beton, into a major global brand. Beton launched Orangina's iconic, signature 8-ounce bottle in 1951, which became a symbol of the brand. The bottle is shaped like an orange, with a glass texture designed to mimic the fruit. In 2009, Beton called Orangina the \"champagne of soft drinks,\" saying that \"It doesn’t contain added colorants. It was and still is slightly sparkling. It had a little bulby bottle.\""

  "text" : "Janet Lembke (2 March 1933 – 3 September 2013), née Janet Nutt, was an American author, essayist, naturalist, translator and scholar. She was born in Cleveland, Ohio during the Great Depression, graduated in 1953 from Middlebury College, Vermont, with a degree in Classics, and her knowledge of the classical Greek and Latin worldview, from Homer to Virgil, informed her life and work. A Certified Virginia Master Gardener, she lived in Virginia and North Carolina, drawing inspiration from both locales. She was recognized for her creative view of natural cycles, agriculture and of animals, both domestic and wild, with whom we share the natural environment. Referred to as an \"acclaimed Southern naturalist,\" she was equally (as The Chicago Tribune described her) a \"classicist, a noted Oxford University Press translator of the works of Sophocles, Euripides and Aeschylus\". She received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to translate Virgil's Georgics, having already translated Euripides’ Electra and Hecuba, and Aeschylus’s Persians and Suppliants. Janet Lembke's first book was Bronze and Iron: Old Latin Poetry from Its Beginnings to 100 B.C. (1973), but beyond translations and essays about classics, there were more than a dozen books on nature, works for which the author acquired a base of admirers. Her articles were printed in The New York Times, Sierra Magazine (The Sierra Club), Oxford American, Audubon, Raleigh News and Observer, Southern Review and other publications. The writing style was eclectic and personal, meditative and detailed, and though she was at least once accused of \"taking poetic license too far\" in her translation of Georgics, readers were often charmed and seduced by her way of weaving scientific fact, history and culture, with personal anecdote, mythological allusion and poetic feeling. \"The author's ability to pull together disparate elements in her writing is impressive, and her passionate connection with the natural world is displayed in line after line,\" wrote The New York Times. Novelist Annie Proulx expressed a similar perception, observing that “Lembke’s writing tacks between three points: the stuff of her late-twentieth-century life; the tangle of creature and plant in every dimension of tide and river flow; and the haunting, connecting wires of mythos that still knot us to the ancient beginnings.” Among Janet Lembke's noted titles were Because the Cat Purrs: How We Relate to Other Species and Why It Matters (2008); Skinny Dipping: And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human (2004); Dangerous Birds (1996); River Time (1997); Despicable Species: On Cowbirds, Kudzu, Hornworms, and Other Scourges (1999); and The Quality of Life: Living Well, Dying Well (2004)-- a sober and unflinching account of the death of the author's mother. At the time of her own death at age 80 in Staunton, Virginia, Janet Lembke was working on a memoir, I Married an Arsonist. She had married twice, and had four children and six grandchildren. There is a repository of archived materials (\"The Janet Lembke Papers, 1966 - 2008\"), including notes and correspondence by the author, at the Jackson Library of the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC."

  "text" : "Sir James MacBain (19 April 1828 – 4 November 1892) KCMG, was a politician in colonial Victoria (Australia), President of the Victorian Legislative Council. MacBain was the youngest son of Smith MacBain, of Invergordon, Ross-shire, Scotland, and was born at Kinrhive in that county in 1828. He served a business apprenticeship in Inverness. In 1853 he married Jessie Smith, youngest daughter of William Smith, of Forres, and sister of the late Duncan Smith, manager of the Oriental Bank Corporation at Bombay. Immediately afterwards MacBain came to Melbourne, where he entered the service of the Bank of New South Wales. He quit shortly after and became partner in Melbourne of the mercantile and squatting agency firm of Gibbs, Ronald & Co. In 1863 he became a partner in the Geelong and London business of that firm, and of Richard Gibbs & Co., of London. In 1865 Geelong and London was sold to the Australian Mortgage, Land and Finance Company, Limited, of the Australian Board of which Sir James was chairman. Sir James was a member of the Council, and a trustee of both the Ormond College, affiliated to Melbourne University, and of the Working Men's College, Melbourne. He was also a trustee of the Scotch College and the Ladies' Presbyterian College, and of the Public Library and National Gallery in that city. Sir James represented the Wimmera district in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1864 to 1880, and in 1880 was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council for the Central province. He was a member of the Bryan O'Loghlen Government without portfolio from August 1881 to March 1883, in which year he visited Europe and acted as chairman of the Victorian Commission at the Amsterdam Exhibition. In the next year Sir James McBain was elected for the South Yarra Province, and succeeded Sir William Henry Fancourt Mitchell as President of the Victorian Legislative Council, from 27 November 1884 to 8 November 1892. He was knighted in May 1886, and having in the meantime acted as president or the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, was created K.C.M.G. in 1889. MacBain died in Toorak, Melbourne on 4 November 1892."

  "text" : "John Ernest Greaves CBE (30 November 1847 – 27 February 1945) was a wealthy Welsh slate mine owner and Lord Lieutenant of Caernarvonshire. He was born on 30 November 1847 at Tan-yr-allt, Tremadog, the son of John Whitehead Greaves, who had developed the slate industry in the area. He spent much of his childhood at Llechwedd, where his father had created the Llechwedd slate mine and was educated at schools in Warwickshire, Edinburgh and Dorset before going to Worcester College, Oxford. On his father's death he inherited a half share in the business and made his brother Richard Methuen Greaves the General Manager. They later turned the business into a limited company with himself as Chairman and his brother as Managing Director. He was appointed High Sheriff of Merionethshire for 1884 and for Caernarvonshire for 1885. He was also a Deputy Lieutenant for Caernarvonshire. In 1886 he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Caernarvonshire, the first commoner to hold the position, serving until 1933. He had inherited the family home at Bron Eifiod, near Criccieth, but in 1893 also bought the Glan Gwna estate near Caernarfon, rebuilding the hall. He was very involved in public affairs, including President of the North Wales branch of the NSPCC, Chairman of the Quarter Sessions and Alderman of Caernarvon County Council. He had a particular interest in nursing standards and from 1898 was on the Council of Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute for Nurses and was Chairman of the North Wales Nursing Association. He died on 27 February 1945. He had married Marianne Rigby (1851-1934), with whom he had a daughter Dorothy (1876-1963). He left Glan Gwna to Dorothy's elder daughter, also Dorothy (1906-1966), who in 1930 in Fiji had married William Stanley Flower (1902-1940), elder son of Stanley Smyth Flower."

McKean was born in Belfast, Ireland, the son of Rev. David McKean and his wife Sarah, née Smith. McKean emigrated to Victoria about 1854, and experienced a variety of the ups and downs of colonial life. In 1863 he was admitted a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria, and practised in Melbourne. Mackay was returned to the Victorian Assembly for Maryborough in February 1866, holding the seat until January 1871, and was President of the Board of Land & Works and commissioner Crown Lands & Survey from 20 September 1869 to 9 April 1870 in the John Alexander MacPherson Ministry. McKean was elected to North Gipps Land in a May 1875 by-election. During the prevalence of the \"Stonewall\" agitation, in 1876, McKean was committed to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms for disorderly conduct in defying the closure rule, and was ultimately expelled the House in June 1876 for some uncomplimentary references to his fellow-members of the Assembly, made whilst conducting a police court case. McKean was subsequently again elected for North Gipps Land in May 1880, but was defeated at the general election in February 1883, and did not re-enter parliament, though he contested Collingwood in June 1892 and 1894. McKean died in East Melbourne on 12 June 1901."

  "text" : "James Tannock Mackelvie (1824–1885) was a New Zealand philanthropist who donated a substantial art collection to the Auckland Art Gallery. Mackelvie established a perpetual memorial for himself in Auckland, New Zealand, by his endowment of that city with a valuable art collection selected by himself in Europe, and a rich bequest for the maintenance of a permanent gallery. To further this purpose the Municipal Corporation, in September 1891, resolved to erect a Mackelvie annexe to the handsome building, in which the Grey Literary Collection and the Auckland Free Public Library are placed. Mackelvie in early life was engaged as supercargo of a vessel during the Crimean War, and subsequently as purser on an Atlantic liner. Leaving the sea, he obtained an appointment in a large mercantile house in London, and was so engaged in 1865, when Dr. Campbell, desiring a partner to take charge of his business while he visited Europe, entered into an agreement with Mackelvie, who came to Auckland and assumed the direction of the business of Messrs. Brown, Campbell & Co. until 1870, when the partnership terminated by effluxion of time. During that short period, however, Mackelvie had amassed a fortune by means of judicious mining investments on the Thames goldfields. He returned to Europe a month or two after quitting his connection with Brown, Campbell & Co., and lived in retirement, employing a large part of his time in collecting the art treasures which he had resolved to bequeath to the city where his fortune was made. Many valuable paintings and sketches were forwarded to Auckland during his lifetime, and at his death, which took place on 4 June 1885, by the terms of his will, after providing for about £35,000 legacies, in some of which the trustees have a reversionary interest, the balance of the estate was left in trust for the people of Auckland. The legacy, owing to the great depreciation in all kinds of property, is very much less than the testator no doubt intended, but, including the reversionary interest in legacies, the trustees hope the amount may not be far short of £30,000, besides the valuable collection now in the Art Gallery. During his stay in the colony Mackelvie was director of the Bank of New Zealand, the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Company, and other companies."

  "text" : "John Medex Maddox (1789–1861) was a Victorian-era playwright and one-time manager of the Princess's Theatre in London's Oxford Street. Of Jewish descent, Maddox had been born John Medex and used \"Maddox\" as an ornamental suffix. His brother, Samuel Medex kept a cigar shop directly opposite the Princess's Theatre and his premises became something of a meeting point for London's actors and playwrights. Until taking over the Princesses Theatre in 1842, Maddox had led a roving life as stage-manager, acting-manager, and agent. He had also enjoyed a brief spell as manager of London's Colosseum theatre. Charles, Duke of Brunswick, an exiled German aristocrat and London character, lent Maddox the cash to tide him over during the first few months of his management. His first productions at the Princesses were the opera La Sonnambula and an Oriental burlesque. The chief feature of Maddox's reign were English versions of Italian operas, with productions of Anna Bolena, Lucia di Lammermoor, Otello, I puritani and Lucrezia Borgia. Maddox prospered, and gradually enlarged his sphere of operations. The first English version of the French vaudeville, L'homme Blesse, was brought out at the Princesses in 1842-43, after which he staged Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide extravaganzas, but shrank from the financial risk of a Christmas pantomime. He was not averse to paying good salaries to first-rate English comedians—in particular Mr. and Mrs. Keeley who drew huge crowds to the theatre. Robert Keeley eventually took over as co-manager with Charles Kean after Maddox retired. Maddox was also a prolific playwright and authored a number of dramas and farces, as well as sub-contracting work to a number of hack writers and translators. It was reputed that he was in the habit of locking up his them up in a garret at the theatre, leaving them just enough cold meat, bread and alcohol as was necessary, and not releasing them until they had finished the work he had paid them for. One of his earlier protégés was George Augustus Sala who undertook scene-painting for the theatre and later found a degree of fame writing pieces for Charles Dickens' Household Words."

  "text" : "Jack Laxer (born 1927) is an American photographer best known for his work in stereoscopy. His photographs of California modern architecture have been published in magazines and books, displayed in museums, and included in educational programs since the 1950s. He photographed the homes of Lucille Ball and Harold Lloyd with the Stereo Realist camera. His clients included the architects Paul Revere Williams, William F. Cody, Arthur Froehlich, Ladd & Kelsey, and Armet & Davis, best known for their Googie coffee shops. Beginning in 1951 he documented the designs of Louis Armet and Eldon Davis including Norms, Pann’s, and the Holiday Bowl. These images were included in Alan Hess’s book Googie: Fifties Coffee Shop Architecture, setting off a revival of interest in the style beginning in the 1980s. The Los Angeles Conservancy Modern Committee exhibited Laxer’s photography in 1993 in an exhibition about the work of Armet & Davis at the Union Oil Center. In 2001 the group projected them in 3-D at the California Science Center. In 2009 DKRM Gallery in Los Angeles exhibited his work in the solo show Ultra-Angeles: Kodachrome in 3-D. Laxer taught a course at the Getty Museum in 2010 called Modernism in 3-D: The Art of Stereo Photography. The Chinese American Museum exhibited his 3D work in specially built viewers as part of their 2012 exhibit Breaking Ground: Chinese American Architects in Los Angeles. The Getty Museum included Laxer’s work (the only stereo photos) in the exhibit and publication Overdrive: L.A. Constructs The Future, which ran as part of the museum’s Pacific Standard Time series before relocating to the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. in October 2013. The Los Angeles Conservancy presented Laxer with the Modern Master award in 2009."

Muscia, also known as the Fileteador of Tango, distinguishes himself for being a force in the revival of this old style of painting and for being a renowned instructor and promoter of the filete art in Argentina and the world. Regarding his work, both tango [Jorge Muscia , pintor y escultor, ha realizado una amplísima obra, también en Europa, ya considerado verdadero Maestro de este arte hermano plástico del Tango. Horacio Ferrer, poeta e historiador, para Oratorio Carlos Gardel, 1990.] historians as well as art ['El fileteado sacó carta de ciudadanía argentina en el Abasto porteño.

  "text" : "John Chew Young (Chinese: 容兆珍 Pinyin: Rong Zhaozhen. June 16, 1912 – October 27, 1987), Chinese American, was born in San Jose, California. A key figure in the development of Chinatown, San Francisco, he was one of the original board members of the Chinese Historical Society of America, and a decorated American WWII army veteran of the China Burma India Theater. Celebrated as one of the 20 individuals from San Francisco history \"who was heroic in stature and who contributed significantly to the building of the San Francisco we know today.\"John C. Young was the second son of Mr. and Mrs. Young Soong Quong. John's father came to America at the age of 11 and was a resident of California since 1881. John grew up in San Jose Chinatown and attended public schools in San Jose. After graduating in engineering from Stanford University in 1937, he married Mary Lee Young (Chinese: 李心如 Pinyin: Li Ruxin. December 1, 1908 - January 14, 2002), a San Francisco born Chinese American, and they had three children: Janey Young Cheu, Connie Young Yu, and Alfred John Young. Commissioned in the United States Army at the outbreak of World War II, Young served in the China Burma India Theater—initially to organize the airdrop of supplies to troops and to Dr. Gordon Seagrave, \"the Burma Surgeon\"; and then as a member of the liaison group under General Joseph Stilwell. Young spent more than two years along the Burma Road, training and advising Chinese troops in ordnance activities and participated in the Salween campaign. At the Battle of Mount Song (Songshan Mountain), he and other U.S. Army engineers (Peter S. Hopkins and Carlos Spaht), helped design and implement the strategy of tunneling and placing TNT charges that destroyed the core of that Japanese stronghold. After the road was opened, he helped equip the Chinese armies with new American weapons. \"John Young was awarded one of China's highest decorations, the Grand Order of the Cloud and Banner, for his aid in opening the man-made, 1,000 mile lifeline. For his service as a U.S. Army Combat Liaison Officer in WWII, he was awarded the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal. (Military Record and Report of Separation, Certificate of Service, National Personnel Records Center, 29 Dec 45.) \"After graduating in engineering from Stanford University in 1937, John Young became active as a businessman and consultant in San Francisco. Commissioned in the United States Army at the outbreak of World War II, Young served in the China Burma India Theater as a liaison officer between Chinese and American Troops. Leaving the service with the rank of a major, Young returned to San Francisco to run his own manufacturing business and to serve on the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. For more than thirty years, Young devoted himself to the improvement of San Francisco's Chinatown. Among other things, he helped found the annual Chinese New Year's Parade (and the Miss Chinatown USA Pageant), worked for low-cost federal housing in Chinatown, and worked with city government to upgrade the Chinatown infrastructure. Rising to the rank of colonel in the United States Army Reserve, Young played an important role in the Chinese-American Veterans' affairs, including the establishment of a memorial to Chinese veterans of World War II placed in St. Mary's Square.\" John C. Young and his brother-in-law, George Hall \"....set up the first factory in the United States that manufactured soy sauce (Wing Nien Brand) using the old Chinese fermentation process.\" They organized the U.S. Enterprise Corporation which handled property development, import, and exporting. Young and Hall also were part owners with Johnny Kan in Kan's Restaurant, as well as Hakone Gardens, Saratoga, California. After George Hall's death in 1966, John C. Young became president of the U.S. Enterprise Corporation and headed Wing Nien Soy Sauce Co. until his retirement in 1977. As a commander of the American Legion Post #384 (Cathay Post), Col. Young helped to establish the San Francisco memorial to the fallen Chinese American Veterans of WWI and WWII, and along with his former commanding officer, General Albert Wedemeyer, helped to preside over its dedication. During the Korean War, Young was recalled to active duty and served as the chief of the Inspection Division of the San Francisco Ordnance District from 1951–53. He retired as a reserve officer in June of 1972 with the rank of full colonel. Col. Young and his wife Mary donated their extensive collection of Chinese Imperial Robes and Chinese jade to the Stanford University Cantor Center for Visual Arts and to the Tacoma Art Museum. Shortly after Col. Young's death, Mary funded the building of a museum in China near Young's father's ancestral village in Doumen District, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. The museum bears Col. Young's Chinese name: The Zhaozhen Museum."

  "text" : "Josef Wolfsthal (12 June 1899 – 3 February 1931), born as Josef Wolfthal, was an Austrian violinist and a professor in Germany's capital Berlin. He was born into a musical family in Vienna. It was of Galician origin. His father and his older brother Max (* 1896) both played the violin. His father was an excellent violin teacher, and gave his sons their first lessons on that instrument. He also taught Sigmund Feuermann (1900–1952). From the age of 10, Wolfsthal studied for six years with famed Hungarian violin teacher Carl Flesch, and at age 16 started to perform in public. His debut was on April 7, 1916 with Berliner Philharmoniker conducted by Camillo Hildebrand (1876–1953). There he performed the Concerto for 2 Violins in D minor, BWV 1043 by Johann Sebastian Bach with his teacher Carl Flesch, who then encouraged him to gain some experience as an orchestral player to make him a more disciplined ensemble player. In that capacity, he played in the first performance of Ein Heldenleben by Richard Strauss, and in the first recording of Molière's Le bourgeois gentilhomme by Strauss, conducted by the composer in Berlin (see below). Wolfsthal then moved to Bremen, where he succeeded Georg Kulenkampff (1898–1948) as concertmaster. Later he moved to the Swedish capital Stockholm and then back to Berlin as concertmaster of one of the two outstanding orchestras in the German capital in the interwar period, the Berlin State Opera orchestra (the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra was the other), where he became a protégé of Richard Strauss, who often conducted this orchestra (see above). When he was only 26, he was made a violin professor at Music Academy in Berlin. Some of his students were Szymon Goldberg (1909–1993) and Marianne Liedtke, who later named herself Maria Lidka (1914–2013) after emigrating to United Kingdom. Wolfsthal gave the premiere of Karl Weigl's 1928 Violin Concerto. He played in a distinguished string trio with cellist Emmanuel Feuermann and violist and composer Paul Hindemith in which his pupil Goldberg succeeded him after his death and led the group in recordings for Columbia of Beethoven's Serenade Op. 8 and Hindemith's String Trio No. 2. Wolfsthal had already made some recordings in the 1920s. In 1928, he became deputy head of orchestra of Krolloper Berlin, which was led by Otto Klemperer. There he took part in the premiere of Kammermusik No. 5, op. 36 no. 4 by Hindemith. He formed a trio with pianist Leonid Kreutzer and cellist Gregor Piatigorsky. The latter recommended him as a violin teacher to the young Marianne Liedtke. But when Wolfsthal was engaged to accompany young piano virtuoso Vladimir Horowitz, his lack of discipline betrayed him when, while performing for Piatigorsky's manager, he abruptly stopped accompanying in midstream and started to improvise, laughing boyishly. He married Olga, the former wife of George Szell, who bore him a daughter. After attending a funeral in Berlin in the winter of 1930, he caught a cold which escalated to pneumonia several weeks later and took his life at only 31. His wife later married the cellist Benar Heifetz (1899–1974), elder brother of renowned violinist Jascha Heifetz (1901-1987). Wolfsthal's sound has been described as \"tightly concentrated\" and \"sweet\"; his style—which eschewed portamenti—as having a \"spruce modernity\". Reviewing Wolfsthal's 1929 recording of Beethoven's Violin Concerto, the Penguin guide to compact discs wrote of his \"breathtaking mastery, making one regret that this pupil of Carl Flesch died in his early thirties.\""

In 1918, he transferred to the Australian Flying Corps and began flying training near Oxford in England. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in April 1919 and shortly afterwards was promoted lieutenant. After the end of the war, the Australian government offered a prize of £10,000 for the first flight from England to Australia. He paired with another Australian Flying Corps officer, Ray Parer, and, although leaving well after the event had been won, they arrived in Darwin on 2 August 1920. Their aircraft was an Airco DH-9, and theirs was the only other entrant to successfully complete the race. He and Parer were awarded the Air Force Cross for this feat on 23 November 1920, as well as £500 each. In 1921, McIntosh was killed in an air crash near Pithara, Western Australia. It was the first fatal air crash in the state."

Promoted to Lieutenant in 1731 and received promotions to Lieutenant-Captain (1739), Captain (1740), Major (1754), and Lieutenant-Colonel (1758). Appointed to the Nova Scotia Council at Annapolis Royal in 1736 and granted the position of Justice of the Peace by Governor Peregrine Hopson in 1752. During Father Le Loutre's War, Captain Handfield was first in command of Fort Vieux Logis (1749); successfully defending the fort during the Siege of Grand Pre, while losing his son and future son-in-law Captain John Hamilton who were taken prisoner by the Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias. In 1750 he was commander at Fort Anne, Annapolis Royal. He took command at Fort Lawrence where he married John Hamilton (British army officer) to his daughter (1752). Through his marriage to Acadian Elizabeth Winniet (sister of Joseph Winniett, both of whom were grandchildren of Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste), John was related to many Acadians and thus found carrying out his duties to deport the Acadians at Annapolis disagreeable. In a letter to John Winslow he states, “I heartily join with You in wishing that we were both of us got over this most disagreeable and troublesome part of the Service.” In 1758 he fought at the Siege of Louisbourg, retiring from His majesty's service in 1760. He moves to Boston upon his retirement and by 1776 is found in Ireland where he dies at Waterford on April 20, 1787."

  "text" : "Julia Bullard Nelson (1842–1914) was an American temperance and women's rights activist from Red Wing, Minnesota. Following the death of her husband and their only child, she bravely headed south to Texas in 1869 to teach former slaves in U.S. government-backed Freedmen's Bureau schools. Nelson spent the summers of the 1870s and 1880s in Minnesota, where she emerged as a state and national leader in the movement for women's suffrage and the temperance campaign against alcohol use. Born in High Ridge, Connecticut, on May 13, 1842, Julia Bullard moved to Minnesota with her family in 1857. She earned a teaching degree at Hamline University around 1862 and then relocated to Red Wing. In 1866 Julia married former classmate Ole Nelson. Tragedy struck the Nelsons when their infant son, Cyrus, died in August, 1867. Just five months later, Ole died. Newly widowed, the twenty-six-year-old teacher decided to put her teaching skills to use for a greater cause: educating newly freed slaves in the South. In 1869, Nelson chose a dangerous task. She traveled to Texas where she would teach freed slaves through the Freedmen's Bureau. Congress created the Freedmen's Bureau to assist newly freed slaves to adjust to their release following the Civil War. By 1869 there were some three thousand schools for freed men and women, including the one at which Nelson taught. Most Southern whites, angry at their defeat during the Civil War (1861–1865), deeply resented teachers from the North. Although she was threatened with violence and shunned by some whites, Nelson taught in the South from 1870 until 1888. In the early 1880s, Nelson, a member of the Minnesota Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), assumed duty as a public speaker for the group. She also worked as superintendent for the state WCTU and was its vice president. She handled editing the group's newspaper, the Minnesota White Ribboner. \"Julia B.\" made good use of summers free from teaching duty. In 1881 she joined fourteen other women, including Dr. Martha George Ripley, in forming the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association (MWSA). The MWSA led the state effort to allow women to vote, a right denied them when the United States was formed. An excellent public speaker, Nelson became one of the group's most sought-after orators. She became a paid lecturer for the National Woman Suffrage Association. Julia B., now a Red Wing resident, served as MWSA president from 1890 to 1896. President Nelson allied the MWSA with Ignatius Donnelly in 1893. Donnelly, a well-known Minnesota politician and famed orator, believed in a woman's right to vote. Nelson, Donnelly, and their allies, persuaded the Minnesota Senate to consider a suffrage amendment to the constitution. By a thirty-two to nineteen margin, the Senate voted to drop the word \"male\" from voting requirement language. But the bill did not become a law, because the House, under time constraints, did not vote on it. The MWSA continued to bring their amendment before future legislatures without success. Her heavy schedule convinced Nelson to recruit twenty-one-year-old Jeremiah Patterson, a freed slave and former student, to run her Belvidere farm south of Red Wing. Patterson became part of the community. He married Verna Gaylord and moved to the Red Wing. In spring 1897, Nelson and Patterson opened the Equal Rights Meat Market. This black–white business partnership, most rare in Minnesota at this time, proved unsuccessful, but the Pattersons and their children continued to live in Red Wing. They stayed friends with Julia. Julia B. Nelson continued her demanding work, but by the winter of 1912, at age seventy-one, she was feeling the effects of bronchitis. In 1913 her physician suggested a long rest in Florida, and she followed his advice. But on her way south she stopped in Washington, D.C. to attend the national woman's suffrage convention. Nelson could not resist working, and in late fall 1914, started a strenuous train tour of North Dakota, working for women's voting rights. Weakened by this effort, Nelson died of pneumonia on December 24, 1914. A newspaper article reported she was \"The Last of the Grand Old Women of Suffrage.\""

MacSween came from a family of butchers in Edinburgh, where he noted the popularity of haggis among English rugby fans attending international matches at Murrayfield Stadium. After taking over the family business in 1975, the subsequent popularity of their haggis led to his opening the world's first purpose-built haggis factory, and the sale of the butchers company. In the 1970s MacSween took his haggis to London, and soon received orders for MacSween haggis from the luxury department stores Selfridges, Harrods, and Fortnum & Mason. MacSween started to produce what was described as a vegetarian haggis in 1984, after a request from the Burns Supper at the Scottish Poetry Library. MacSween married Kate Mackay, in 1964, she was the daughter of a former Lord Provost of Edinburgh. His wife and his four children survived him at this death, and MacSween haggis continued to be produced."

  "text" : "Sir John Jeffreyson (1635-1700) was an English-born judge whose entire judicial career was spent in Ireland; he was unusual among Irish judges of the time in holding the rank of English Serjeant-at-law. He was considered an outstanding lawyer, and was noted for his staunchly Tory politics. He was born in Durham, son of John Jeffreyson, a mercer, and Margaret Walton. He went to school in Guisborough and matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge in 1652. He entered Gray's Inn in 1651 and was called to the Bar in 1661. He became Recorder of Durham in 1679, bencher of Gray's Inn in 1682 and Serjeant in 1683. He was a staunch Tory in politics and a close friend of the noted loyalist Thomas Cartwight, Bishop of Chester, but after the Glorious Revolution, unlike Bishop Cartwright, he did not follow King James II into exile. He strongly supported the King's policy of religious toleration, and was recommended for promotion to the High Court bench in 1688 as a reward for his good service to the Crown. His career was not permanently damaged by the Glorious Revolution. Perhaps surprisingly, given his record of loyalty to the previous regime, he was sent to Ireland as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) in 1690: presumably his long experience and legal ability were thought to outweigh his Tory opinions. He joined the King's Inn and was knighted in 1692: he was made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1693. His political views led to conflict at a time when the Irish Bench was riven with political differences: he was removed from the Privy Council in 1695 but restored to his place on it in 1697. In the same year he acted as Commissioner of the Great Seal of Ireland. He died in 1700 and was buried in St. Peter's Church, Aungier Street, Dublin (which was demolished in 1983.). He married Elizabeth Cole of Gateshead in 1664; they had one daughter, Margaret, who married Captain Walker. Margaret was a friend of the Irish-born author, Mary Davys, who dedicated her first novel, The Amours of Alcippus and Lucippe, later renamed The Lady's Tale (1704) to Margaret. Mrs Davys in the dedication praises Margaret's \"unexceptional temper\", and refers to their old acquaintance in England, suggesting that their friendship was of long standing.. Elrington Ball described Jeffreyson as a fine lawyer, but a Tory above all ."

The seat had opened when the Democrat Paul Bookout of Jonesboro, reelected in 2012 and a former Senate President, resigned in the summer of 2013 under an ethics cloud. With a turnout of approximately 17 percent in the special election, Cooper defeated the Democratic nominee, Steven Eric Rockwell (born 1954), 4,314 (57.2 percent) to 3,227 (42.8 percent). Rockwell manages his family printing and publishing business in Jonesboro and called himself a \"centrist\" in the race. Retiring Democratic Governor Mike Beebe cut ads for the Rockwell campaign. Cooper first defeated two fellow Republicans, Chad Niell and Dan Sullivan, to gain his party endorsement. Cooper also carried the support of the Tea Party movement. Until Bookout's resignation, Cooper had intended to run in 2014 for the District 59 seat in the Arkansas House of Representatives. He lost a race in 2012 for that same House seat against the Democrat Butch Wilkins, who was term-limited in 2014. Cooper became the 23rd Republican in the 35-member Arkansas Senate, which had been 100 percent Democratic until 1969, when Jim Caldwell, a minister from Rogers, won election the previous November in a district based about Benton and Carroll counties in northwestern Arkansas. In the campaign, Cooper said that he considers ethics reform and wasteful government spending among his legislative priorities."

Birchenough was a Liberal Unionist and served as Mayor of Macclesfield Town in 1875-76. His portrait hangs in Macclesfield old Town Hall."

After spending several years in France, he returned to the South Pacific in 1874 as a plant collector in the employ of Belgian horticulturist Jean Jules Linden. In 1877, he died in New Caledonia in an area between La Foa and Moindou. Many of the plants that he collected from the Pacific were further examined by other botanists that included Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart and Jean Antoine Arthur Gris. The genus Pancheria (family Cunoniaceae) is named after him, as are taxa with the specific epithet of pancheri, an example being  Acmopyle pancheri."

He was the organiser of the Blockade Department during the First World War and was Assistant Director for Commercial Affairs from May 1919 to October 1924. He was then Deputy Director of Political and Commercial Affairs from until December 1926. He was estimated by his colleagues as the most creative thinker on political matters and he wrote every major paper on economics at the Foreign Ministry for eight years. During the 1920s he was the chief reparations expert on the French side and was firmly in favour of Franco-German economic rapprochement. The historian Stephen Schuker called Seydoux \"by far the most lucid mind among senior French bureaucrats in the 1920s...self-effacing, nonpolitical, but independent-minded who put his expertise at the service of the most diverse political superiors and managed to win the admiration of them all\"."

Cohen received his M.D and Ph.D in nutrition from the Paris Diderot University in 1983, after which he worked as a nutritional consultant for a research laboratory from 1982-1986. In 1986, he founded one of the first poly-disciplinary consultation centers in the Paris region. He wrote his first book, Savoir Maigrir (Know How to Lose Weight), published by Groupe Flammarion, in 2002. In 2004, Cohen was awarded the French National Order of Merit for his contributions in implementing a nutritional label system in France.In 2007, Savoir Maigrir was adapted as an online weight loss coaching program.In 2011, Cohen critiqued the Dukan Diet, saying that the low-carb diet was dangerous and could lead to long-term problems. Pierre Dukan, the diet's founder, sued Cohen for libel, but lost the case.In 2012, Cohen released his first book in English, The Parisian Diet: How to Reach Your Right Weight and Stay There, along with its online version. Cohen frequently appears on TV shows in France as a nutrition expert. He is married to Myriam Cohen, and together, they have three children."

  "text" : "Sir James Harrington, KB, MP of Hornby (?1430 - 22 August 1485) was a prominent supporter of the House of York in Northern England during the Wars of the Roses, having been retained by Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, who was brother-in-law to the head of the House of York, Richard of York. He was second son of Sir Thomas Harrington, who had died with the king's father at the Battle of Wakefield in December 1460. James himself had fought with Salisbury at the Battle of Blore Heath in 1459, where he had been captured and imprisoned by the Lancastrians until the next year. He was a significant regional figure during the reign of King Edward IV, although the early years of the new king's reign were mared by a bitter feud between him and the Stanley family over a castle in Lancashire. On the accession of King Richard III in 1485, he was appointed to the new king's Household, and as such was almost certainly with him at Battle of Bosworth two years later. It is likely that he fell in battle there, although precise details of his death are now unknown."

He had initially considered an army career or study of geography, but his poor skills in mathematics and drawing led him to turn to historical study. Pierre Renouvin's course fascinated him, and he became his assistant in 1945. He went on to teach at University of Saarbrücken from 1950 to 1957 and returned to the Sorbonne afterward. Duroselle's writings include La Decadence (1980), L'Abime (1985), and others. He was noted for his study of international relations and won a 1982 Balzan Prize for Social Sciences for his work."

  "text" : "Janice Light, holds the Hintz Family Endowed Chair in Children’s Communicative Competence in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at Pennsylvania State University. As a Distinguished Professor, she teaches graduate courses and seminars in augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) and has developed an internationally recognized research program in AAC. Janice Light's primary interest has been furthering understanding of the development of communicative competence, language, and literacy skills by individuals with complex communication needs who require AAC. Light has been the principal investigator on more than 20 federally funded research grants to improve outcomes for individuals who use AAC (totaling more than $10 million). She is currently the Principal Investigator for the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (RERC on AAC), a virtual research consortium funded by the National Institute for Disability and Rehabilitation Research. She is the author of more than 80 peer-reviewed papers, book chapters, and books,. Light was a co-editor of the journal Augmentative and Alternative Communication (the official journal of the International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication) with Dr. David McNaughton from 2012-2015. She has received numerous awards in recognition of her research and teaching contributions to the field, including the Don Johnston Distinguished Lecturer award from the International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication, the Dorothy Jones Barnes Outstanding Teaching Award, the Penn State Teaching Hall of Fame award, the Journal of Augmentative and Alternative Communication Editor's Award, the Helen G. and Evan G. Patishall Outstanding Research Achievement Award, the Pauline Schmitt Russell Distinguished Research Career Award, the Penn State University Faculty Scholar Medal for Outstanding Achievement in the Social and Behavioral Sciences, and the 2013 President’s Award for Academic Integration. Light's early work focused on the nature of interaction between persons who use AAC and their communication partners, and resulted in her proposal of a definition for communicative competence in AAC, including four social purposes of communicative interaction in AAC: the expression of needs and wants to a listener, the transfer of information as in more general conversation, the development of social closeness through such things as jokes and cheering, and finally social etiquette practices such as \"please\" and \"thank you\". These four purposes vary in terms of the relative importance of the content, rate, duration and the focus of the interaction. It is important that the AAC systems selected also reflect the priorities of the individual and their family. More recently, Light's work has focused on the development of communication systems for very young children with complex communication needs in order to support language and literacy needs, as well as work to support the translation of knowledge to practice in these areas"

  "text" : "Jennie Lee (c. 1854 – 3 May 1930), was an Victorian Era English stage actress, singer and dancer whose career was largely entwined with the title role in Jo, a melodrama her husband, John Pringle Burnett, wove around a relatively minor character from the Charles Dickens novel, Bleak House. She made her stage debut in London at an early age and found success in New York and San Francisco not long afterwards. Lee may have first starred in Jo around 1874 during her tenure at San Francisco's California Theatre, but her real success came with the play's London debut on 22 February 1876 at the Globe Theatre in Newcastle Street. Jo ran for many months at the Globe and other London venues before embarking for several seasons on tours of the British Isles, a return to North America, tours of Australia and New Zealand and later revivals in Britain. Reduced circumstances over her final years forced Lee to seek assistance from an actor's pension fund subsidized in part by proceeds from Royal Command Performances."

He published 4 books on biblical archaeology, including his 1940 book, Diggers for Facts, where he compared the archaeological scene of the 1940s to the works of ancient texts, where he argued strongly for the historical Exodus, dating it at 1486 BC, the Resurrection of Jesus, and against the story of Daniel in the Den of Lions. Kinnaman died on September 7, 1961, at the age of 84 in Stockton, California. He was survived by his wife, Flo Vera."

He subsequently devoted most of his remaining career as a songwriter to creating music for Catholic children. His Religious Music Guild produced two full-length LPs of these songs: Seven Songs on the Seven Sacraments and Twelve Songs on the Apostles' Creed."

  "text" : "June Schwarcz (née June Morris, June 10, 1918 in Denver – August 2, 2015) was an American enamel artist who creates tactile, expressive objects by applying technical mastery of her medium to vessel forms and plaques, which she considers nonfunctional sculpture. Schwarcz studied industrial design at Pratt Institute in New York from 1939 to 1941 and afterward created packages, greeting cards, textiles, and window displays in New York. In 1943 she married Leroy Schwarcz, an engineer whose work necessitated several moves. While visiting Denver en route to Sausalito in 1954, Schwarcz was introduced to enameling. She began creating enamels with pre-made metal forms but soon began pounding out her own, developing an expertise in the base-taille technique. When she moved to New Haven, Connecticut, in 1955, Schwarcz travelled to New York City to see examples of contemporary enamel. The curator of the Museum of Contemporary Crafts included her work in the museum's inaugural exhibition, Craftsmanship in a Changing World (1956), establishing her reputation. When Schwarcz moved to La Jolle later that year, she showed with the Allied Craftsmen of San Diego and received her first solo exhibition at the La Jolla Art Center (1957). That same year she returned to Sausalito. Beginning in 1962, Schwarcz used electroplating and electroforming to create more dramatic textures and varied shapes. Her innovative use of copper foil and mesh, which she started using in 1964, enables her to fold, cut, gather, and stitch to create unique, dynamic forms. Designated a Living Treasure of California in 1985, Schwarcz also received the James Renwick Alliance Masters of the Medium Award (2009). Since the late 1950s her work has appeared in numerous exhibitions and has been the subject of solo shows at the San Francisco Craft and Folk Art Museum (1998) and the Mingel International Museum in San Diego (2009–10)."

  "text" : "Josefa Texidor i Torres (also known as Pepita Texidor and Teixidor; 27 November 1875 - 8 February 1914) was a Catalan painter. Born in Barcelona in 1875, she was trained by her father, José Texidor Busquets, her brother, Modest Texidor Torres and later she studied under Francesc Miralles. Her brother wanted her to dedicate herself to the painting of portraits, but Pepita preferred, from the beginning, the use of watercolours and the painting of cultivated flowers. Pepita was trained in music, singing and painting and often travelled. She remained single and dedicated herself to family and charity work. She participated in many exhibitions in Barcelona and at the Exposition Universelle (Paris, 1900), where she was awarded a silver medal for her flower sprays in Springtime and Autumn. She was nominated an honorary member of the \"Union des femmes peintres et sculpteurs\". She died at the age of 39 in Barcelona in 1914, after a year of severe illness. On 21 May 1914 meetings began to commission a bust for the Parc de la Ciutadella. A tombola was held to raise funds through the sale of paintings by her father and brother, along with works from painters of the time, like Lluïsa Vidal, Isabel Baquero, Rafaela Sánchez Aroca, Visitació Ubach, Ramon Casas, Claudi Lorenzale, Santiago Rusiñol, Modest Urgell, Apel·les Mestres, etc.; and works also of dead artists, like Fortuny, Martí Alsina, Vayreda, etc. Apel·les Mestres dedicated a poem to her that he shared with all those who attended the inaugural act. The bust was designed by Manuel Fuxá and was inaugurated on 14 October 1917. (translated source ) In March 1909, La Vanguardia, reviewed a musical composition by Pepita Texidor - \"Lola\", a graceful habanera for the piano. She was praised for her 'refined talent' with both colours and sounds. The piece was edited by Musical Emporium and the cover was designed by Alexandre de Riquer with a female figure in dance pose.

Josefa served as general director of education in 1924, the first woman of Nicaragua to be given such an office. She graduated as one of the first from Colegio de Señoritas, the first secular college to admit women in Nicaragua, alongside among others Carmela Noguera. She was a leader of the women's rights movement in Nicaragua. She published several works about this issue, and also founded papers about this issue, the first one being Revista Femenina Ilustrada (1918). In 1920 she visited feminists in Cuba and the United States, including meeting with the suffragist Amelia Maiben de Ostolaza in Havana. In 1940 she published a series of essays called \"Feminism and Education.\""

As a player, he represented the Malaysian national football team in the 1950s, winning the first 2 Merdeka Tournaments in 1958 and 1959. After injury cut short his playing career, he turned into coaching. He was assistant coach of Malaysia under Dave McLaren from 1970 to 1971, and they guided Malaysia to success in the qualification to the 1972 Munich Olympics football competition. In the final tournament, Jalil takes over from McLaren and oversaw 1 win (3-0 against United States) and 2 defeats (0-3 against West Germany, 0-6 against Morocco) from 3 group games. Nevertheless, this remains one of the greatest achievements of Malaysia football as it is the only appearances of the national team in the Olympics. Later Jalil returned to coach Malaysia in 2 other stints: in 1974 Merdeka Tournament, and in 1981 after the failure of Malaysia in the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification under Karl Heinz Weigang. By profession, Jalil was a prison officer under Malaysian Prisons Department, and for most of his life was working in Taiping Prison, and was Prison Director at Simpang Renggam Prison.

  "text" : "John Kotelawala (known as John Kotelawala Snr ) (4 November 1864 – 20 April 1907) was a Ceylonese police officer and businessmen. He was known for the murder of Francis Dixon Attygalle, which became the first sensational murder trial in Ceylon. His son General Sir John Kotelawala was the 3rd Prime Minister of Ceylon. Born in Piliyandala to Don A Kotelawala, John joined the Ceylon Constabulary as a constable. He was later promoted to Inspector and was noted for raiding illegal gambling dens. He married Alice Attygalle the daughter of Mudaliyar Don Charles Gemoris Attygalle, a wealthy land and mine owner. They had three children, Sir John, Justin and Freda. Freda married C.V.S. Corea, her son was Dr Gamani Corea. After the death of Mudaliyar Attygalle, Kotelawala left the police service and took over the management of the Mudaliyar Attygalle's estate. He was forced out of managing the estate after allegations of misappropriation and court cases filled by his mother in law in the Kurunegala District Court. Thereafter he formed the Ceylon-Japan Trading Co and set sail to Japan. On his return from Japan, he was arrested for orchestrating the murder of Francis Dixon Attygalle, his brother in law. Francis Attygalle was actually shot by Piloris a Boer War veteran who had served under Winston Churchill. Piloris turned Crown Witness and Kotelawala, his former police sergeants, Singhoni Perera and Baron Perera, were accused of murder in the Colombo Assizes court and all were found guilty. Kotelawala committed suicide before he was executed. He was also the President of the Carters Association of Colombo, following his death, the carters stormed the houses of the prosecutors, Acting Attorney General Walter Pereira, KC and Crown Counsel C. M. Fernando."

  "text" : "Jeffrey Steele (born 3 July 1931) is an abstract painter. In Paris (1959) he encountered the work of artists working in the mode of geometric abstraction, such as Victor Vasarely (1906–97), Max Bill (1908–94) and Josef Albers (1888–1976), and adopted a lifelong abstract approach. For eight years he worked purely in black and white and was identified with the Op-art movement. He incorporated other colours into his work in the 1970s. His work has been exhibited in London, Paris, New York, Milan, the Venice Biennale (1986), and elsewhere in Europe and the Americas. He has participated in more than 100 group exhibitions and had 17 one-man shows, the first at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1961. His works are in a number of public collections in the UK, including Tate Britain, the British Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum, the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Arts Council and the Department of the Environment, and in other countries. Steele's painting Gespenstische Gestalt (1961–62) was shown in the exhibition \"Dynamo, Un Siècle de Lumière et de Mouvement dans l'Art 1913/2013\" at the Grand Palais in Paris in 2013. After he had gained a reputation as a practising artist in the early 1960s Steele was accepted by the college authorities with which he had previously tussled and he began lecturing in fine art in Cardiff, Barry and Newport. He then lectured at Portsmouth Polytechnic from May 1968 until December 1989. He was a member of the Portsmouth Sinfonia experimental orchestra organised by Gavin Bryars and Brian Eno, playing trombone."

He obtained 110,032 preferential votes, becoming the fifth most voted APRA senator in the country. In parliament he was a proponent of decentralization. Torres Vallejo voiced opposition to Alan García's moves towards nationalization of the banking sector. Subsequently he was expelled from the party. Torres Vallejo was the first prominent APRA leader to voice public criticism against García's presidency. In 1996 and 2006 he contested the mayoral elections in Trujillo unsuccessfully. Torres Vallejo was awarded the Order of the Liberator General San Martín by the government of Argentina."

  "text" : "Johann Ulich, the younger (Wittenberg, 1677-Zerbst, 1742) was a German organist and composer in Zerbst, and music teacher to the princely family. Ulich was born in 1677 in Wittenberg where his father, also called Johann Ulich (1634-1712), was organist and Kantor, director of music for Wittenberg's churches, and teacher at the city school. Ulich Jr studied with his father and then from 1695 at the University of Wittenberg. He was employed at the court in Zerbst from 1708 (although his official contract  is dated 6 March 1709, the accounts of the St. Bartholomäikirche  show that he was paid at least one quarterly salary installment and some of the bonuses that all permanent staff there enjoyed annually in 1708). Almost immediately he started composing music for the court; on 24 June 1708, his cantata \"Glückselige Stunden! gesegnetes Licht\" for the birthday of Princess Sophia (wife of Prince Carl Wilhelm) was performed and, at least for some years, Ulich seems to have been considered the court composer. This changed in 1716 when Johann Baptist Kuch was appointed Capell Director. When Kuch suddenly vanished from Zerbst in 1722, Ulich temporarily seems to have taken charge of music again but this was short lived as the renowned Johann Friedrich Fasch was appointed court Kapellmeister that same year. Ulich was to work under the younger man as \"Organist und Cammer Musico\" (according to a petition by his widow for financial assistance to bring up the couple's five children) until his retirement."

Bessen was also a Fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Bessen researches the economics of innovation, including patents and economic history. He has written about software patents with Eric Maskin, arguing that they might inhibit innovation rather than stimulate progress. With Michael J. Meurer, he wrote Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk as well as papers on patent trolls. His book Learning by Doing: The Real Connection Between Innovation, Wages, and Wealth argues that major new technologies require new skills and knowledge that are slow and difficult to develop, affecting jobs and wages. Bessen developed the first WYSIWYG desktop publishing program at a community newspaper in Philadelphia in 1983. He established and ran a company, Bestinfo, to sell that program commercially. In 1993, Bestinfo was sold to Intergraph."

Born and educated in Scotland, he emigrated to Argentina in 1862, and on the outbreak of the Paraguayan War served as a pharmacist in the Argentine Army medical corps. He became an Argentine citizen in 1873. At the time Kyle was active specialisation was not an option in Latin American chemistry and it was necessary for a chemist to be a sort of polymath or jack-of-all-trades. Kyle was appointed professor of chemistry at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires in 1871, and chief chemist to the Casa de Moneda de la República Argentina (the Argentine Mint) in 1881. He was appointed professor of organic chemistry at the University of Buenos Aires (1889); Chemist to the Inspectorate-General of Sanitary Works (1890); professor of industrial chemistry at the Colegio Nacional (1892); and professor of inorganic chemistry at Buenos Aires University (1896). He was director of the first chemistry doctoral thesis in Argentina (1901). The Premio \"Dr. Juan J. J. Kyle\", awarded quinquennially by the Argentine Chemical Association for the best contribution to any branch of chemistry, and its most prestigious prize, is named in his honour."

  "text" : "Josefa Joaquina Sanchez (18 October 1765 - 1813) was a Venezuelan heroine who made the flag of the revolutionary movement, leading her to be considered the (Bordadora de la primera Bandera de Venezuela) \"embroiderer of the first flag of Venezuela\". Born in La Guaira, she was the daughter of Joaquin Sanchez and Juana Bastidas. On July 27, 1783, she married the Venezuelan military leader José María España with whom she had nine children. Together with her husband, she was involved in the Conspiración de Gual y España that was intended to raise the Venezuelan population to raise arms and free themselves from Spain. Sanchez was commissioned to copy the documents of the revolutionary movement and make the flags that would be used by the revolutionaries. On May 8, 1799, her husband was killed by the Venezuelan authorities who hung his corpse as a warning to other conspirators. Days before, Sanchez had been questioned by Venezuelan officials regarding Spain, after a black slave named Rafael Spain betray them. After the death of her husband, she was arrested and taken to Caracas, where months later, she received a prison sentence for a period of eight years, which she would serve in the Casa Hospicio de Caracas. However, in 1808, under the terms of her sentence, she was banished to Cumaná with her children. Once the process of independence of Venezuela started, she returned to Venezuela and applied for a pension to the government. She died in 1813 in Cumaná."

  "text" : "Juliana Sophia Schierberg, known as Julianchen (died 1712) was a Swedish favorite. She was the personal chamber maid and influential confidante of Princess Hedvig Sophia of Sweden and known for her influence and political activity. Juliana Schierberg was employed as a chamber maid to Queen Ulrika Eleonora in 1681, and was given the same position to the eldest Princess, Hedvig Sophia, upon the death of the queen in 1693. She had a similar position with Hedvig Sophia as Emerentia von Düben had with the younger Princess, Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden, and acted as the political adviser of the Princess. Various foreign diplomats contributed the fact that the marriage alliance between Denmark and Sweden, which was to take place with a marriage between Hedvig Sophia and Prince Charles of Denmark and Charles XII of Sweden and Princess Sophia Hedwig of Denmark, did not take place, was because of her influence, as was that the fact Hedvig Sophia did not marry William III of England but the Duke of Holstein in 1698. In 1702, she played the same important part in the marriage negotiations regarding the expected new marriage of Hedvig Sophia after her widowhood. Juliana Schierberg reportedly accepted bribes and had a net of spies to work for the benefit of the Princess, and influential people unsuccessfully tried to have her removed from court because of her influence. In 1708, a party consisting of Fritze, a favorite servant of Hedvig Sophia, and the two ladies-in-waiting Maria Horn and Charlotta von Liewen tried to have her removed from court by saying to the Princess that Schierberg had become senile, but as Schierberg as a chamber maid slept in the same room as the Princess and had access to her all the time this did not succeed. In 1708, Hedvig Sophia died of small pocks. Gossip accused Schierberg to have caused her death by exposing her to superstitious medical treatments and letting no one in to the sickbed of the Princess except Maria Horn, neither the överhovmästarinna Märta Berendes nor the doctor. Juliana Schierberg retired with a fortune after the death of Hedvig Sophia, which is proven by the fact that she was able to donate a great sum to finance the Great Nordic War in 1710."

  "text" : "Jim Burns is an English poet, writer and magazine editor. He was born in Preston, Lancashire in 1936. Burns was educated at grammar school, worked in mills, and joined the army in 1954. While stationed in Germany, Burns developed a love of jazz and of American writers, accessible through American Forces Network radio and through bookshops stocking new literature for American service personnel. After leaving the army in 1957, he returned to Preston and sought out new writers filtering through to Britain, travelling to Manchester and London to explore those experimental bookshops which stocked the more difficult-to-find ones. Burns had his first poems published in New Voice magazine in 1962, and soon began writing for and about small poetry magazines in a range of publications including The Guardian, Tribune and Ambit. Several books of his poetry have been published, including two volumes of his selected works. In 1964, Burns launched Move, a poetry magazine featuring British and North American writers (including Chris Torrance, Larry Eigner, Lee Harwood, Bill Deemer, Michael Horovitz, Earle Birney, Dave Cunliffe and Tina Morris) which ran for eight issues (it folded in 1968): it was part of the British poetry revival, lauded beyond the traditional audience of middle class intellectuals in London, Oxford and Cambridge. Burns contributed poetry to many other magazines, and literary reviews and articles to The Guardian, Tribune and New Society. Perhaps his most important contributions were bringing the world of small poetry magazines to a wider audience through regular reviews and columns, and in particular spreading his knowledge of those lesser known North American writers who he felt deserved greater attention. When the editor of Palantir poetry magazine (published through Preston Polytechnic) stepped down, Burns took over from issue number 3 in May 1976; this gave him the opportunity to direct attention to writers he felt deserved more support. Working on Palantir through to the final (23rd) issue in 1983, he included work from many leading poets (for example, Gael Turnbull, Wes Magee and Edwin Brock), and wrote about the lesser known beat poets. As of 2014, Burns continues to write on jazz, literature and politics, and has published several essay collections including Beats, Bohemians & Intellectuals (Trent Books, 2000), Radicals, Beats & Beboppers (Penniless Press, 2011) and Artists, Beats & Cool Cats (Penniless Press, 2014)."

  "text" : "Johann Friedrich Naue (November 17, 1787 in Halle (Saale) – May 19, 1858 in Halle) was a German composer, organist, and choir director and music-theorist. He was a student of Ludwig van Beethoven and Daniel Gottlob Turk and Carl Friedrich Zelter. He composed both secular and spiritual music, and is known for reforming Protestant liturgical music in romantic-era Germany. Naue studied music in Berlin. Along with Felix Mendelssohn, Naue took lessons from Carl Friedrich Zelter. Zelter exposed him to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frederic Handel. In 1808, he returned to Halle to study with Daniel Gottlob Türk. In 1815 Naue became a member of the Halle Masonic Lodge \"of the three swords\" along with Türk and Carl Loewe. Naue went to Vienna to study briefly with Ludwig van Beethoven. On November 23, 1823 Beethoven dedicated his three-part canon \"Kurz ist der Schmerz\", WoO 163, to Naue. The text \"Kurz is der Schmerz und ewig ist die Freude\" (\"Brief is the pain and forever is the joy\"), is from The Maid of Orleans by Friedrich von Schiller, the same poet who wrote the text for Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy.\" In 1829, Naue sold all of his books and spent all of his inheritance in order to finance a music festival in Halle. The festival was an economic failure that drove Naue to alcoholism. In 1833 he was fired as head of the singing academy he created. In 1835 he was fired as organist of the \"Market Church of Our Lady.\" He eventually went blind and died in poverty in 1858. While Naue was a well-regarded composer and theorist in his own time, his music is now rarely played.Nevertheless, Naue was a prolific composer of piano, organ, choral, and orchestral music. He often composed commissioned occasional or festive music, such as military and triumphal marches for the Prussian army."

  "text" : "Joshua Gagnon (born November 14, 1979) is the founding pastor of Next Level Church, a church with multiple locations throughout New England. NLC has grown from a team of 12 people to a megachurch, with multiple locations across the New England region, since its launch on Easter of 2008. Next Level Church has been featured on CNN, and has become known for its unique outreaches, community involvement, and relevant, tangible teaching. In 2009 they hosted their first annual Egg Drop which drew over 12,000 people in attendance, and the event has become an annual tradition, with tens of thousands of plastic eggs dropped from helicopters. Gagnon is considered one of the most influential leaders and visionaries in New England and now coaches and works with dozens of other pastors and church leaders, as well as being a highly regarded speaker for leadership and church growth. He is the founder of the Activate Conference, a conference and coaching network where church leaders throughout New England are inspired, encouraged, and taught how to reach people with the gospel of Jesus Christ."

John worked as a general store and ferry operator across the Willamette River to Linnton. He once served as Justice of the Peace and was twice an election judge. John was born in Ohio and first settled in Indiana with his wife and child where John worked as an educator. He joined the Bartleson–Bidwell Party in 1841, who were one of the first groups that trekked the California Trail. By this time, John's wife and child had died. He came to Oregon Country in the employment of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843 after making it to Sacramento Valley. Following John's death in 1886, his estate was executed by Philip T. Smith who met court injunctions from John's sister and niece. Smith was replaced as executor by Robert Catilin who battled John's relatives until 1907 when the estate was finally settled. In John's will and testament he gave a large portion of his property towards the erection of a new public school for St. Johns and designated his personal effects liquidated and the funds be used for building materials. His only condition for the school was that it not be related to any religious \"sect\". In 1907, Catilin ordered the City of St. Johns to forfeit the land given to them by John, but gave them a small portion of the land to erect a school on. James John High School opened in 1911 and closed in 1921."

He served in that position until March 2014. He is on the advisory board of Rutgers University's Voorhees Transportation Center and the Board of Trustees for the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority. Weinstein holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy from Seton Hall University. Weinstein had previously served as New Jersey Commissioner of Transportation and Chairman of the NJ Transit Board of Directors from 1998 to 2002. Weinstein has been senior vice president of AECOM, a global transportation consulting and engineering firm, since 2002. Prior to joining the firm, he was senior vice president of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. Weinstein formerly served as a Vice Chairman and member of the Board of Directors of the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. He has also served on the boards of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Delaware River Port Authority and New Jersey's toll agencies. Weinstein's tenure at NJ Transit has been called \"rocky' by The New York Times; it was characterized by major fare increases, the damage of equipment due to insufficient precautions in face of Hurricane Sandy, and overcrowding during what had been marketed as the Mass Transit Super Bowl. In February 2014 he announced his resignation, effective March 2; his successor is Veronique Hakim. Numerous other staff have also left the agency since Weinstein's resignation. A lifelong resident of New Jersey, he resides in Moorestown with his wife."

  "text" : "Jacqueline Barbara Vaughn (née Robinson; July 27, 1935 – January 22, 1994) was an American Chicago Public Schools special education teacher and labor leader. She was the first African-American and first woman to head the nation's third largest teachers union local. She served as President of the Chicago Teachers Union from 1984 to 1994, the Illinois Federation of Teachers (1989–94), and Vice-President of the American Federation of Teachers (1974–1994). She led what has been called one of the \"mightiest teachers unions in the nation.\" Vaughn was famous for her fashion sense and her no-nonsense negotiation style in contract talks. Her ability to build consensus between the leadership team, the teachers and school support staff garnered respect from those in and out to the educational system. Vaughn spent much of her career trying to reform the educational system. Through her vision, the CTU Quest Center was created to give school professionals a place to design more effective teaching methods and student learning techniques. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley called Jacqueline Vaughn \"a courageous and tireless champion for men and women working in our most noble profession, teaching.\""

  "text" : "Jost Fitschen (1 January 1869, Brest (Lower Saxony) – 26 January 1947, Hamburg-Altona) was a German botanist known for his work in the field of dendrology. Beginning in 1889, he worked as a schoolteacher in the town of Geversdorf, afterwards teaching classes in Magdeburg (1894–1901), where he worked closely with Otto Schmeil. With Schmeil, he was co-author of the popular \"Flora von Deutschland\", a book on German flora that was published over many editions (90th edition issued in 1996). From 1901 to 1930, he taught classes in Altona, where for a period of time he also served as an academic rector. In his later years, he suffered from a nervous disorder that placed severe limitations on his activities."

  "text" : "Josephine (Josie) Bond Hebron (November 22, 1894 - February 1982) was an avid traveler, business woman, author/publisher and an African-American pioneer. She was the cousin of the African-American composer and pianist Carl Rossini Diton and sister of the African-American composer and pianist John Harvey Hebron, Marian Anderson’s accompanist and piano teacher. After starting a funeral home in Philadelphia with her husband, Paul Farwell Keene Sr., Hebron co-founded the National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women’s Clubs, Incorporated (NANBPWC, Inc.). In July 1935, Ollie Chinn Porter, President of the New York Club, extended an invitation to local clubs, organized as Business and Professional Women’s Clubs, to join and form a national organization. The Founders were Emma Odessa Young, Ollie Chinn Porter and Effie Diton of New York City; Bertha Perry Rhodes, Josephine B. Keene and Adelaide Flemming of Philadelphia; and Pearl Flippen of Atlantic City. In 1939, Josephine authored and published the Directory of Negro business and professional women of Philadelphia and vicinity. Josephine loved to travel visiting among many places, the West Indies as well as Europe. Josephine and Paul had two boys and two girls, including renowned artist Paul F. Keene Jr."

Mallari is known for a visual style similar to the contemporary Filipino figurative expressionism common among members of the Grupong Salimpusa and Sanggawa art movements, but distinguished by a narrative approach which one critic has described as exploring \"the linkages between literature and art\" - an approach which she attributes to her exposure to the pre-digital animation industry during her developmental years as an artist. She is also known for exploring themes of identity and marginalization in Philippine society. The children's book \"Doll Eyes\", which she co-created with writer Eline Santos, won the National Children's Book Award in 2011."

In 1957 he was the Launch and Flight Weather Officer for the first U.S, intercontinental missile (Snark). In 1958, as the Launch Weather Officer for Explorer 1, the first U.S. satellite, he delayed America's entry into the space race for two days with his correct forecasts of extreme upper air wind shear. On the third day, January 31, his forecast was for the jet stream to move far enough away from Cape Canaveral for the upper air winds to allow an evening launch. Dr. Kurt Debus, the launch director, accepted this forecast and ordered the missile to be fueled. At about 10:48 pm, Explorer 1 was successfully launched. From 1964 to 1970 he was a member of the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Longrifle Team that competed against teams from other states. Because of his participation in this competition he was commissioned an Honorary Kentucky Colonel in 1967 by Governor Edward Breathitt. In 1969 he won the Indiana Open Flintlock Championship competing against marksmen from six states. In 1992 he saved lives by discovering radioactive depleted uranium was used in the manufacture of frizzens used in muzzle-loading flintlock rifles. He plays a recurring role of Pappy 5X in the book and webisode series the Zombie Cause."

She did her postdoctoral research with George Whitesides at Harvard University, investigating micro/nanofabrication and near-field optics. In 1998, she joined Bell Labs as a member of the technical staff where she has made a number of pioneering contributions, including developing new biomimetic approaches for the synthesis of ordered mineral films with highly controlled shapes and orientations, and discovering unique biological optical systems that outperform technological analogs, as well as characterizing the associated organic molecules. In 2007, Aizenberg joined the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The lab's research investigates a wide range of topics that include biomimetics, self-assembly, adaptive materials, crystal engineering, surface wettability, nanofabrication, biooptics, biomaterials, and biomechanics."

He was also active in his community as a member of his church, a trustee of many local organizations, and as a member of local historical societies. Loud invented and obtained a patent for what is considered to be the first ballpoint pen in 1888; however his invention was not commercialized and the patent would eventually lapse. The modern ballpoint pen would be patented later in 1938 by László Bíró, 22 years following Loud's death."

Her career as an activist was ended in 1933, when the Nazi Party rose to power. There is no public record of a funeral but witnesses report that Elberskirchen's urn was secretly put into Hildegard Moniac's grave, who had been her life partner."

In his acclaimed book Visions, he writes about his personal life in both Amsterdam and New York. Describing political issues, disappointing love affairs and drug abuse, in a witty voice, With Visions Koning reached a widespread audience. Koning returned to writing with two Dutch novels, Noppen and Anoniem, which are written from a fictional character's point of view, but seem to deal with personal grief at the same time."

  "text" : "John Lynch (c1832 - 1866) was an Irish nationalist. He was a resident of the city of Cork and an alleged member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. John was very active in the early days of the Cork fenian movement. He organised nationalist celebrations on St. Patrick's night 1862 at the Athenaeum club, Cork. Lynch worked as an accountant. The marriage of the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and Alexandra of Denmark on 10 March 1863 was an occasion for loyalist celebrations in Cork. Houses and shops had their windows illuminated. This increased nationalistic unrest, with windows being smashed and the mayor being roughly handled.  Several rioters were prosecuted, including Lynch and James Mountaine. Both were acquitted due to lack of evidence. He was again arrested in Sept 1865, as part of the general purge of Fenian leaders, based on information provided by John Warner, an ex-military pensioner. The trial of John Lynch and co-defendant Brian Dillon starting on 18 December 1865 with Isaac Butt as their legal counsel. The charges were \"in one indictment with having conspired to depose the Queen, &c., and with illegally drilling and being drilled in furtherance of that design\". Lynch was accused of being a captain (denoted as \"B\") in the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Both were found guilty, based primarily on the testimony of informants  although John Warner's account was very weak and unsatisfactory under cross examination. At this time, John Lynch was seriously ill from tuberculosis. At his sentencing, John disputed the testimony of John Warner, saying he had never learned to use a rifle and said \"If, having served my country honestly and sincerely be treason, I am not ashamed of it. I am now prepared to receive any punishment British law can inflict on me.\"  Both defendants were sentenced to 10 years' penal servitude. In January 1866, he was transferred from Mountjoy Prison, Dublin to Pentonville Prison, London  where the conditions were very harsh. Because of his condition, he was transferred to Woking Prison hospital, Surrey, where he died on 2 June 1866. He is commemorated on the National Memorial in the city of Cork  and at Brookwood Cemetery, UK where he is buried."

  "text" : "Jacques Denys (Denis) Choisy (5 April 1799, Jussy – 26 November 1859, Geneva) was a Swiss Protestant clergyman and botanist. He studied theology, law, humanities and sciences at the Académie de Genéve. In 1821 he became ordained as a minister, and during the following year, furthered his education in Paris. During his stay in Paris, he was accepted as a member of the Société d'histoire naturelle. Following his return to Geneva in 1824, he was named chair of rational philosophy at the Academy, a position he maintained until 1847. As a student in Geneva, he came under the influence of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, and in the process, developed a lifelong passion for botany. He was a principal contributor towards Candolle's publication of \"Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis\", being the author of the sections involving the plant families Marcgraviaceae, Convolvulaceae, Hydroleaceae, Selaginaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Hypericineae and Guttiferae. The botanical genus Choisya (family Rutaceae) is named in his honor. As a theologian/philosopher he published works with titles such as, \"Des doctrines exclusives en philosophie rationelle\" (1828) and \"Les lois morales: Fragment d'un cours de philosophie morale\" (1836)."

  "text" : "Akhmad Bassah (also Bassakh; [axˈmad baˈsax]; fl. 1923–30), best known by the pen name Joehana ([juˈhana]; Perfected Spelling: Yuhana), was an author of the Dutch East Indies who wrote in Sundanese. He worked for a time on the railroad before becoming an author by 1923, and had a strong interest in social welfare; this interest influenced his novels. He was also a productive translator, dramatist, and reporter, and operated a company which offered writing services. Sources disagree when Joehana died; some offer 1930, while others give 1942–45. During the seven years in which he was active, Joehana wrote a number of stories and articles, as well as several novels. The years of publication are generally unclear, as reprints included neither the year of first publication nor the printing number. Stylistically, Joehana has been classified as a realist owing to his use of the names of actual locations and products in his works, as well as the predominantly vernacular Sundanese in his novels. However, influences from traditional theatrical forms such as wayang and literature such as pantun are evident. Joehana's works cover a wide range of themes, although in general they are oriented towards social criticism and promote modernization. Though Joehana's works were published independently, they were popular in the Bandung area where they were sold. Local businesses may have offered funds for product placement, and Joehana's works were adapted to the stage and film. However, they received little academic attention until the 1960s, and critical consensus since then has been negative. Two of his works have been republished since the 1960s, and stage productions of his novel Rasiah nu Goreng Patut continued into the 1980s."

  "text" : "Jonas Jonsson (1806 – 7 November 1885) was a Swedish master builder from Eksjö, Sweden, who built many churches, important town buildings in Stockholm, and lighthouses along the Swedish coast. Jonsson was born in a smallholding outside Eksjö in 1806. Little is known of his early years or education. Lars Strömbäck assumes in his short biography that the boy was apprenticed to a local builder. Records from 1826 mention Jonsson as \"verkmästare\", foreman, at the building of the empire style church in Lofta, designed by the prominent architect Per Axel Nyström. Johnson was to collaborate for many years with Nyström, and had by 1836 progressed to being in full charge of the building of Nyström's church in Utna. Jonsson was prodigiously productive throughout his career. This took place at a time when the Empire style was popular throughout Europe; particular so in Sweden where it had been introduced by King Karl Johan of Sweden and Norway, the former Marshal of France General Bernadotte, where it was named after the king as the Karl Johan style. The style remained popular in Scandinavia throughout the nineteenth century. This fashion was sustained by France paying some of its debts to Sweden in ormolu bronzes rather than money. The buildings Jonas Jonsson supervised were often designed by prominent architects such as Nyström, Jöran Folke Oppman and Folke Birger Oppman, and were financed by parishes, the Swedish state, or rural nobility and gentry. His influence on building practices in Tjust was such that the characteristic Tjust empire style was sometimes referred to as the \"Jonsson empire style\". He also gradually acquired some architectural skills, and is himself the architect of several buildings such as Linköping Savings Bank and Vimmerby City Hotel. The rapid growth of shipping in the mid-19th century led to a need for more lighthouses along the Swedish coasts, and Jonsson was responsible for many new or refurbished lighthouses during the 1840s: Vinga, Hållö, Kullen, Morups Tånge, Långe Erik, Fårö, Landsort and more. He was so successful as a lighthouse-builder that he was eventually offered such jobs without the standard tender procedure for government-financed buildings. However, there are also records of complaints from both workers and government inspectors, giving a picture of an unyielding man. Jonsson married Fanny Sundström in 1842 and they had four children. Strömbäck describes Jonsson as an example of social mobility: from humble rural beginnings, he became a wealthy citizen of the thriving city of Linköping, owner of several houses and member of the city council."

Lagana was raised in Ridgefield where he served on the borough's planning board. He attended Fordham University where he received a B.A. in history in 2000 and later attended the Thomas M. Cooley Law School where he received his J.D. in 2004. He has served as a clerk to Superior Court Judge John A. Conte before joining Chasan Leyner & Lamparello, a law firm in Secaucus as a partner. In April 2009, he moved to Paramus. Lagana and his Democratic running mate defeated two incumbent Republican councilmembers in the Paramus borough council elections of 2011. Lagana served as a Councilman for Paramus, New Jersey. After Democrats gained a majority of the six-person borough council after the 2012 elections, Lagana was named council president in January 2013. Lagana declared his candidacy for the 38th district in the November 2013 elections, to succeed Connie Wagner, who was not running for reelection. When Wagner resigned in September, Lagana indicated that he was not interested in filling the remainder of her term; 38th District Democrats chose former Assemblyman and State Senator Paul Contillo to fill the remainder of her term. Lagana won the election and was sworn in on January 14, 2014 at the start of the 2014 session. In the Assembly, he serves on the Appropriations Committee, the Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee, and the Judiciary Committee. He is married to Jamie Lagana and has two daughters."

He was a student at Rock Hill College in Baltimore, Maryland, and also took a business course at Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York. When he was 19 years old, Mr. Kaul started work at his father's lumber company, and in 1888 put in charge of the operation of the hardwood mill of the company. In 1889 he moved to the south to locate a yellow pine tract for operation, and he settled in Hollins, Alabama in 1890. He later moved to Birmingham, where he served as the president of Kaul Lumber Company. Kaul served as president of the Southern Pine Association and was a pioneer in the activities to assure conservation of the national timber supply. He worked with Gifford Pinchot, then United States Forester, to greatly reduce practices that wasted wood. He also belonged to the National Lumberman's Committee on Forestry and was chairman of the Southern Pine Forestry Committee. Kaul was a consistent Democrat, but he did not seek public office that would have distracted from his lumber manufacturing and sales interests. He served in a national capacity as a member of the American Commission to study rural credits in Europe; as a member of the State Board of Forestry, and as chairman of the Park Commission of the City of Birmingham. During World War I, Kaul served as a member of the Southern Pine War Service Committee of the War Industries Board, and was also chairman of the Birmingham and Jefferson County Victory Loan Committees. Kaul was a member of the Concatenated Order of Hoo-Hoo."

  "text" : "Johnny Broderick (January 16, 1896 (some sources say 1894, 1895, or 1897) – January 16, 1966) was a New York City Police Department detective who became known in the 1920s and 1930s as one of the city's toughest officers, patrolling the Broadway theater district and policing strikes as head of the NYPD's Industrial Squad, sometimes personally beating gangsters and suspects. In his career as a detective between 1923 and 1947, Broderick built a reputation for physical courage, for assaulting gangsters like Jack \"Legs\" Diamond and \"Two-Gun\" Crowley, and for facing down armed gunmen in a prison break at The Tombs prison. Broderick was a \"celebrity detective\" whose exploits were a favorite of gossip columnists and the press. He and his sometime partner Johnny Cordes were probably the best known officers in the NYPD in the era between the two world wars. A character based on Broderick was the subject of the 1936 film Bullets or Ballots, with the Broderick character played by Edward G. Robinson. He was also portrayed in a comic book about police, and a film, TV series and Broadway musical based on his life were once contemplated. Broderick won eight medals for valor during his career, but hewas dogged by accusations of excessive force. The Industrial Squad under his command was accused of brutality toward strikers and corruption, with Broderick himself accused of taking bribes, and he once beat a prisoner in his custody so badly that he was permanently crippled. He would sometimes beat up innocent people, and brutality complaints against him were futile. He was finally forced into retirement by Mayor William O'Dwyer for associating with gangsters."

  "text" : "John Macqueen (27 June 1895 - 21 June 1969) was a doctor and medical administrator working in Palestine during the British Mandate. Born in the Black Isle, Scotland, he was educated in Inverness continuing his studies at Edinburgh University where, in 1914, he received a degree in Medicine and Surgery. In September 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, he joined the Royal Field Artillery serving as a 2nd Lieutenant in France and Flanders. He then became a Captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps and saw action with the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force where he was mentioned twice in despatches. In September 1919 he joined the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration (OETA) in Palestine and nine months later he was appointed Assistant Principal Medical Officer, based in Jerusalem. During the late 1920s, as deputy head of the Palestinian Department of Health, Dr Macqueen was involved in the establishment of the first infant welfare centres in Jerusalem's Old City and Bethlehem. It was part of a government program to reduce infant mortality which at that time was 201.27 per 1,000 births. By 1929 there were 27 such centers across the country, mostly funded by non-government bodies. Macqueen complained about the absence of financial support from municipalities, specifically Bethlehem and Bayt Jala. At that time the Health department, with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, was active in combating malaria. Trachoma affected more than 60% of the population, with many sufferers being treated by the St Johns Eye Hospital, Jerusalem. Leprosy was disappearing, and there were vaccines for the other infectious diseases found in Palestine: rabies, cholera and smallpox. In 1924 he was appointed Senior Medical Officer in Hafia. In 1930 he was given particular responsibility for the railways and the quarantine of travellers. It was during this period that he completed his medical training. He was awarded a M.D. in 1931, and a D.P.H. in 1933, both at Edinburgh.In 1931 Macqueen was appointed Senior Medical Officer in Haifa and Samaria District and in 1938 he became director of the new Government Haifa Hospital, designed by Erich Mendelsohn. It had 261 beds and included a nursing school. In the summer of 1941 during an outbreak of Bubonic plague he was in charge of the demolition of the several thousand huts and temporary homes in and around Haifa and introduced a program of rat extermination. This campaign was successful but in 1944 the disease re-appeared killing eleven people in Haifa and spreading up and down Palestine. The Department of Health was severely under funded. In 1936 he attempted to introduce a health insurance scheme to pay for medical care in Arab villages. This project was halted with the outbreak of the 1936-1939 revolt. In 1938 and again in 1945 he put forward similar proposals for funding health care, modelled on the insurance systems used in England. In a report he pointed out that in Jenin with a population of 50,000 there were four doctors whereas amongst a similar population in Great Britain you would expect to find 25. Another area of concern was the lack of care for mental patients. There was only an asylum in Bethlehem and a section of Acre prison being maintained by the state; a total of around 160 beds. In 1942 there was a critical fall in conditions in privately run mental hospitals in Tel Aviv when the municipality stopped funding them. At the time the High Commissioner, Sir Harold MacMichael, commented that the treatment of the insane in Palestine \"reflected badly on the Government\".The 1946 \"Survey of Palestine\", prepared for the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, commented that Government expenditure on health care was low compared to other countries and that medical policy had not been carried out. Provision for control of tuberculosis was \"still lacking\", accommodation for those with mental diseases was \"still inadequate\". There was a shortage of trained midwives and the number of infant welfare centers had only risen to 38. Infant mortality amongst the Muslim population was 251 per 1,000 births. Venereal disease had become endemic. John MacQueen retired in 1946."

He is Director of the Violence Prevention Research Unit (VPRU) in the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine and a participent in the WHO Violence Prevention Alliance. He has made two extended appearances on the TV discussion programme After Dark. In the first, chaired by Matthew Parris in 1991, he joined among others Michael Winner and the father of The Yorkshire Ripper. The second, in 2003, chaired by Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, aroused a measure of controversy. VPRU research focuses on the epidemiology of violence in the general population, prediction of violence and risk assessment for offenders. The VPRU have made a major breakthrough in identifying the causal link between delusions and violence. A survey of Young Men's Health led to the identification of the previously undescribed heavy burden on NHS Mental Health Services posed by gang members in the UK. No stranger to controversy, Professor Coid has recently described the difficulties of using standardised tools to predict violence amongst psychopaths, with statistical findings proving that they are no more reliable than chance and has reopened debate on this subject and received a lot of media attention."

The Orland Fire Protection District covers Orland Township, the Village of Orland Park, the Village of Orland Hills, unincorporated areas of Orland Township, and parts of Tinley Park. Hickey was first elected to serve a six year term on the OFPD in 2009 as a trustee, and was elected as the board's president in 2010. As the new president of the board, Hickey and the board cut the District's budget by more than $2 million during the first year Born in Chicago, Illinois, he attended St Adrian Grammar School, St. Laurence High School, DePaul University (BA Liberal Arts), and graduated from Benedictine University with an MBA and concentrations in Finance & Accounting. He’s the director of business development (real estate) for Peace Village, a senior citizens community in Palos Park, but before that was a partner in a mortgage and real estate business. Hickey grew up on the Southwest Side of Chicago in St. Adrian Parish near 71st Street and Western Avenue “where my parents and grandparents had lived.” Hickey has also run several times for public elective office including in the Democratic Primary election for the new 11th Congressional District in 2012, which was won by Democrat and incumbent Congressman Bill Foster. The 11th District includes the municipalities of Joliet, Aurora, Naperville, Burr Ridge, Woodridge, Darien, Bolingbrook and Plainfield, but does not include Orland Park or the OFPD. During his election, he proposed eliminating the interest paid by students on government loans to college students as a means of assisting college students. In December 2013, he announced his intention to run for the United States Congress in the 2nd Congressional District, the seat formerly held by former Congressman Jesse Jackson, but later withdrew. Hickey also was a surprise candidate for a seat on the Cook county Board in the 17th District to challenge three-term incumbent Cook County Commissioner Elizabeth Doody Gorman. But Hickey, a Democrat, and Gorman, a Republican commissioner and GOP Committeeman of Orland Township, are political allies. Hickey was unchallenged in the March 18, 2014 Democratic Primary and is the Democratic nominee for the November 4, 2014 general election. Hickey said he entered the race for the 17th District Cook County Board believing that Gorman, his ally who was a key supporter in Hickey's election, was planning to run for higher office and that he would only seek Gorman's seat in the November 4, 2014 Illinois general election if she retired. Hickey is the past president of Toastmasters International (2005–2006). He is divorced and has four children."

  "text" : "James H. Karales (July 15, 1930, Canton, Ohio - April 1, 2002, Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.) was a photographer and photo-essayist best known for his work with Look magazine from 1960 to 1971. At Look he covered the Civil Rights Movement throughout its duration, taking many of the movements memorable photographs, including those of the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his family. Karales' best known single-image is the iconic photograph of the Selma to Montgomery march showing people proudly marching along the highway under a cloudy turbulent sky. Karales also covered and photographed the war in Vietnam for Look, and earlier had worked for two years with photo-essay photographer W. Eugene Smith. He produced his own photo essays, including works showing what life was like for the working citizens of Rendville, Ohio and, before he met Smith, a photo-essay on the Greek-American community in his hometown of Canton, Ohio. In 2013, a book of Karales' photographs, CONTROVERSY AND HOPE: The Civil Rights Movement Photographs of James Karales, was published by the University of South Carolina Press."

  "text" : "Jane Bruce (1847 or 1848 – 30 November 1907) was a Canadian teacher. Born in Nova Scotia's Musquodoboit Valley, Bruce spent some time in the United States, likely teaching in Boston for a period. In her 30s, she returned to Nova Scotia where she attended the Normal School in Truro, earning a diploma and, in 1883, a first-class license. That same year, she started teaching at Lockman Street School in Halifax, a segregated school for black girls. The next year, the school was merged with the Maynard Street School, creating a coeducational, but still segregated, school, and Bruce was appointed principal. In 1884 the city's black residents had, after years of protests and campaigning, gained the right to attend integrated primary schools rather than one of the two segregated schools (the other school was in Africville). As the white principal of a segregated school, Bruce was viewed with suspicion by the black community. She was charged with assaulting a pupil in 1886 (she won the case), and was investigated by the school board after letters she wrote to the board, in which she referred to her students as \"darkeys\", were made public. The investigation exonerated Bruce, but she resigned her position in 1892. When she reapplied in 1893, the board, despite its earlier decision, declined to hire her. The school supervisor, in protest, offered her a substitute teaching position at the Albro Street School. She remained there until 1901, then transferred to the Acadian School on Argyle Street, once again a principal. Bruce remained principal of the Acadian School until her death in 1907."

His novels include Under Cover of Daylight, Hard Aground, Gone Wild, Buzz Cut, Red Sky at Night, Rough Draft, Off the Chart and Silencer. His writing includes the collection of personal essays Hot Damn, written for the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel's Sunshine Magazine, Washington Post and Miami Herald. His book Hit Lit is about common features of the twelve most commercially successful novels of the last hundred years. His two short story collections are Paper Products and Over Exposure. Over Exposure includes the short story \"The Carch\", winner of an Edgar Award. He also won a John D. MacDonald Award for Excellence in Florida Fiction, presented by the JDM Bibliophile. Hall was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky in 1947. He has a master's degree in creative writing from Johns Hopkins University and a doctorate in literature from the University of Utah. He was a Fulbright professor of literature in Spain. Hall began his career as a poet. He taught at Florida International University in Miami for 40 years and founded the school's creative writing program in the early 1970s. His wife's name is Evelyn and they have three dogs. They live in South Florida and western North Carolina (in the mountains). Several of Hall's novels center on a loner named Thorn who ties bonefish flies and partners with his private-eye friend Sugarman. They thwart a range of villains. Hall's fiction often uses Florida settings as a backdrop, including setting such as the Everglades and Key West. Hall's writing explores the contrast in South Florida between squalor and poverty coexisting with tremendous wealth and glamor."

  "text" : "Joel Adams, known as Jo Jo Adams (c.1918 – February 27, 1988), and sometimes credited as Doctor Jo-Jo Adams, was an American jump blues singer, comedian, dancer, and MC, who recorded in the 1940s and 1950s. He was born in a rural area of Alabama, and sang with the Big Four Gospel Jubilee Singers before moving to Chicago in the early 1940s. He then began performing in clubs on the South Side of Chicago, adopting a style derivative of Cab Calloway, wearing a tuxedo with extended tails that would swing around while he danced. He said: \"I introduced color to the stage. My tailor-made tails that were 55 inches long - when I spun around you could shoot dice on them!\" In 1946 he made his first recording, \"Jo Jo Blues\", with bandleader Freddie Williams for the Melody Lane record label, soon to be renamed Hy-Tone. He also recorded for Hy-Tone with guitarist Floyd Smith, including the marijuana-related song \"When I'm In My Tea\"; and recorded for the Aladdin label in Los Angeles with Maxwell Davis' band. After returning to Chicago, he recorded under Tom Archia's supervision for the Aristocrat label run by Leonard Chess. His recordings there included \"Cabbage Head\", a version of the folk song \"Our Gudeman\", also known as \"Seven Drunken Nights\". Adams appeared in the 1949 all-African American revue film Burlesque in Harlem, performing a risqué version of \"The Hucklebuck\". The following year, he began appearing regularly with Memphis Slim and Terry Timmons in clubs in Chicago, and at the end of the year performed at a New Year's Eve show with Lester Young and others. He also performed in his own revue, the \"Jo Jo Show\", which at various times featured singers Joe Williams, Willie Mabon, Bill Pinkard, and the Melvin Moore Combo. He made his last recordings in 1952 and 1953, for the Chance and Parrot labels; some of the latter recordings were arranged by Sun Ra. He continued to appear with his revue in Chicago nightclubs through most of the 1950s. His last credited performance was in 1958. After that, he gave up the music business except for occasionally playing in his local neighborhood. He died in Chicago in 1988, aged about 70. His early recordings were anthologised on CD by the French label, Chronological Classics, in 2004."

While at MIT, he founded the student UAV team, known as Project: A²RES. After college, Downey worked at Boeing on the development of the A160T Hummingbird, an autonomous helicopter developed for DARPA and SOCOM that went on to set the world record for flight endurance in its weight class (at 18.7 hours) and achieved one of the highest hover out of ground effects (20,000 feet). In 2011, Downey founded Airware to serve the market gap between military-grade autopilots and hobbyist projects. Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures announced a $10.7 million investment in Airware in May 2013. Kleiner Perkins led an additional $25 million investment in Airware in July 2014. Downey was a member of the winter 2013 Y Combinator batch. Downey’s father was a commercial pilot for 30 years, and Downey has a commercial multi-engine pilot’s license. His parents met when his father was his mother's flight instructor. Downey has said that Airware allows him to combine his two passions, engineering and aviation."

  "text" : "John Jones, (1854–1913) known as Coch Bach y Bala was a notorious Welsh criminal. His nickname, Coch Bach y Bala, literally translates as 'Little Redhead of Bala'. He is also known as the Welsh Houdini for having escaped on more than one occasion from Ruthin Gaol. A habitual criminal, Jones spent over half his life in prison from which he made repeated attempts (some successful) to escape. His first successful escape was in 1879 when he escaped from Ruthin Gaol while on remand for stealing some watches. By some method he opened the door of his cell and walked out of the front door of the gaol while the staff were having their evening meal. he was recaptured three month later near Colwyn Bay. In 1900 he attempted to escape from Caernarfon Gaol while awaiting transfer to Dartmoor prison. Barricading himself in his cell he began to tunnel out but was unsuccessful. Following two lengthy sentences in Dartmoor for burglary, Jones returned to North Wales and within months on his release was convicted of yet another burglary. Held in Ruthin Gaol while awaiting transfer, this time to Stafford Gaol, he tunnelled through the cell wall and climbed over the prison walls using a rope made from bedclothes. Six days later while being tracked on land near Llanelidan he was shot in the leg by Reginald Jones-Bateman and bled to death from the wound. He was buried in the graveyard of St Elidan's Church in Llanelidan, Denbighshire. Because of his exploits in escaping he was held in some regard by the local population and his funeral was well attended. His escapades were well reported in the press; describing his last escape the local paper wrote: SENSATIONAL ESCAPE FROM RUTHIN PRISONJohn Jones … effected his escape from Ruthin Prison on Tuesday morning, in a sensational manner, and at the time of writing is still at large. He gained his liberty as the result of indomitable pluck, great astuteness, and wonderful agility … ‘Coch Bach’ is regarded by some as a hero; his performance is certainly a daring piece of work. The escape took place between four and five o’clock in the morning, before the majority of the warders entered upon their duties… The daring manner of his escape, and the quickness with which he left behind him the precincts of the prison baffled the gaol authorities and the police.— North Wales Times, 4 October 1913"

  "text" : "John Bernard Philip Humbert de Salis, 9th Count de Salis-Soglio, TD, John da Buri, Graf v. Salis-Soglio, (London, 16 November 1947-Cà Buri, Mezzane di Sotto, Veneto, Italy 14 March 2014); SRI Comes, Illustris et Magnificus; former ICRC delegate and envoy; Knight Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion (2000) of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (knight, 1974), and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Order of Malta with Swords, first ambassador of the Order to Thailand 1986-98, Cambodia 1993-98, president of its Swiss Association (1995-2000) and of CIOMAL (Comité International de l'Ordre de Malte), 2000–08; British soldier and lawyer; Valpolicella vigneron. A Count of the Holy Roman Empire (Reichsgraf), (created by letters patent dated Vienna, 12 March 1748 for Envoy Peter de Salis-Soglio (1675-1749), of Chur and Chiavenna, and his son Jerome (Naturalized British in 1731), by Emperor Francis I), John de Salis was the only child of Lt. Colonel John Eugène, 8th Count de Salis (1891-1949), Irish Guards, by his Roman wife Maria Camilla (1926-1953) daughter of General Umberto Presti di Camarda by Teresa (d.1993), daughter of Filippo Nereo Vignola, of Mezzane and Verona. The grandson of the British Diplomat, Irish landowner and Catholic re-convert Sir John Francis Charles, 7th Count de Salis-Soglio, his earliest years were spent at 10 Priory Walk, Kensington, and 26 Roedean Crescent, Roehampton Gate, SW15. His father died when he was under two and his mother when he was five, his step-father when he was 10 and one of his two paternal uncles when he was four. His paternal grandparents had also died, in 1902 and 1939, so he was subsequently brought-up, inter-alia, by Franco-Belgian cousins in France (the widow and family of the 3rd Duc de Magenta at Sully in particular), his remaining paternal uncle in Wiltshire, and his Veronese maternal grandmother, Teresa Vignola Presti. He was educated at Downside, read law at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (LLB (1972) and LLM), and was called to the Bar, Grays Inn (1970). Later he was a tenant and then door-tenant, at 1 Brick Court, Middle Temple, EC4, and from 1972 lived at 12 First Street, SW3 and then from 1975 in two houses knocked together at 28 Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea, SW3. Whilst in London he was also a member of the board of management of the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth. Alongside learning and practicing the law he served in the Cambridge University Officer Training Corps (CUOTC), the HAC (within the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve), then in 1972, after meeting its then Colonel, Viscount Monckton, one of whose sisters-in-law happened to be married to one of John's first cousins, transferred to the 9th/12th Royal Lancers (Prince of Wales's). He was with them in Northern Ireland and retired a (Brevet) Major in 1988, having circa 1984 been awarded the Territorial Decoration. The combination of law of war, humanitarian instincts, soldiering and some family precedent (his father had been the Knight of Justice of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem delegate for the revision of the Geneva Convention in July 1929) lead De Salis to become the delegate of International Committee of the Red Cross Missions in Middle East (Beirut, 1982), Africa (Rhodesia), and head of delegation Iraq 1980-81, Thailand 1981-84 (Cambodian refugees), and their special envoy in Lebanon 1982. In July 1983 de Salis wrote: 'It is a heartbreaking fact that ICRC being essentially concerned with the victims of armed conflicts, is more directly concerned operationally with the relief of suffering rather than its abolition. On leaving England and moving to Switzerland he became a special officer in the Swiss Army's Panzergrenadiers, and set about a new career as a financier: as partner of Gautier Salis et Cie Geneva 1989-96, vice-chairman Bank Lips Zurich 1996-98, managing director European Capital Partners (Switzerland) SA 1999-, and as director Amadeus SA Geneva 2000-. In the meantime he had taken over his grandmother's 160 acre farm in the Valle di Buri, Mezzane di Sotto, and developed it from dairy to vineyard. By 2010 Conti de Salis-Soglio Wines Verona had taken shape, partly inspired by his courageous and visionary Valtelline cousin Conte Cesare Sertoli Salis of Tirano and Milan (1952-2005) and his Canua Sforzato, akin to Valpolicella's Amarone. John's eighteenth century ancestors, 3rd Count Peter in particular, had also been growers of hemp and vines in eighteenth century Valtelline. In addition to the above Count de Salis was a member of the British Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta; had the Gold Medal with Swords (Beirut) 1982; was a Knight of Justice of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George; a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the White Elephant (Thailand); and an hereditary Knight of the Golden Spur (Eques Auratus) (1571). He was next male representative of Charles, second and last Viscount Fane and Baron of Loughuyre (aka Lough Gur), and of Vice-Admiral Francis William Drake, of Hillingdon, sometime governor of Newfoundland 1752-4, younger brother of the last Drake baronet of Buckland Abbey, and thus heir-general of Admiral Sir Francis Drake himself. His only listed recreation was melancholia."

In 2002 he also discovered the reason for limited flexion that is frequently noted after knee replacement surgery, and the concept of posterior condylar offset was originated by him. In 2014 he introduced the theory of constitutional alignment, which fundamentally changed modern thinking in knee surgery. He also was influential in the development of the fourth generation artificial knees, and developed the bicruciate stabilised Journey Knee system. Currently he works as a professor of orthopedic surgery in both Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and UZ Leuven."

He left Germany on an emigrant ship the St Pauli in 1842, going first to Nelson where there were a number of German settlers. He went south on the ship Deborah in 1844, and was invited by the Kai Tahu chief Tuhawaiki to make his headquarters on Ruapuke Island.

Jonathan and his brother Samuel came to America from England, and are recorded in Boston in 1641. On May 7, 1650, he is recorded as having sold his land in New Haven to Lancelot Fuller who was married to Jonathan's sister Hannah Marsh. At a town meeting in Norwalk on January 6, 1654, a vote was taken which determined that the settlement's milling apparatus was insufficient, and already commenced improvements would be inadequate. The three settlers who were responsible for the mill at the time, Thomas Fitch, Nathaniel Richards, and Richard Olmsted, were to consult with Lieutenant Samuel Swayn, who built the mill in Stamford. They constructed a dam at the mouth of Mill Brook, and Jonathan Marsh built, \"a corn mill sufficient for all purposes.\" Marsh ran the mill for about six years, and then sold the operation to Richards. Marsh sold his lot to Ephraim Lockwood in 1664. He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founding settlers of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery."

John and his brother Nathaniel remained in England, presumably to manage a farm there and to earn money to send to their father until he had established himself in America. This was a common practice at the time. William arrived in Boston in June 1835, and upon arrival soon married the only widow in the Newton settlement, Hester Mussey. In 1836, the family joined Thomas Hooker in settling Hartford. Shortly after John arrived in Hartford he married Rebecca Beebe.

  "text" : "Gerald Shea \"Jerry\" Sharkey  (April 18, 1942 – April 7, 2014) was an American historic preservationist and historian of the Wright brothers, who conceived the idea for the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park in Dayton, Ohio. The Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, which preserves historic sites used by the Wright Brothers throughout Dayton, was established in 1992. Sharkey had led an alliance of the Wright family, members of the U.S. House of Representatives, the local media and U.S. Federal Judge Walter H. Rice to create the national historical park. Many of the sites associated with the Wight brothers (as well as the surrounding buildings) would likely have been demolished if not for the preservation efforts spearheaded by Sharkey. According to Tom Crouch, a senior curator of aeronautics at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C., Sharkey's efforts helped to \"ensure that what the Wright brothers achieved wouldn’t be forgotten.\" Despite his enthusiasm for the Wrights brothers and their work, Sharkey was reportedly afraid of flying."

  "text" : "(Antoine) Jean-Baptiste Delettrez (1 May 1816 – 25 May 1887) was a renowned 19th-century French clockmaker. Delettrez and Achille Brocot, son of the respected clockmaker Louis-Gabriel Brocot, established the clockmaking company \"Brocot et Delettrez\" in Paris on 20 October 1851, with premises at 62 Rue Charlot. Their speciality was a range of clocks based on the innovations of Brocot père and his other son Antoine, but generally of Achille's greatly advanced original design, some having a unique single-arm double-wheel escapement, some having a temperature-compensated pendulum, some having two dials, one of which showed the time and theother which showed a calendar and often other information such as phases of the moon, times of sunrise & sunset in Paris, etc. The firm was awarded a 1st class prize at the Paris World Exposition of 1857 for a commercial clock of this type. This innovative and fruitful partnership continued until the death of Brocot fils in 1878, after which event Delettrez continued on his own. His typical later product was a conventional 8-day mantle clock that struck the hours and half-hours, still based on the standard Brocot escapement and suspension that he had helped to refine. These elegant and much-admired timepieces were typically made to order for retailers,including several in Britain, with dials carrying the name of the retailer rather than that of their maker, but whose mechanism was stamped with the cartouche (JBD). He married his cousin Caroline Delettrez in Paris on 2 April 1845. They had two sons, Louis and Jules, both of whom later carried on the family tradition of metalworking, the former as a manufacturer of bronze objets d'art and the latter as a goldsmith."

He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1875 to 1877, representing the electorate of Victoria. Ingleby was born in Staffordshire in England, and migrated to South Australia in 1849. He resided in the Mount Gambier region for nearly fifty years prior to his death, living for many years at Glenburnie before moving to Mount Gambier itself several years before his death. In business, he worked as a commission agent, auctioneer and stock broker in Mount Gambier. He was heavily involved in public life in the town, serving as a justice of the peace, as clerk of the Mount Gambier Local Court and clerk of the District Council of Mount Gambier East, as a member of the original committee of the Mount Gambier Institute, and as master of the Mount Gambier Freemason lodge. His brother, Rupert Ingleby, was a prominent Adelaide lawyer who had migrated two years before him. He was elected to the House of Assembly at the 1875 election, but resigned after only two years, stating that he preferred to focus on campaigning for the division of pastoral lands into smaller properties than carrying out the duties of a member of parliament. His brother Rupert nominated for the resulting by-election, but was very narrowly defeated by Lavington Glyde. He died in 1907, aged 78, at \"Inglehurst\", his Mount Gambier home. He had been in good health until about nine months before his death."

  "text" : "Joseph Frederiks II, Nama name: ǃKhorebeb-ǁNaixab (died 20 October 1893 in Bethanie) was a Captain of the ǃAman (Bethanie Orlam), a subtribe of the Orlam. He became Captain when his uncle and stepfather David Christian Frederiks was killed in 1880 in the Battle of Otjikango. Frederiks was party to a land sale deal between the Bethanie Orlam and German merchant Adolf Lüderitz that would eventually establish Imperial Germany's colony of German South-West Africa. Lüderitz in May 1883 obtained the area of Angra Pequena (today the town of Lüderitz) from Frederiks for 100£ in gold and 200 rifles. Three months later on 25 August, Frederiks sold Lüderitz a stretch of land 140 kilometres (87 mi) wide, between the Orange River and Angra Pequena, for £500 and 60 rifles. \n* The contract between Fredericks and Lüderitz, and a map of the sold land  \n* Contract page 1 \n* Contract page 2 \n* Lüderitzland This area, for a short period called Lüderitzland and today part of the Sperrgebiet, was far bigger than Frederiks had thought, as the contract specified its width as \"20 geographical miles\", a term that the tribal chief was not familiar with: 1 German geographical mile equals 7.4 kilometres (4.6 mi), whereas the common mile in the territory was the English mile, 1.6 kilometres. Both Lüderitz and the signing witness, Rhenish missionary Johannes Bam, knew that Chief Frederiks had no idea about geographical miles. He was only concerned about fertile land, and the shore of the Atlantic Ocean was of no value to his tribe. When Frederiks finally became aware of the size of the land he sold, he complained to the German Imperial Government, but Consul-General Gustav Nachtigal died on his return voyage, and the complaint was never delivered. In 1887 \"even the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office doubted the validity of the treaty\". In the wake of the land deal, Frederiks on 28 October 1884 also signed a protection treaty with the German Empire, the second of its kind in German South-West Africa, after the treaty with the Rehoboth Basters two weeks prior. He died on 20 October 1893 in his home village Bethanie, and Paul Frederiks succeeded him as Chief of the ǃAman."
