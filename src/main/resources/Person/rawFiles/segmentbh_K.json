  "text" : "Kenneth Rhyne Harris, Sr. (16 May 1935 – 17 January 2009) was the 48th Mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina serving from 1977 to 1979. Harris was born in Harmony, North Carolina on 16 May 1935 to Roy Lee and Beulah Barker Harris. He attended Iredell County Schools and received his degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Harris was the first Republican Mayor of Charlotte in the twentieth century having been elected in 1977 in what was then considered a major upset. During his term he championed the development of the Charlotte Douglas International Airport including passing a bond issue which resulted in the construction of a new terminal which was instrumental in the growth of the city in the following decades.

In 1877 she wrote Reply to Mr Bradlaugh outlining her opposition, which centred on the internal politics of the secular movement and her desire to disassociate secularism with \"sexual immorality\" of the Owenite movement."

  "text" : "K. K. N. Kurup (born 1939) is an award-winning historian of India and a former vice-chancellor of the University of Calicut. He has specialised in the history of the Malabar region of South India. Kurup obtained a B.A. from the University of Delhi and then studied for his M.A. and PhD at the University of Calicut. He was awarded the latter in 1976. He had been teaching at Calicut since 1972 and continued in various positions there. In 1983, he was professor and head of the history department at the University of Mangalore and was also awarded a professorship at Calicut. He was appointed head of the history department at Calicut in 1991 and in June 1998 became vice-chancellor, at a time when the university was suffering from a decline in staff due to numerous retirements. During his period of office, the fortunes of the institution were revived, its student numbers increased, a new engineering college facility was introduced and tertiary facilities were established in Thrissur, Wayanad and Vadakara. The tertiary bodies were all situated in relatively remote areas and formed part of his \"Knowledge for Villages\" vision. The Malabar Institute of Research and Development is another Kurup innovation, begun at Vadakara in 2002 while he was still vice-chancellor. He was able to devote more time to it after his term of office came to an end in June of that year and now describes it as an organisation of scholars and ordinary citizens who work to embolden the masses through creative and scholarly interventions. MIRD conducts seminars, discussions and debates often in social science. We believe a social scientist is a social engineer and the best way for him to work is through effective arguments. MIRD provides a platform for that. Kurup is a Senior Research Fellow of the Indian Council of Historical Research. He specialises in agrarian relations, colonial history and folklore, especially in the region of Kerala, which used to be a part of Malabar. He was General President of the 1991 South Indian History Congress at Dharwad and President of the Modern Session at the Indian History Congress held in Mysore in 1993. Among his numerous other offices has been that of Director-General of the Centre for Heritage Studies operated by the Government of Kerala. Various awards have been made to Kurup, including the 2010 T. K. Ramakrishnan Prize awarded by Abu Dhabi Sakthi and the 1981 K. Damodaran award for the best work in Malayalam on a social science topic."

  "text" : "Kristian Bakken (11 June 1888 – 20 December 1954) was a Norwegian labourer and politician for the Labour and Communist parties. He was a plate worker by vocation, and worked in Hamar. He was a leading figure in the local Union of Iron and Metalworkers from 1907 until his death, was the second chairman of Hamar faglige samorg and was also a co-founder of the Socialist Youth Association in the city in 1911. He was elected to Hamar city council in 1917, and as the socialists gradually gained ground in the city council he became deputy mayor in 1932–1933. He was promoted to mayor of Hamar in 1935, when his predecessor Sigurd Pedersen was hired as burgomaster and as such was no longer eligible. He won re-election in the Norwegian local elections, 1937. Bakken was a member of the splinter Communist Party during the 1920s, but in 1926 he was—together with Fredrik Monsen and Olav Larssen—one of the main proponents for a reunification with the Labour Party. The majority of Hedmark Communist Party did not agree, but Bakken was instrumental when the minority rejoined the Labour Party in 1927. During the early stages of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, in 1940, Bakken was deposed as mayor. In January 1944 he was arrested by the authorities and imprisoned in Grini concentration camp until May. He was then shipped to Sachsenhausen concentration camp and remained here until the liberation of the camps. After the war he returned to his legitimate position as mayor, but relinquished it in 1946. He died in 1954."

His time, set on 11 May 1996, made him the second Japanese man to run a sub-four-minute mile, after Takashi Ishii, who had done so nearly twenty years earlier in 1977. Shibata's 1500 metres best of 3:39.45 minutes is also among the best times for the event by a Japanese, behind Fumikazu Kobayashi and Ishii. Despite his breaking a long-standing national record, Shibata only won at the Japan Championships in Athletics on one occasion, taking the 1500 m title in 1997. That same year he won a gold medal in the event at the East Asian Games in a then games record time of 3:49.90 minutes. The following year he won the second and final international medal of his career at the 1998 Asian Athletics Championships by finishing as runner-up behind multiple Asian champion Mohamed Suleiman. He also ran at the 1998 Asian Games and placed seventh in the 1500 m final. He represented his home region, Toyama Prefecture, twice at the All-Japan Interprefectural Ekiden Championships."

  "text" : "Kenneth J. \"Ken\" Block (born October 11, 1965) is an American businessman, software engineer, and political reformer. He is the founder of the Moderate Party of Rhode Island, the state's third-largest political party, and ran as the Moderate candidate for Governor of Rhode Island in the 2010 election. While leader of the Moderate Party, Block was an advocate for economic, educational, and political reforms in Rhode Island. His court battle to gain official state recognition for the Moderates in 2009 overturned several unconstitutional laws and made it easier for third parties to gain signatures and access election ballots. In a highly contested four-way election, Block received 6.5% of the vote in the Governor's Race. Block emerged as one of the most outspoken critics of the Rhode Island General Assembly in the aftermath of the 2010 elections. He publicly opposed the controversial $75 million loan and subsequent taxpayer bailout of 38 Studios, the taxpayer-funded redevelopment the Superman Building, and introduction of the Sakonnet River Bridge toll. Block has also called for the elimination of the \"master lever\" from election ballots which he argues creates voter disenfranchisement and unfairly benefits larger political parties. He eventually created MasterLever.org to explain his position and enable the public to contact state officials via e-mail. As a small business owner, Block has run several software companies which have worked with state governments to identify fraud and government waste in social service and welfare programs. In 1995, Block was able to save the state of Texas over $1 billion by developing a new statewide debit card system. Shortly after the 2010 election, Block offered his company's help free of charge to find waste and fraud in Rhode Island's entitlement programs. He was subsequently involved in the state's Medicare waste and fraud report as well as assisting the Providence Police Department's fraud unit to better access state records in late-2012. Police investigators have claimed that the new computer software will help detect millions of dollars in fraud. He also served as president of RI Taxpayers, a taxpayer advocacy and watchdog group, until his resignation in May 2013 when he announced his candidacy for governor in the 2014 election. In October 2013, Block announced that he had joined the Rhode Island Republican Party and intended to challenge Cranston Mayor Allan Fung in the upcoming Republican primary. He has based his campaign on a plan to save Rhode Island taxpayers $1 billion by eliminating wasteful spending."

In 1893 he married Kristine Marie Birkeland, a daughter of Supreme Court Justice Laurits Birkeland. Their son Arne Meidell became a known industrial leader. Another son, Frants, followed in his father's footsteps as a barrister. Garup Meidell finished his secondary education in 1885 and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.jur. degree in 1890. He worked under his father before settling as an attorney in Kristiania in 1893. From 1896 he was a barrister with access to working with Supreme Court cases. Among others he worked as a lawyer for the Central Bank of Norway, and at his death he was described as one of the \"best known jurists\" in Norway's capital. He notably took part in the liquidation of Den norske Discontobank in 1901 and Industribanken in 1902. He was also appointed by the state to the control committee of Andresens og Bergens Kreditbank, when this bank was placed under public administration in 1923. He chaired the supervisory council of Elektrisk Bureau, and was a board member of the Norwegian Bar Association. He died in July 1926 at Modum Bad."

  "text" : "Kate Fodor is an American playwright and a 2013 Guggenheim fellow in playwriting. Her debut play, Hannah and Martin, opened Off-Broadway on March 20, 2004 by the Epic Theatre Ensemble. The play, based on the relationship between political theorist Hannah Arendt and philosopher Martin Heidegger, received favorable reviews: Margo Jefferson in The New York Times called the play \"thoughtful and ambitious\"; in Variety, Marilyn Stasio said, \"Strong on craft, Fodor handles the structural logistics like a clever mathematician patiently working her way through a tricky formula.\"  The play won the Roger L. Stevens Award from the Kennedy Center Fund for New American Plays and a Joseph Jefferson Citation for New Work. It was also a finalist for the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize. Fodor followed this with the play 100 Saints You Should Know, also Off-Broadway, at Playwrights Horizons, in September 2007, about a priest in the midst of his own spiritual crisis interacting with a small galaxy of people experiencing theirs as well. Ben Brantley of The New York Times took issue with what he described as the play's \"Platonic\" tone that resulted in \"a static collection of portraits,\" but acknowledged, \"Ms. Fodor has a fine sense of the forms of emotional aggression, passive and otherwise, that can infuse even the most banal exchanges between parents and children\" and \"a good ear for the kinks and curls of speech of people of different generations and education.\" The play was called \"one of the year's 10 best\" by Entertainment Weekly and TimeOut New York in 2007 and went on to productions in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and St. Louis, among others. The play won the Roger L. Stevens Award from the National Theatre Conference. Her next play, the romantic comedy Rx, represented a shift in tone, exploring in a satiric way the vagaries of the powers of the pharmaceutical industry; it also debuted Off-Broadway, at Primary Stages, on Jan. 24, 2012. Its reviews were positive, with Charles Isherwood from The New York Times praising its \"winning combination of light satire and romance\" and deeming the production a \"Critic's Pick\" Fodor's play \"Fifty Ways\" was the inaugural commission in the new plays program at Chautauqua Theater Company, the professional theater company of the Chautauqua Institution. The play was produced there in 2012. Fodor's plays have been published or excerpted in a number of anthologies and are published by Dramatists Play Service. Fodor has been a fellow at the Playwrights Center in Minneapolis. She is a resident playwright at New Dramatists in New York and a member of the New Play Frontiers program at People's Light & Theater Company in Malvern, Pennsylvania. She has taught playwriting at the University of Pennsylvania."

  "text" : "Kai Henrik Väinö Wartiainen (born 1953 in Kouvola) is a Finnish architect and former academic. He is the son of architect Henrik Wartiainen. Wartiainen was professor of urban planning at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden in 1997-2006. After working for his father, he first founded Kai Wartiainen Architects in Helsinki. Then, between 2004 and 2010 he became a partner and Creative Director in Evata – at the time the largest architectural firm in Finland. He became creative director of Pöyry Architects between 2008-2011. In 2000 he founded the Stockholm planning firm ajö´ tristess with architect Ingrid Reppen, though in 2011 it changed its name to arkitektur + development. Among Wartiainen's realised building designs include the High Tech Center (HTC), Ruoholahti, Helsinki (2001), the Grani Shopping Centre, Kauniainen (2001), Karkkila town hall and library (1991) and Itä-Pasila urban insertions (2005). Wartiainen has won several international competitions, including France's first ecological house in Paris, at Parc de la Villette (2000), and the Nordic First Waterfront Project for the Holmen industrial landscape of Norrköping, Sweden. In 1997 Wartiainen was selected to lead the research in defining the ecological criteria for Finland's first eco-village, Eko-Viikki. Together with a work group, he drew up the so-called PIMWAG criteria (the name was derived from the initials of the members), i.e. 5 factors to be taken into account in assessing the level of ecology of a scheme: pollution, the availability of natural resources, health, the biodiversity of nature, and nutrition. In addition to ecological issues, Wartiainen has also been a controversial champion of libertarianism and the so-called \"innovation culture\" typified by the internet, and criticises the inflexibility of the state-driven norms of urban planning practice. He plots a historical line of development from the \"full control\" of autocrats to the \"instrumental control\" of what he terms expert dictatorship to the ultimate goal of the \"out of control\" of co-creation, and whereby professional urban design and planning expertise is ultimately replaced by urban management."

  "text" : "Katherine Whitney Curtis (January 4, 1897 - July 6, 1980), also spelled \"Katharine\" or \"Kay\" Curtis, is widely credited as the originator of synchronized swimming. While historical figures such as Esther Williams and Annette Kellerman are recognized for similar contributions, important historical details regarding the origin of the word \"Synchronized Swimming,\" its reference to the Olympic sport, and the technical structure of that sport are all credited to Curtis. The only descendants of Katherine's family survive through her nephew, Gaylord Whitney, in central Ohio. Her great-grand nephew, Jordan Whitney Wei, is both the writer and primary researcher for her first comprehensive biography. Kay Curtis introduced synchronized swimming in 1934 at the Chicago World's Fair with Norman Ross as her announcer. To her, synchronized swimming was a co-ed sport as it still might be if she hadn't been transferred overseas (1943-1962) with the Red Cross as recreational director. One of her early disciples was Hal Henning. She staged a production for the Armed Forces in the spectacular fountains and pools and gardens of the palace built by the Kings of the Two Sicilys and used as Allied headquarters in Caserta, Italy. When she finally returned home in 1962 after observing synchronized swimming all over Europe, her baby was a full-blown sport and has been a dominant American aquatic sport and art form ever since. Her pioneer book \"Rhythmic Swimming\" was a classic textbook on the sport she originated. Her no nonsense ability to say it like it is made her not only the tough mother of synchronized swimming but led the late Bill Bachrach to call Kay Curtis \"the only person I was ever jealous of in swimming\"."

He taught himself the flute while learning violin, horn, trumpet, clarinet, bassoon, oboe, cello and double bassoon. Kummer was taught by Neumeister for a year, then took training in music theory from the Cantor of Schleusingen, Gottlob Abraham Stäps. From 1835, he worked as a flautist at the chapel of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and took over direction of their orchestra in 1854. His published compositions ran to over 150 opus numbers, mostly involving the flute, but also including lieder, etc. He also had several students, including Friedrich Kiel and Felix Draeseke. He died in May 1870, probably 21 May, in Coburg."

  "text" : "Kathleen Basford (6 September 1916 – 20 December 1998) was a British botanist, with a special interest in genetics. In 1952, while studying at the University of Manchester, she discovered a form of fuchsia that was a cross between a New Zealand and Mexican fuchsia, proving this form of flower existed 20–30 million years ago, before the continents had separated. This earned her a job at the Botany Department at the University of Manchester, where she worked with geneticist S.C. Harland. She later worked at the Department of Diagnostic Cytology at Christie Cancer Hospital, where she worked until her retirement. She is also known for her research into the cultural significance of the Green Man, a mythical figure who had a head that sprouted foliage. In 1978, she published The Green Man, discussing how the figure was a motif for the \"spiritual dimension of nature\" in architecture, with an important relevance in modern society."

When the Yongle Emperor decided to transfer the capital from Nanjing to Beijing in 1407, Kuai Xiang was ordered to design and construct the Forbidden City for him. Kuai Xiang was in his early thirties when the Emperor commissioned him to design the Forbidden City. Kuai used the Imperial Palace in Nanjing as a model. He included features of palaces built during the Tang and Song dynasties into his design. He also drew from Confucian, Taoist, and traditional astronomical systems. This took Kuai several years, and the first palace and walls of the City were completed only after 13 years."

  "text" : "Kuhl & Leyton are a contemporary visual collaborative by artists Brad Kuhl and Monique Leyton. The artists create art using colored tape, acrylic tape, packing tape, and bookbinding tape. Kuhl & Leyton's visual art is part of the broader genre of social commentary. Brad Kuhl and Monique Leyton met at DASH (Design and Architecture High School) in Miami, FL. They both received a BFA from Cornell University in 2005 where they began collaborating while abroad in Rome, Italy in 2003. Influences on their art include their hometown of Miami, Cops (TV series), CSI: Miami, medical shows and reality shows. One of their famous visual-art series, which was created in 2012, was \"Elite Deviance\". This body of artwork was created using colored tape on paper. It is a visual exploration of white-collar crimes of the past decade such as the Enron scandal, Martha Stewart's involvement with the ImClone stock trading case, the Bernie Madoff investment scandal, the Jack Abramoff CNMI scandal, and the Stanford Financial Group Ponzi scheme. \"Elite Deviance\" was first displayed at CSUF Grand Central Art Center in 2013. The duo are currently living and working on art in Beijing, China."

  "text" : "Klaus J. Kohler (born 1935 in Karlsruhe) is one of the leading German phoneticians. After leaving school in 1954, Klaus Kohler studied English, French, German, and Phonetics at the universities of Heidelberg, Besançon/France, and Edinburgh/Scotland, obtaining degrees at the universities of Heidelberg and Edinburgh. His 1964 PhD thesis was entitled Aspects of the History of English Pronunciation in Scotland. He was lecturer at the university of Edinburgh from 1961 to 1966 and taught at the university of Bonn from 1966 to 1971. In 1971 followed his appointment to the newly created Chair of Phonetics in the Faculty of Arts of the University of Kiel, and to the directorship of an independent Department of Phonetics, subsequently founded in the same year. Kohler was Director of this Department until 2002. Between 1971 and 2006, he carried out a large number of German Research Council (DFG) funded projects into segmental and prosodic sound structures of High and Low German, English, and French. From 1973 to 2005 he was the Editor of the Institute Work-in-Progress series Arbeitsberichte des Instituts für Phonetik der Universität Kiel (AIPUK). One of the international convention he organized was a 1989 meeting of the International Phonetic Association (IPA) to revise the international phonetic alphabet (known as the \"Kiel Convention\"). Kohler's research areas comprise prosody and intonation of German, development of the Kiel Intonation Model (KIM) and of prosodic labelling (PROLAB) on the basis of this model, as well as the implementation of this model in German text-to-speech synthesis."

Seymour began in song and dance routines at a very young age and would go on to appear in a string of highly successful long-running musicals staged at London's Gaiety Theatre during the 1890s.

The third national conference of the All Nepal Peasants Association elected him as its general secretary. After the foundation of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) (CPN(UML)), Badal was made secretary of the Kavre District Committee of the party and included in its National Council.

  "text" : "Kurt Noll, also known as K.L. Noll, is an American biblical scholar, historian, educator and author. He is currently Associate Professor and Chair of the Religion Department at Brandon University in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada where he teaches Judaism, Christianity, biblical languages and Islam. He holds a PhD and a Master of Theology from Union Theological Seminary in Virginia (now called Union Presbyterian Seminary), as well a Master of Arts (Honors) from Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg and a Bachelor of Arts (Summa Cum Laude) from Shippensburg University. Prior to entering academia, he was a professional illustrator and designer. His books include The Faces of David (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997), Canaan and Israel in Antiquity: An Introduction (London: Sheffield Academic Press/Continuum, 2001), and Canaan and Israel in Antiquity: A Textbook on History and Religion (London: T&T Clark/Bloomsbury, 2012). He has also published a number of articles and reviews. Noll is the author of a chapter in Is This Not the Carpenter? The Question of the Historicity of the Figure of Jesus (edited by Thomas L. Thompson and Thomas S. Verenna. London: Equinox, 2012) entitled “Investigating Earliest Christianity without Jesus”. The article methodically explains how it is possible that a literal Jesus was invented as a \"Darwinian strategy\" by the early church to persuade people to become Christians. Although his article tends to support the Christ Myth Theory, he concludes, however, that the lack of historical accuracy in the gospels is not proof that Jesus did not exist, and ultimately, it is not important if he lived or not explaining it “is irrelevant to an understanding of the earliest social movements that evolved into the religion now called Christianity.”"

  "text" : "Karoline Nemetz (married name: Ettemark; born 28 June 1958) is a Swedish former middle- and long-distance runner. Nemetz grew up in Eskilstuna and began competing in athletics and skiing. She eventually settled on running as her focus and made her breakthrough at national level in 1978 by winning the 1500 metres and 3000 metres titles at the Swedish Athletics Championships. She followed this up by retaining those titles the following season and also taking the cross country running short race title. Nemetz won her first major medal at the 1980 World Championships in Athletics. This was a two-event competition created by the International Amateur Athletics Federation in response to the lack of the women's 400 metres hurdles and 3000 m run at the 1980 Summer Olympics. Nemetz took the 3000 m silver medal behind Birgit Friedmann. Her runner-up time of 8:50.22 minutes was a new Swedish record and she was the first to beat Inger Knutsson's Swedish time for that distance. Nemetz's time stood for almost sixteen years, at which point Sara Wedlund improved the mark by a second and a half. Nemetz also retained her Swedish short cross country title, but Katharina Jönnå and Birgit Bringslid took that year's Swedish track titles. She won the 3000 m at the 1980 DN Galan in Stockholm. In 1981 Nemetz won her third 3000 m national title. She also set two further Swedish records: running 15:59.84 for the 5000 metres at the Bislett Games, and 2:37:06 hours for the marathon when placing sixth at the 1981 New York City Marathon. Nemetz was awarded the Stora grabbars märke award at the end of the season. Her career abruptly came to a halt in 1982 as she suffered an Achilles tendon injury. The subsequent operation affected her ability to train and she retired from the sport."

  "text" : "Ken Dennis (May 13, 1937 – April 7, 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada) was an American track and field athlete. As a Masters sprinter he held the world record in the 100 metres in several age groups. Standing 5'3\" the short Dennis was known for his soft spoken nature, his greetings of \"Hey man\" or \"Go man\" and his blazing fast starts. Dennis first began sprinting at Fremont High School in Los Angeles where he opened eyes with a 9.5 100 yard dash before transferring to Centennial High School in Compton. At Centennial, he was joined by Charles Dumas, who had transferred from Jefferson High School. One year removed from winning the Olympic gold medal and being the first person to jump 7 feet, Dumas winning the high jump was a foregone conclusion. But it was Dennis' 13 points winning the 100, second in the 220 and 4x220 yard relay that led Centennial to the overall team title at the CIF California State Meet in 1955. Dennis was the top high school 100 yard dash man nationwide that year. Dennis ran collegiately for the University of California. On September 23, 1983, Dennis set the M45 World Record in the 100 metres at 10.92 in the heats before winning the World Masters Athletics Championships in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His time in the final was 11.03, was intrinsically superior to Thane Baker's existing hand timed world record of 10.8. His record would last for almost 7 years. Almost four years later, August 14, 1987, Dennis again ran 11.03, this time to set the M50 World Record in the 100 metres at the USATF Masters Championships in Springfield, Oregon. That record would last almost 15 years before being surpassed by Bill Collins. He won the World Masters Championships in the 100m in 1987 a breath ahead of long time rival Reginald Austin of Australia, himself a former world record holder, who was running on home soil in Melbourne. Both were timed in 11.24. In 1989, on American soil in Eugene, Oregon Dennis handily beat Austin to take another world title. Austin got his revenge winning the 200 metres while Dennis finished second. The next time the two met in the World Championships was 1995 in Buffalo, New York, where Austin came from behind to catch the quick starting Dennis in extremely windy conditions. On June 24, 2000 he joined rivals Harold Tolson, Doug Smith and Gary Simms in setting the M60 American record in the 4 x 100 metres relay at the Southern California USATF Masters Age Group Championships. That record was surpassed in 2011. On August 8, 2003, Dennis ran 12.40 to win the USATF Masters Championships again in Eugene in the M65 division ahead of Tolson and Simms.see the race This was the first time anyone had run better than the listed world record 12.53 by Payton Jordan set the same day Dennis ran his M45 record in San Juan. Unfortunately the race was wind aided. A fixture at Southern California track meet, after retiring Dennis moved to Las Vegas. He had to undergo double bypass surgery in 2007, but died during a procedure on his knee."

Marsden was dogged after her journey by homophobia, her finances were questioned as were her motives for the her journey. Her accusers almost succeeded in making her sexuality the basis for an \"Oscar Wilde\"-type trial. She was however elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.

He medaled for Chinese Taipei at the Asian Athletics Championships six times, winning one gold medal, two silver, and three bronze. At the 1990 Asian Games, he earned a silver medal in the decathlon. Upon retiring from athletics, he became a physical education teacher. On 24 August 1999, an explosion onboard a landed Uni Air plane injured 28 people and killed Ku Jing-chi (C: 古金池, P: Gǔ Jīnchí), the older brother of Ku Chin-shui. A report from the Aviation Safety Council (ASC) said a motorbike battery jostled, igniting gasoline in bottles in an overhead compartment. Prosecutors accused Ku Chin-shui of asking his nephew to bring gasoline on the flight. Ku was convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison. Upon appeal, it was shortened to seven and a half years. After a fifth retrial, he was declared not guilty. The ASC had commissioned an analysis from the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, which said the ASC's simulation environment differed from that of the aircraft which had exploded.\" The court case caused Ku to lose his teaching position, and he worked part-time at a steel factory until 2008, when he returned to teaching full time. Ku was diagnosed with cancer in 2014, and died of plasma cell leukemia on 25 May 2016 at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei. Aged 56 at the time of his death, Ku was survived by his wife and two children."

He was primarily known as Kenneth Kilstrom. He was an apprentice of Isamu Noguchi and a member of Stanley Hayter's Atelier 17. While working with Hayter in his New York Atelier 17 in 1948, he became the first artist known to have used the direct transfer of \"real world\" photographic imagery on to an intaglio printing plate as an element in a composition in his work \"Attack on Marshall Gilbert\". Kilstrom produced fifteen of these prints, two of which are held by the National Archives and the Fogg Museum at Harvard University."

He improved to 10.34 to win at the 2010 Penn Relays. At the Jamaican Athletics Championships he ran a new best of 10.13 seconds in the semi-final, then placed third in the 100 m final. He competed in Europe for the first time that year with a win at the Weltklasse in Biberach being his highlight. He was twice runner-up on the 2011 Brazilian Athletics Grand Prix circuit. Roach failed to improve upon his best or make the Jamaican 100 m final that year and the two years after. A performance of 6.59 seconds in the 60 metres to take third at the 2014 Millrose Games gained him selection for the 2014 IAAF World Indoor Championships. In the semi-final he had a personal best run of 6.55 seconds, but was a little slower in the final, placing eighth in a close race."

  "text" : "Kathryn Ann Woolard (born 1950 in Wellsville, New York) is a Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, San Diego. She specializes in linguistic anthropology, with particular interests in language ideologies and sociolinguistic issues in Catalonia. Woolard received a Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of California at Berkeley. Woolard served as the president of the Society for Linguistic Anthropology, a section of the American Anthropological Association, from 2009 to 2011. Woolard studies social relations and language use from an anthropological perspective, viewing language as a tool for communication, a means of social action, and a way of understanding the world. From this point of view, Woolard's analyses can be framed within current critical sociolinguistics, as her work integrates sociolinguistic theory and social theory. Within this perspective, the ideas that individuals and groups have about language and linguistic practices are understood as expressions of different views of society and social organization. Other scholars associated with critical sociolinguistics include Pierre Bourdieu and Mikhail Bakhtin. Based on ethnographic investigation, Woolard analyzes the place of authority and authenticity in people's understanding of language and social order, particularly as these concepts are understood in Catalonia related to changes in the national language project and the status of Catalan and Castilian in contemporary Catalonia after thirty years of political autonomy within Spain."

Upon the release of SK Telecom's 'game-changing' product, popular tech website eGadget reviewed \"Atti\", stating: \"Atti\" is Korean for buddy or friend and judging by how he (or she?) and Brad got along we'd suggest robo is aptly named. Using a phone snapped into the top of the head, the robot reacts to <your> interaction with it via camera and a wand attachment that sits in Atti's hand while not in use.\" In February 2016, she began hosting JEI TV's brainchild, FULL SENTENCE ENGLISH, and was credited with shaping its learning focus based on her background in voice acting and professional experience in story board generation, eventually establishing a franchise. She is currently a co-host on EBSe's \"English news\", an unusual broadcast combining Korean and English, and using AP content and improv. Frances is a graduate of Denis Morris Catholic High School, and Brock University, in St. Catharines."

  "text" : "Kathleen Andrews (née Smith, May 17, 1940 – November 17, 2013) was a British-Canadian bus driver and transport manager. Her pioneering role as the first female Transit Operator, Dispatcher and Manager in Edmonton, Alberta was later commemorated by the city. Kathleen Smith grew up in Rochdale, Lancashire and migrated to Edmonton aged 14. She graduated from Ross Sheppard Composite High School in 1959. Following a marriage and subsequent divorce, she sought full-time employment to support her family, which led to joining the Edmonton Transit System (ETS) in 1975. She initially fulfilled the role of Bus Information Clerk, before becoming the first female bus driver that May. After three years, she became the first female Bus Dispatcher, and was eventually promoted to manager of Special Service charter buses. She was commended by the council as being the first female in any significant management capacity in the city. She continued to drive school buses after her retirement from ETS in 1998, and died of cancer in November 2013. In 2014, the city council created the Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage at a cost of $196 million, covering 500,000 square feet of space and accommodating 300 buses and 700 drivers."

After connecting with Tibetan Buddhism he met and trained under many Tibetan masters, including his root Gurus Dudjom Rinpoche Jigdral Yeshe Dorje and Kanjur Rinpoche Longchen Yeshe Dorje. He lived near these masters in Darjeeling, West Bengal, for many years. He studied the Tibetan language at Queens College, Sanskrit University, in Varanasi, India, under Lama Jamspal. In 1973, at the Nyingma Institute in Berkeley, California, his translations were first published under the auspices of Tarthang Tulku, while he taught on Tibetan language at Sonoma State College. Dowman has written books and translations focusing on various aspects of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan culture including travel literature in particular on Buddhist Tantra and Dzogchen. In his later writings he has focused increasingly on Dzogchen and in particular on the works of the 14th Century Nyingma master scholar Longchenpa. Since 1993 he has been teaching and leading retreats on Vajrayana and Dzogchen throughout the world."

  "text" : "Kasim Hafeez is a British Muslim of Pakistani origin, best known for founding \"The Israel Campaign\", a pro-Israel advocacy organization. Hafeez is a self-proclaimed Muslim Zionist, who claims that much of the hatred and intolerance of Israel in the Arab world stems from ignorance. Hafeez says that as a British Muslim household born to parents of Pakistani origin, he has been indoctrinated in his teens to become anti-Israeli and antisemitic. Hafeez has radically changed his views after reading The Case for Israel by Alan Dershowitz, and this shift eventually compelled him to reach out to Israeli advocacy groups. According to Hafeez, it's \"far from easy being a Zionist Muslim in England\". Hafeez said he's been marginalized by his community and family. Hafeez, who has found an appreciation for Sufi Islam, stated in a lecture that he felt more at home in Israel than anywhere else, and added \"I'm proud to call myself a Zionist\". Hafeez visited university campuses around the UK presenting his talk, \"The Day I Stopped Hating Israel – Confessions of an ex-Radical.\" In an interview with the Jewish Telegraph, Hafeez said: \"It's not about being pro-Israel or pro-truth, I just want the facts to be heard. Israel is a democratic state. Muslims in Israel have more rights than possibly most Muslims in the Arab world and then there is the reality of the actual conflict. In the UK, most of us can't impact what will happen in Israel, we can't stop rockets falling from Gaza or forge a peace process, but we can tackle the delegitimisation and demonisation of Israel.\""

  "text" : "Kurt Huldschinsky (* 1883 in Berlin; † 15 December 1940 in Alexandria, Egypt) was a German Pediatrician of Polish heritage (Prussian). He served in the Wehrmacht as a field medic in WWI. Later, as a medical doctor and research scientist, he successfully demonstrated in the winter of 1918/1919 how rickets could be treated with Ultra-violet lamps. At that time perhaps half of all German children suffered from rickets. It was already understood that this disease was caused by Calcium deficiency. Up to that point, heliotherapy was a common protocol for many illnesses and showed promise in relieving the effects of rickets. The bio-chemical mechanism triggered in the human dermis by the sun's electromagnetic radiation was not fully understood, and scientists were exploring mostly the long wavelength (red) end of the spectrum. To generate artificial UV, Dr. Huldschinsky originally tried to adapt existing X-Ray technology. As Dr. Huldschinsky was Jewish, he needed to flee Germany so emigrated himself, his Christian wife Maria (nėe Straßer) and their only child Eva to Egypt in 1934. There, he continued his professional work in healthcare delivery and published further medical science articles. It was there in Alexandria where he died on 15 December 1940 from malignant hyperthermia after a minor operation to deal with a thrombosis."
