In 1988, Ringnald, at 18, was the youngest male member of a U.S. Olympics Team since 20 years before. At that competition, Ringnald made the all around finals, where he placed 35th. In 1989, he was a member of the US men's World Team. In 1990, at the Goodwill Games, he had one of his best international results, earning a gold medal on the high bar and bronze medals in the all around and parallel bars. In 1991, he was again a member of the men's World Championships team. That same year, he suffered a torn chest muscle (pectoralis major). One of his few injuries requiring surgery, it happened 10 months before the 1992 Olympics. Ringnald was able to make the 1992 team (as an alternate), which he was grateful for. In 1993, he was again a member of the men's World team, but, later that year, he retired from competition. Since his retirement, Ringnald has been a cruise ship entertainer, combining gymnastic performance with discussion of his experiences as well as juggling. He also gives seminars on different methods of memorizing lists, facts, numbers, peoples' names, etc."

  "text" : "Loly Rico is the president of the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants. She is married to Francisco Rico-Martinez, with whom she co-directs the Toronto-based Faithful Companions of Jesus Refugee Centre. Rico and her family moved to Canada as refugees in 1990 in order to escape political repression in El Salvador. In 2004, the Toronto City Council gave her the Constance E. Hamilton Award on the Status of Women. In 2008, Rico was given the Trevor Bartram Award by the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture. When Joy Smith released \"Connecting the Dots\", a proposal for the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, Rico criticized the proposal for being too focused on those who create the demand for sex trafficking, saying that it therefore did not sufficiently address victim rehabilitation. She recommended, therefore, that the proposal be amended to allow human trafficking victims to become permanent residents of Canada and therefore be better guarded against being trafficked again. Rico became the president of the Canadian Council for Refugees in 2012. In 2013, Rico remarked that, \"unfortunately, the government has been closing the door on refugees.\" Specifically, she criticized Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, for having promised that Canada would resettle more refugees from 2011-2012 than in previous years, but not following through on this promise; instead, there was a 26% drop in refugee resettlement in Canada during that period, hitting a 30-year low."

He recorded his experiences in a manuscript entitled \"Mémoire sur la première guerre des Natchez.\" He subsequently served in the French capture of Pensacola, Florida during the War of the Quadruple Alliance in 1719. According to the narrative by Dumont de Montigny, he was appointed to command a ship carrying Spanish prisoners to Havana, Cuba for ransom, only to be taken prisoner himself. Spanish forces then expropriated the vessel and returned to Pensacola, entering the harbor flying French colors and pretending to be under the command of Richebourg. After being ransomed from the Spanish at the end of the war, Richebourg was subsequently appointed royal lieutenant at the newly founded city of New Orleans in 1722, but sailed back to France that same year."

McGibbon was born in Byker, Newcastle upon Tyne on 8 October 1931 and died in Brampton, Northamptonshire on 22 September 2012. He scored 17 runs with a highest score of 4 and took 33 wickets with a best performance of four for 42. McGibbon provided much of the financial backing for the management buyout of Harbilt Electric Trucks from its parent companies Crosby Valves and Edward Le Pas in 1975. The company were based in Market Harborough, and briefly traded as McGibbon until the registration of the new limited company was completed."

At age 13 he quit school to work full-time during the Great Depression.

He was also a drug runner and did time in prison for tax evasion. His family lives in Chokoloskee. \"While life in the Everglades was no picnic, the privilege of living a free life that close to nature was worth all the hardships that came with it: coping with alligators, panthers, and rattlesnakes on muddy lands filled with poison ivy, spiders, and mosquitoes so thick you could rake `em off your brow by the handful.\""

  "text" : "Lee M. Hill full name Leighton McLeod Hill (13 March 1907 – 5 June 1952) was a New Zealand film-maker and cinematographer. He was born in Carterton, attended Carterton School and Dannevirke High School, and died in Wellington. He worked for J E Vinsen for ten years and as a freelance. He also worked with Rudall Hayward in the 1920s, making local \"community comedies\", but later made some himself in competition with Hayward e.g. Frances of Fielding. He was an Army photographer in the 2NZEF in World War II, being captured at Sidi Aziz in 1941 and spent several years as a German prisoner-of-war. At the end of the War he was in Oflag IX A/Z at Rotenburg an der Fulda, where he showed German silent films to prisoners. When the camp was marched east in 1945 he took a series of photographs of the march. Examples of these are in the Turnbull Collection, New Zealand. Postwar he was associated with Apex Films Ltd and his own Television Films Ltd. He took over the Vogue Theatre in Brooklyn, Wellington but died suddenly, leaving a wife and family. The obituary does not mention Hollywood, but in an interview with Ronald Sinclair about the filming of Down on the Farm, Phar Lap's Son and The Wagon and the Star Sinclair said that: It was Lee Hill that all of us relied on for guiding us in the production. He came to New Zealand from Hollywood, with a Hollywood background to put to use. Such background was considered vital, and Hill was highly revered by all of us because of the experience he brought with him."

  "text" : "Leslie James Bennett (1920 — October 18, 2003) was a British/Canadian citizen who spent most of his working life as a counter-intelligence official, first for Britain's GCHQ, and later for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)  Security Service. He took an early retirement and moved to Australia. Bennett was born in Wales, served with the British signals intelligence organization GCHQ during World War II. According to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations, Bennett met Kim Philby during World War II, when they were both stationed in Turkey. While living in Australia in 1950 Bennett married an Australian woman. Later that year he and his wife moved to Canada when he began his 22-year employment as a civilian employee of the RCMP According to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations in 1962 the Central Intelligence Agency's chief of counter-intelligence James Jesus Angleton trusted Bennett to interview a key Soviet defector Anatol Golitsyn. However, Angleton, who was known for being highly suspicious, began to suspect that Bennett might himself be a mole. Angleton opened a dossier on Bennett in 1967. By 1970 Angleton's suspicions grew to the point the RCMP had to conduct an investigation into Bennett. They put him under surveillance, tapped his phone, and bugged his house—including his bedroom. This operation, codenamed \"Operation Gridiron\" culminated in taking Bennett to a safehouse for a humiliating five-day interrogation. During his interrogation his interrogators asked Bennett embarrassing personal questions about his sex life based on comments captured from the bug in his bedroom. The investigation did not find any evidence that Bennett was a double agent, but his clearance to have access to top secret information was withdrawn, to satisfy American concerns. According to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations, when Angleton was removed in 1974, it turned out he never had any real evidence Bennett had ever been disloyal. After he left the RCMP his wife left him, and returned to Australia with their two daughters.The Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations asserted that he was only able to get menial work. In 1977 Ian Adams published a short novel entitled S: Portrait of a Spy, about a senior RCMP security official who was a mole.Other commentators would assert that many of the novel's character seemed to be thinly veiled descriptions of real individuals—starting with \"S\", the titular character, who Paul Hellyer and Peter Worthington would identify as Bennett. Worthington contacted Bennett, strongly encouraging him to sue Adams.During the civil suit the judge required Adams to name his sources, but allowed Bennett to refuse to testify on the grounds that doing so might reveal secrets that would put national security at risk. Adams and Bennett reached an out of court settlement. Bennett was paid $30,000—reported to be barely enough to pay his legal expenses. In 1982 John Sawatsky published For Services Rendered: Leslie James Bennett and the RCMP Security Service, which he presented as a more thorough, professional examination of Bennett's career. In 1985 another Soviet defector, Vitali Sergeyevich Yurchenko confirmed there was a Soviet mole in the RCMP, but identified him as another official. According to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations the actual mole was Sergeant Gilles G. Brunet. In 1993 The Fifth Estate, an investigative journalism television program from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, profiled Bennett, and interviewed a former KGB director of foreign counter-intelligence, General Oleg Kalugin, who also confirmed another RCMP official was the mole, and that he had never heard of Bennett.The Fifth Estate also identified the mole as Gilles G. Brunet. According to Dan Mulvenna, a colleague of Bennett, in 1993, after The Fifth Estate profiled Bennett, the then Solicitor General \"exonerated\" Bennett, and he was given a $100,000 payment.Bennett had been a civilian employee of the RCMP, he was not officially a Mountie, but, according to Mulvenna, due to his long service and the respect felt for him, the organization of retired Mounties made him an honorary member."

His photographs often addresses subtle and relevant questions on social, political and cultural issues, such as the relationship with nudity, religion, the environment, war or the fragility of life. Most of the time, he sketches his images, so rarely anything in them has not a specific reason to be."

She was the eldest of six children of Charles Gask, merchant, and his wife Fanny, née Edis. Her brother, Arthur Gask, was also a writer. In 1891 she was recorded in the England and Wales Census as being employed as a \"pupil nurse\" in London. In 1904 her first book, Dog Tales, was published. This was the first of about thirty books published during her lifetime. She frequently collaborated with Dorothy Hardy, a noted animal and equine illustrator. In a review of True Stories about Horses published in The Spectator it was stated that \"some of Miss Lilian Gask's 'True Stories about Horses' are almost incredible, and all are gently sentimental. But they are pleasantly written, and the illustrations, by Mr. Patten Wilson, are spirited and delicate.\" This assessment might apply to Gask's writing in general."

  "text" : "Louis Crompton (born April 5, 1925, Port Colborne, Ontario; died July 11, 2009, El Cerrito, California), son of Master Mariner Clarence and Mabel Crompton, was a Canadian-born scholar, professor, author, and pioneer in the instruction of queer studies. Crompton received an M.A. in mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1948 and a Ph.D. in English from the University of Chicago in 1954. After teaching mathematics at the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto, he joined the English department at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1955, retiring in 1989. During his career, he gained an international reputation as a scholar of the works of George Bernard Shaw. In 1970, Crompton taught a gay studies class at UNL, the second such course offered in the United States, an action that raised LGBT awareness in academia, Nebraska, and the nation. The course provoked one Nebraska state legislator into introducing a bill that would ban any teaching on homosexuality in any Nebraska public college; the bill was not passed into law. However, Crompton decided not to offer the course again, but continued to pursue the subject through research and publication. In the early 1970s, Crompton became the faculty advisor for the Gay Action Group, forerunner of today's UNL Queer Ally Coalition, and also helped found the UNL Homophobia Awareness Committee, which became the Committee on Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Concerns. In 1974, Crompton co-founded the Gay and Lesbian Caucus of the Modern Language Association. In 1978, Crompton scored a literary coup by editing and publishing in the Journal of Homosexuality the full text of \"Offences Against One's Self: Paederasty,\" a never-before published 1785 essay by utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham. Bentham had suppressed the essay during his lifetime, for fear of public outrage at his views on liberalizing the laws concerning homosexual activity. Crompton received many awards and honors during his career, including the Bonnie Zimmerman and Vern L. Bullough Prize of the Foundation for the Scientific Study of Sexuality award for 2003 for his book Homosexuality and Civilization, which covers 2500 years of world history. In 2009, a scholarship was established at UNL in Crompton's name for students working toward \"a more just, inclusive society for the LGBTQ community\"; the first award to a student was made in 2013. At the time of his death, Crompton, who had retired to California, was Professor Emeritus of English at UNL. He was survived by his partner of forty years, Luis Diaz-Perdomo, also a former UNL faculty member who served many years with Counseling and Psychological Services at UNL and facilitated the Gay Men’s Discussion Group."

  "text" : "Lilian Hamilton Jeffery (5 January 1915 – 29 September 1986) was a British archaeologist, classical philologist and epigraphist best remembered for her 1961 work The Local Scripts of Archaic Greece. Building on the work of Adolf Kirchhoff and Antony E. Raubitschek, Jeffery surveyed the development of the Greek alphabet from its adoption down to the fifth century BC and in so doing established the chronology of archaic inscriptions. Lilian (Anne) Jeffery was born at Westcliff-on-Sea to a schoolmaster and lecturer in classics. She was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and in 1933 went up to Newnham College, Cambridge where she studied under Jocelyn Toynbee. She won the Walton Studenship to the British School at Athens in 1937, where she contributed to the work of Antony E. Raubitschek on the sculptural fragments of the Acropolis, co-publishing with him the 1949 book Dedications from the Athenian Akropolis. She served in the WAAF during the war; part of her duties included intelligence interpretation of aerial photographs. In 1946 she took up the position of research fellow at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she remained for the rest of her career apart from a period of research at the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton. Her archaeological work included field study with the British School at Old Smyrna (Bayrakli) in 1949. She also made major contributions to the study of Attic grave monuments and the epigraphical edition project Inscriptiones Graecae i3. Her archive is preserved at the Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents, Oxford, digitised and published online."

The majority of his compositions were vocal music, many of them with texts on religious or existentialist themes. Several of his compositions can be found in the 1986 hymnal for the Church of Sweden. He also set poems by Gunnar Ekelöf and Tomas Tranströmer to music. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 1975. Lars Edlund lived in Uppsala from the 1980s until his death."

Holt and Reano began making pottery together in 1999. At first, Holt made the pots and Reano painted them. They now share the pottery making; Holt still does all the painting. They first made figurines inspired by the old Cochiti tradition of human and animal forms. More recently, they make pots, jars, and figurines with a more contemporary feel, influenced by the work of Holt's uncle, the avant-garde potter and fashion designer Virgil Ortiz. Lisa Holt is from Cochiti Pueblo and is the granddaughter of potter Seferina Ortiz, who was her mentor. She also learned from her mother, Juanita Ortiz, and her uncle, Virgil Ortiz. Harlan Reano is half Kewa Pueblo (Santo Domingo) on his mother’s side. He also learned potting from Juanita Ortiz. They use Cochiti clay and natural paints for their work, and fire their pottery outdoors with cedar wood. Holt and Reano were featured in the 25th Smithsonian Craft Show in 2007. Smithsonian magazine ran a photo of their \"Pueblo Fire Warrior\" figurine. \"He's a superhero we came up with,\" they said. Holt and Reano's works are in the collections of the National Museum of the American Indian, the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture, and the Peabody Essex Museum."

She graduated from Waynesburg College in 1873 and spent several years teaching in public schools. She married Franklin Pierce Iams in 1877, a lawyer involved in the political affairs of the Democratic Party. She served as his secretary and became a successful court stenographer. Iams was active with the Civic Club of Allegheny County and became its first vice president in 1902. She played a critical role in the drafting of a 1903 Pennsylvania tenement law and chaired the Club's Legislative Committee until the 1920s. She also served on the legislative committees of the Associated Charities of Pittsburgh, the Consumers' League of Western Pennsylvania and the Allegheny County Child Labor Associations. According to historian Roy Lubove, \"in a sense she acted as an informal coordinator of reform legislation for western Pennsylvania.\" Iams made an unsuccessful run for Pittsburgh City Council in 1921. The same year she was appointed as a Trustee of the Western Penitentiary of Pennsylvania by Governor Gifford Pinchot. Iams died of pneumonia on October 26, 1924 in Pittsburgh and is interred at Allegheny Cemetery."

  "text" : "Lauchlan Mackinnon (26 February 1817 – 21 March 1888) was a pastoralist, politician and newspaper proprietor in colonial Australia. Mackinnon one of the most enterprising of the pioneer colonists of Victoria (Australia) and one of the proprietors of the Melbourne Argus from 1852 until his death. Mackinnon was born in Kilbride, Isle of Skye, Scotland, the second son of John Mackinnon, a Presbyterian minister of Strath, Skye, and his wife Ann, daughter of Lauchlan Mackinnon of Corriechatachan, Skye. After being educated partly at home and subsequently at Broadford, Mackinnon entered the office of his uncle Mr. Lauchlan Mackinnon, a Writer to the Signet in Glasgow; but preferring a more active life, he in 1838 proceeded to Sydney. In Australia Mackinnon at once engaged in the hazardous business of \"overlanding\", and succeeded in his dangerous mission of conveying stock from Sydney to Adelaide—a feat which attracted much attention at the time, as it was the first overland journey made between these distant points. A little later (in 1840) he made one of the earliest overland journeys with sheep from Sydney to Melbourne. The pastoral capabilities of the country attracted his attention, and he determined to settle in Australia Felix. He took up a run in the western district on the Loddon River, and subsequently removed to Mount Fyans. He was for some years associated in business with the late James Montgomery, and in 1852 he joined Edward Wilson, and became one of the proprietors of the Argus. Prior to this he had taken a prominent part in political life, particularly interesting himself in the agitation for the separation of Port Phillip District from New South Wales. He was one of the representatives for the Electoral district of Port Phillip in the Parliament of New South Wales in 1848, and vigorously supported its claims for justice from the governing authorities of New South Wales. He was a strong and earnest supporter of the anti-convict movement, and took a prominent part in the demonstration which was held in Melbourne in 1849, when the inhabitants resolved to oppose the landing of convicts from the ship Randolph by physical force, and to undergo any extremity of suffering rather than permit the colony to become a receptacle of felons. After separation had been secured, Mackinnon represented the Belfast and Warrnambool district in the old unicameral Victorian Legislative Council, and assisted to pass a measure intended to prevent the introduction of convicted offenders into the colony. He energetically combated the efforts of the imperial authorities to prevent the effective administration of the enactment; and on the popular opposition proving successful he proceeded in 1853 with William Westgarth to Tasmania to assist the anti-transportation party in the colony. Indeed, he took a strong interest in all the public movements of the day; and his vigour and courage were so well recognised that, in the early days when bushrangers were prevalent, he had been offered the command of the police force of Port Phillip—a position which, however, he did not accept. He was one of the members of the original Council of the University of Melbourne, and first Chairman of its Building Committee. When the gold discoveries in Victoria gave such a wonderful impetus to the colony, the vigorous judgment and business ability of Mackinnon, with the brilliant literary qualities of his partner, Edward Wilson, placed the Argus in the van of the Australian press. After some years of arduous work, Mackinnon returned to England, where he remained. He was twice married, his first wife being a daughter of Robert Montgomery, and sister of James Montgomery; and his second, Emily, daughter of Capt. Bundoch, R.N. Mackinnon died in Torquay, Devon, England on 21 March 1888."

  "text" : "Ladislaus Sunthaym (Sunthaym, Sunthaim, Sunthain, Sunthaymer, born c. 1440 in Ravensburg, died 1512 or 1513 in Vienna) was a German historian, genealogist and geographer. He studied theology in Vienna and was elected \"procurator of the Rhenish nation\"(a kind of association of students from the Rhineland in Vienna) in 1460. He received his degree of Baccalaureus artium in 1465 and acted as a priest in Vienna from 1473.Thea abbot of Klosterneuburg in 1485 asked Sunthaym to compile a family history of Leopold III, Duke of Austria in connection with the duke's canonization. Sunthaym worked on a history and genealogy of the Babenberg family until 1489, perusing the histories of Otto von Freising and Thomas Ebendorfer.The finished work was exhibited in Klosterneuburg abbey as a richly illuminated parchment manuscript, the so-called Tabulae Claustroneoburgenses. The manuscript was supplemented by a great triptych based on the Babenberg family tree, made by the workshop of Hans Part during c. 1489 to 1492, for the benefit of the pilgrims visiting Klosterneuburg (now in the monastery museum). In 1491, the work was published in print by Michael Furter of Basel. As a result, Sunthaym became widely known as a historiographer. He was a member of the Sodalitas litteraria Danubiana (\"Danubian literary society\") in 1498, and emperor Maximilian charged Sunthaym with a major project of reviewing the genealogy of the House of Habsburg.In 1504, Sunthaym was a member of the chapter of St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna. In 1505, he presented his Habsburg genealogy to the emperor. Sunthaym's geographical works, covering Austria, Bavaria, Swabia, the Alsace and parts of Franconia, are an important source for the economy and demographics of these regions at. the end of the medieval period."

  "text" : "Leonard Borman (28 April 1894 – 15 August 1995) was a British-born Canadian war veteran and artist. Borman studied art at the Art Institute of Chicago and under Joseph Pennell and George Bellows. He arrived in Sierra Madre, CA in 1920 and was active in the Los Angeles area into the 1950s. He died in Canyonville, OR on Aug. 15, 1995. His mother played violin until her hand was injured in a train door accident, she then took up painting and was teaching young Leonard to draw and paint. Unfortunately she died when he was 3 years old. Leonard and his younger sister went to live with their grandmother. He also attended a boys school and was an apprentice gardener at Kelways Nursery in the United Kingdom 1907 - 1913. In 1914 he went to Manitoba, Canada where he was also an apprentice at the Stephens Nursery. One year later he entered the Canadian Army and fought in France World War I - 1915-1918. After suffering a severe injury to his arm, and while recovering in hospital, he found easy money by coloring black & white photos for the nurses. After recovery he came to the US and studied art at the Art Institute of Chicago under Pennell and Bellows 1919 -1921. He and a fellow artist came to California in 1921 where they visited most of California's Parks, the Grand Canyon and Oregon to draw and paint from nature. In 1921 they built a large studio and Leonard Borman produced some large, beautiful paintings, placed them in massive gold frames and traveled to New York hoping for a successful art sale. The year was 1929 the Wall Street Stock Market Crash sent him home with different plans for his future in art. He decided to paint and sell his works to people of the working class at a price they could afford. In 1932 he gave up the big studio, met and married a young girl from Brighton, England. They opened a picture frame shop and art gallery-studio in Pasadena, CA. It was located next to a very popular restaurant where at night people standing in line to enter became very interested in the fine oil paintings Leonard displayed in his front window. One prominent lady introduced him to the group that would commission hundreds of animal paintings over the next 20 some years. Some of these prominent collectors were: Harold S. Chase of Santa Barbara, Firestone Tire, Singer Sewing Machine, Conard Ship Lines, Pillsbury Co., W.E.Boeing, DuPont, Sebastian Cabot actor, Mae West actress. The air quality in Pasadena CA in the 1920s, 30s & 40s was extremely poor due to smog and was causing Leonard great discomfort so they closed the store in 1955 and moved to the desert. Years earlier the Bormans bought 20 acres with a cabin in the desert, near Joshua Tree, CA. Over the years they turned it into a comfortable home, studio, and art gallery. Leonard Borman painted, while his wife May framed pictures, and his patrons came to buy and place orders for the next 45 years. In 1975 his wife, May, died."

  "text" : "Henri Chapu (1833–1891) was a French sculptor. Chapu was born in Le Mée-sur-Seine on 30 September 1833. He trained at the École Gratuite de Dessin as a tapestry maker. In 1849 his successes led him to the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris, where he became a pupil of James Pradier, François Duret and Léon Cogniet. In 1855 he won the Prix de Rome for sculpture with the relief \"Cleobis and Biton\". He completed his education at the Académie de France in Rome, remaining there until 1861. While there, he worked in the Villa Médicis. During the period of the Second Empire and the Third Republic, Chapu worked on the sculptural decoration of many buildings and public monuments, including the decoration of the façade of the Au Printemps store, the Théâtre de l'Opéra, and the gardens of the Château de Chantilly. Many of Chapu's works take the form of médallions and he is credited with having led a new wave of interest in this medium. In 1867 Chapu was made a chevalier of the Légion d'honneur, in recognition of his works for the Éxposition Universelle of that year, and in 1880 he was elected to the Academie des Beaux-Arts. He died on 21 April 1891 and is buried in Mée-sur-Seine's cemetery."

He claimed it took 10,000 hours to complete and that he devoted an entire summer just to completing construction of the passenger seats. CNET declared the model \"the coolest paper airplane ever\"  while WIRED named Iaconi-Stewart \"the world's best paper plane maker\". According to Iaconi-Stewart, he dropped out of college at Vassar in order to devote more time to constructing the model. In an interview with The Independent, Iaconi-Stewart said his work had been inspired by an effort to \"push the limits of what could be done\" with manila folders. As of 2014, Iaconi-Stewart is employed doing odd jobs in the San Francisco area."

He introduced the term diapir that denotes a type of intrusion in which a more mobile and ductily deformable material is forced into brittle overlying rocks. The phenomenon of \"diapirism\" allows rock salt to provide an effective trap for hydrocarbon deposits. In this way, Ludovik Mrazek explained the distribution of hydrocarbon accumulations in the Neogene Carpathian. Diapirism is commonly used as a basic concept in geological survey as well as in Planetary science."

The May 1951 edition of Poetry magazine was guest-edited by Hart and devoted to the work of the Activist Group, whose approach he defined as follows: \"Each phrase, each unit of poetic notation, was to be written so that it would have esthetic excitement in itself, even detached from the poem.\" Poetry carried a half-issue \"Activist Sequel\" in November 1958, with a further \"Note on the Activists\" by Hart. In the following year, Hart stirred controversy by writing critically of the contemporary San Francisco Renaissance. \n* Lawrence Hart group Circle Editions 1946"

  "text" : "Linda Dement (born 1960 in Brisbane) is an Australian artist working in the fields of photography, film and digital arts as well as writing non-fiction. She began exhibiting in 1984. She graduated with a Bachelor Of Arts (Fine Arts) from City Art Institute, Sydney in 1988. Dement is largely known for her exploration of the creative possibilities of emergent technologies such as the CD-ROM, 3-D modelling, interactive software and early computing. Dement's work has been exhibited in Australia and internationally in galleries and festivals, including at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, Ars Electronica in Austria, the International Symposia of Electronic Art in Sydney and Montreal and the Impakt Media Arts Festival in Europe. Along with Australian artist collective VNS Matrix, Dement's work pioneered Australian cyberfeminism in art. Cyberfeminist politics and poetics used technology to deconstruct gender stereotypes in mainstream culture, and proactively situated women in relation to the rise of electronic culture in the early 1990s. Through her work, Dement aims to \"give form to the unbearable.\" Dement's work has been described as depersonalised autobiography, that is an appropriation of the digital as a space of expression, or a 'rupture' in the info-tech dominated sphere of computer culture. Her work explores the relationship between the physical body and the body politic, exaggerating female 'other-ness' or the \"monstrous-feminine.'"

  "text" : "Li Tai-hsiang (Chinese: 李泰祥; pinyin: Li Taixiang; February 20, 1941 – January 2, 2014) was a Taiwanese Amis composer and folk songwriter. He was best known for penning a series of popular Mandarin-language pop and folk songs throughout the 1960s and 1970s at the height of the genres' popularity. He also composed many classical works. One of his best known songs was the 1979 single, \"The Olive Tree,\" which was performed by his protege, singer Chyi Yu. \"The Olive Tree\", which was based on an English-language poem by Sanmao, was originally written about a small donkey which Sanmao had encountered on a plain in Spain. Li Tai-hsiang had the poem translated to Mandarin by folk singer T.C. Yang, with Sanmao's permission, and wrote the song for Chyi Yu. He omitted with donkey, which he felt would not easily connect with Taiwanese music fans. Chyi Yu has stated in an interview that \"Every time I sing this song [The Olive Tree], I'm nervous.\" Li Tai-hsiang and Chyi Yu also collaborated on a number of her other songs, including \"Daylight Avenue,\" \"Walking in the Rain\" and \"Your Smiling Face.\" Li Tai-hsiang, a member of the Amis indigenous Taiwanese aboriginal community, was born in Taitung, Taiwan, on February 20, 1941. Despite the number of hit songs he had written, he never owned a home and lived in rental properties throughout his life. Li was quoted in a 2004 Taiwanese newspaper interview, \"I'm a musician. My notes are my landscapes. My heart is full of beauty. I don't need a sofa or refined decor to complement it.\" Li suffered from Parkinson's disease for the last 25 years of his life. He died from multiple organ failure at Taipei Tzu Chi General Hospital in Xindian, Taiwan, on January 2, 2014, at the age of 72. His wife had died about five years before his death. He was survived his son and daughter."

They recorded several instrumentals featuring pianist Lovell \"Knot\" Phillips. Renamed as Louis Brooks and his Hi-Toppers, the group began recording for the Excello label in 1954. The following year they had their biggest hit, \"It's Love Baby (24 Hours a Day)\", featuring Earl Gaines. The record entered the R&B chart in July 1955 and reached no.2. The song was also covered successfully by Ruth Brown and Hank Ballard and the Midnighters. Brooks and his band continued to perform regularly in the Nashville area in the 1950s; their vocalists included Larry Birdsong and Helen Hebb, the sister of Bobby Hebb. Brooks also played as a session musician in Nashville, as well as working full-time at the First National Bank in the city. He died in Nashville in 1993, at the age of 82."

  "text" : "Laura Ann Jacobs (born March 1, 1960 in Baltimore) is an American mixed media artist and sculptor. Jacobs is most recognized for her mixed media series that critically addresses issues of gender identity. In her humorous yet complex ensembles, she touches on the inclination of women to succumb to society's dictates and the tragedy hidden behind the \"desire to be desired\". Found objects like smashed glass, broken mirrors or objects from the sea are transformed into sculptures resembling animated foundation garments, corsets, bra's and shoes. Combining both elements of sexuality and comedy, her series provokes questions on the perception and image of women in society. Her work reflects a critical response to how the aesthetics influenced by the modern porn-industry and plastic surgery have created a dual and circus-like image of female bodies and sexuality. Jacobs graduated from San Francisco State University and attended post graduate studies e at the Academy of Art University and California College of Arts and Crafts. She lives and works in San Francisco and Palm Beach, FL."

  "text" : "Lester Gertrude Ellen Rowntree (1879-1979), a renowned field botanist and horticulturalist, was a pioneer in the study, propagation, and conservation of California native plants. In numerous journal and magazine articles, books, and public lectures, she shared her extensive knowledge of wildflowers and shrubs while arguing tirelessly for their protection. A self-proclaimed “lady-gypsy”, Rowntree spent most of each year doing fieldwork in California and the West while living outdoors, believing that the only way to know native plants was to live with them for weeks at a time in their natural surroundings. Because of her reputation as a field botanist, Rowntree has been compared favorably to David Douglas, the 19th century British botanist who first documented western North American flora. Joan Parry Dutton writes: “There are striking similarities between Lester Rowntree and David Douglas. In fact, Lester could be Douglas’ plant-wise and spiritual descendant [for] Lester’s knowledge of California wild flowers is unrivaled; it is safe she knows more about them than Douglas ever knew. \""

Like her father, she is remembered for her act of rebellion against the royal forces, wearing a blue ribbon in her hair, which was the symbol used by the separatist forces, and ultimately cost her her life. Born in Cumaná, she was the daughter of Luis Beltrán de la Guerra, councilman, attorney and trustee. Her mother was Rosa Ramirez Valderrín Antonia. She had at least two brothers, Luis Guerra Ramírez de la Vega, and Vega Ramirez. She married Joseph Tinedo by whom she had a daughter, Francisca Antonia. In 1816, Colonel Juan Aldama vented his anger at Leonor Guerra who had boldly looked out the window while wearing a symbolic blue ribbon. She was cited and threatened with torture. However, she did not abjure her political convictions, nor did she reveal who else supported the independence cause. For her insurgency, she was sentenced to go through the streets, mounted on a donkey, while receiving 200 lashes. Around every corner, she was admonished, and asked to reveal the names of those who thought like her, to which she always replied \"Viva la Patria, death to the tyrants!\" After fainting, she was taken home. Affected by the incident, she refused food and medical care, dying in Cumaná in the same year. A school, Unidad Educativa Leonor de la Guerra, is named in her honor."

  "text" : "Lowell Darling is an American conceptual artist most notable for a series of performances in the 1970s that included nailing cities to the earth, conducting \"urban acupuncture\" by placing oversize needles in the ground, and stitching up the San Andreas Fault. His art includes a run for public office in the 1978 California gubernatorial election, when his primary challenge to Governor Jerry Brown received some 62,000 votes. He is the creator of the \"Fat City School of Finds Art,\" an unaccredited institution that grants free Masters and PhD degrees to arts students. In 2010, 32 years after their last election faceoff, Darling once again challenged Jerry Brown in the race for governor. He has described that 2010 run as a means to raise awareness about California's requirement of a two-thirds majority to pass a budget or tax."

He was the binomial authority of numerous species within the family Cactaceae, of which he published his findings in the Monatsschrift für Kakteenkunde. Plants with the specific epithets of quehlianum and quehlianus are named in his honor; examples being: \n*  Echinocactus quehlianus (F.Haage ex Quehl). \n*  Gymnocalycium quehlianum (F.Haage ex Quehl) Vaupel ex Hosseus).

  "text" : "Lydia \"Lizzie\" Burns (6 August 1827 – 12 September 1878 in London) was a working-class Irish woman, best known as a long-term partner and wife of Friedrich Engels. Lizzie Burns was a daughter of Michael Burns or Byrne, a dyer in a cotton mill, and of Mary Conroy. The family may have lived off Deansgate. Her mother died in 1835, and her father remarried a year later. Lizzie had an elder sister Mary (1821–1863), a lifelong partner of Engels until her sudden death of a heart disease. Mary Burns and Engels considered marriage a bourgeois institution and never married. In the 1850s, when Mary Burns and Engels lived in Ardwick, Lizzie stayed with them as a housekeeper, and after her sister's death eventually became Engels' partner. In the 1870s they lived openly as a couple in London, with Lizzie's niece, Mary Ellen (known as Pumps), as a housekeeper. Both Lizzie and her sister were known as formally illiterate yet intelligent women, with strong working-class ties. They showed Engels the actual conditions of the factory employers in Britain. Eleanor Marx wrote that [Lizzie] was illiterate and could not read or write but she was true, honest and in some ways as fine-souled a woman as you could meet. In early September 1878 Burns fell seriously ill with some kind of tumor, and to please her religious beliefs, Engels married her. She died hours later. Her death made a strong impression on Engels. He later wrote about her: My wife was a real child of the Irish proletariat and her passionate devotion to the class in which she was born was worth much more to me – and helped me more in times of stress – than all the elegance of an educated, artistic middle-class bluestocking."

He also engaged with ordinary residents by responding to inquiries and petitions online. He became Party Secretary of Zunyi in July 2012, which eventually earned him a seat on the provincial party Standing Committee, making Liao one of the province's highest-ranked officials. Liao was abruptly removed from office in October 2013, and was subject to a corruption investigation by the party's internal disciplinary body. Liao was convicted on charges of abuse of power and bribery, and sentenced to 16 years in prison."

  "text" : "Luis Veiga da Cunha was born in Lisbon in 1936. He is a Professor at the Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering of the Nova University of Lisbon. He graduated in Civil Engineering at the Technical University of Lisbon and he holds a PhD degree from the same University. His main professional interests are related to Environment and Natural Resources Policies and Management, with a special emphasis on Water Resources. He worked in Portugal until 1983 in teaching, research and consulting activities. During this period he was involved in numerous research projects and undertook consulting and teaching work in Portugal and in several foreign countries.Between 1971 and 1983 he was Director of the Division of Hydrology and River Hydraulics of the National Laboratory of Civil Engineering, LNEC in Lisbon, where he initiated the development of several new lines of research in the areas of water resources management and planning and of sustainable use of water resources. He was Visiting Professor at Colorado State University (Fort Collins, Colorado) for the full academic year 1975-1976. Between 1983 and 1999 Veiga da Cunha lived in Brussels where he served as Administrator of the Scientific and Environmental Affairs Division of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This Division was the executive arm for the programmes initiated by two Committees of the NATO Council: the Science Committee and the Committee on the Challenges of the Modern Society. The programmes of these two committees were originally intended to foster scientific, technological and environmental cooperation between the North American and the European NATO countries. Later, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, they mainly focused on cooperation between NATO countries and the so-called partner countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Among his responsibilities while serving at NATO, he launched and directed various programs in the area of the environment, in particular the Special Programs on “Environmental Security” and “The Science of Global Environmental Change”. Each of theses areas developed into a large number of projects and about 60 books have been published based on the results. In 1999 Veiga da Cunha returned to Portugal, as a full Professor at the Nova University of Lisbon. He also became a member of the National Council on Environment and Sustainable Development since 2001 and of the National Water Council since its creation in 1994. From 2001 to 2005 he has served as the Portuguese national delegate to the NATO Science Committee. He was a member of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations (1999-2001) and a Lead Author of the chapter on Water Resources of the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC, published in 2001. He was also author and coordinator of the chapter on Water Resources of the Portuguese National Projects SIAM I and SIAM II (Climate Change in Portugal: Scenarios, Impacts and Adaptation Measures, 2001-2006). He was founder and the first President of the Portuguese Water Resources Association (1977–78) and Director of the International Water Resources Association. He was Director of the International Water Resources Association and Chairman of the Committee on River Hydraulics of the International Association on Hydraulic Research. He has been a member of the Editorial Board of Water Policy, the official science and technology journal of the World Water Council. He has also has been a member of the Editorial Board of Water International, the journal of the International Water Resources Association. From 2010 to 2013 he was a member and coordinator of the \"Gulbenkian Think Thank on Water and the Future of Humanity\", an international group of reflection established by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation that gathered eleven distinguished scientists and experts in global water issues. The book \"Water and the Future of Humanity\" (Springer) was published in 2014, as a result of this work. Veiga da Cunha is a member of the Portuguese Academy of Engineering and a member and of the French Water Academy. He is the author of more than one hundred publications, including about 30 books and book chapters on environmental issues and particular on water resources related topics. He was awarded the Portuguese Order of “St. James of the Sword” (Grand-Officer) for scientific and cultural merit, and the French “National Order of Merit” (Grand-Officer). He was Minister of Education of Portugal in 1979-1980."

  "text" : "Lewis Earle Sandt (May 19, 1888 – June 22, 1913) was an American aviation pioneer. Sandt was born in Brookville, Pennsylvania on May 19, 1888. Early in his life, he developed an interest in motorized machines, which led to his opening of a car garage named the Star Garage in Erie, Pennsylvania with his brother, Walter. While in Erie, Earl (who used his middle name) was exposed to aviation exhibitions and had the opportunity to meet Lincoln Beachy, renowned pioneer aviator. With advice from Beachy and others, he decided to learn to fly and attended the Curtiss Flight School in Hammondsport, New York. Earl's career was highlighted by several flight records and a number of accidents. In Erie, Pennsylvania, He had his first accident in his new Curtiss aeroplane on the first day that he experimented with it. Without intending to fly, he lifted from the ground and crash landed, but avoided personal injury. On January 28, 1912, Sandt set an altitude record for Erie of 900 feet. Later, he bested his own record by reaching an altitude of 7,800 feet. His most notable flight was his 34 minute flight across a frozen Lake Erie on February 15, 1912 to Long Point Peninsula near Port Rowan, Canada. Hailed as the first flight across inland seas in America and the first international flight from North America, this flight ended almost in tragedy, as Earl crash landed into the frozen Lake Erie on his return trip. He survived the crash and despite a number of injuries to his eye and body, hiked his way back to shore over and around ice hammocks and thin ice. Despite Sandt's offer of a $300.00 award for the retrieval of his aeroplane, search parties failed to find any remnants of the aeroplane. With the help of Erie newspapers and friends, Sandt managed to acquire a new Curtiss Aeroplane in May 1912. On his first public flight, he flew from Walnut Creek, where he was testing his machine, to Waldameer Park and crashed into a pole rather than hit spectators. Earl's aeroplane was repaired and he resumed flying at his first exhibition outside of Erie in DuBois, Pennsylvania, reaching an altitude of 1800 feet. Sandt's next flight was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where numerous aviators had limited success in previous exhibitions. On June 15, 1912, after taking off from Schenely Park in Oakland, Sandt had a successful flight in Pittsburgh lasting 21 minutes in view of thousands of spectators, many watching from rooftops, over the main parts of the city. After a couple of successful flights at Conneaut Exposition Park, Earl returned to his hometown of Brookville, Pennsylvania. Another mishap occurred when he attempted a flight with his cousin on board. Both survived with slight injuries. Later, Sandt, by himself, flew in what was reported as the first cross country flight in Western Pennsylvania from Brookville, Pennsylvania to Punxsutawney,Pennsylvania, a distance of 22 miles. Returning to Conneaut Exposition Park, Sandt had several more fine exhibition flights until a bad crash resulted in several severe contusions and a concussion. After weeks of convalescing, Earl resumed flying at Fort Recovery, Ohio. Completing the engagement for another pilot, George Schmidt, Earl made the first air mail delivery for the state of Ohio. He then continued with flight exhibitions in Chrisney, Indiana, and Cortland New York. At Cortland, he was presented with a \"Loving Cup\" to award him for his aviation achievements. While in New York and flying from Moravia, he was shot at by a confused farmer. On September 2, 1912, Sandt returned to Pittsburgh, where he flew three days in exhibitions at Brunot's Island. He would finish the exhibition as the only successful flyer. His next flights took him to a number of small towns, Uricheville Ohio, Ripley West Virginia, and Clarion County. At Ripley, he ran his aeroplane into a wire fence, but escaped injury. While being filmed by the Columbia Educational Film Company he crashed into a barb wire fence while flying at an exhibition in Lorain, Ohio, October 6, 1912. Unhurt by his accident, Earl completed engagements at Greenville, Meadville, and Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. In the winter of 1913, Sandt embarked on a series of flights in Erie, Pennsylvania with passengers, including Nellie Seidel, 16 years old, who became the first female to fly in an aeroplane in Erie, Pennsylvania. In the spring of 1913, Earl made experimental trips at Lake Erie to test the hydroaeroplane built by Henry Seidel. This hydroaeroplane was the result of a collaboration between Earl, Seidel,and Earl's brother, Walter. Canceling the testing of the Hydroaeroplane in public during the Memorial Day weekend in 1913, Sandt instead flew in Belleville, Ontario for the King George V birthday celebration and fair, where he became the first to fly over the Bay of Quinte. Sandt's last flight was in Grove City, Pennsylvania. After two trouble free flights, he was having another successful flight before hitting a downdraft which caused the aeroplane to drop suddenly and smash into a garage before landing on freshly cultivated ground. Earl sustained serious injuries, including a compound fracture to his left leg and a fracture to his left arm, as well as many contusions. Despite making good progress in healing from his injuries, Earl developed lock jaw, better known as tetanus. His brother Walter enlisted a special train to bring anti-toxin to Grove City. The anti-toxin brought improvement to Earl at first, but on June 22, 1913, Sandt's symptoms became grave and he died on June 22, 1913 and was buried in Brookville Pennsylvania. In 1930, Mrs. Lindbergh, mother of Charles Lindbergh, who made the first solo flight across the Atlantic, stopped while in Brookville, Pennsylvania to pay tribute to Lewis Earle Sandt for his contributions to the development of early aviation. Other commendations included a \"commemorative air mail envelope\" designed for the first airmail service from Brookville to Pittsburgh. \"In 1957, State Representative Ralph A. Marsh introduced a resolution to the Pennsylvania Assembly, paying tribute to Earle Sandt. It was done on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Charles Lindberg(h)'s flight from New York to Paris, and the 30th anniversary of the United States Air Force. On June 17, 1962, a special DuBois-to-Pittsburgh flight was named after Earle Sandt. Plaques were set up in memory of him at the Greater Pittsburgh International Airport and at the Dubois-Jefferson County Airport\""

She is represented by Matt's Gallery, London. Seers is associated with a genre defined by Mike Brennan as Neo-Narration. Nicolas Bourriaud in his book Altermodern (Tate Triennial 2009) describes her work as ‘ceaselessly re-editing the documentary of her life as a black woman in modern day Britain’, although in fact her works use biography more widely as a locus for a complex intertwining of events."

  "text" : "Lavinia Margaret Engle (May 23, 1892 – May 29, 1979) was an American suffragette and politician. She was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates and Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, leader of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and Maryland League of Women Voters, and held positions within the Social Security Administration. Engle was born in Forest Glen, Maryland, to Quakers James Melvin Engle, a Treasury Department official, and Lavinia Hauke Engle, who was an active suffragette. Lavinia Hauke Engle was the first president of the Montgomery League of Women Voters and a frequent speaker at women's clubs in Maryland. She testified before Congress for women's suffrage with Susan B. Anthony. Lavinia Margaret Engle earned a BA from Antioch College in 1912. She would later return to school as the first female graduate student in political science at The Johns Hopkins University. After completing her BA, she joined the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), where she became a suffrage campaign coordinator. She traveled extensively in the South and was particularly active in organizing the suffrage association in South Carolina. In 1919, she participated in the suffrage march in Washington, D.C. down Pennsylvania Avenue, which was met with violent opposition. After passage of the 19th Amendment, Engle advocated for the continued need for groups advocating women's suffrage rights. After the dissolution of the NAWSA, Engle became a leader of the League of Women Voters. From 1921 to 1936 she served as executive director of the Maryland League of Women Voters. During this time, she pushed for legislation including the Juvenile Court Act, the establishment of a State Department of Infant and Maternal Hygiene, the establishment of the Commission on Almshouses, and the reorganization of the Board of State Aid to Charities. She served on the Commission on Reorganization of the State Administrative Departments in 1921 and the State Commission on Higher Education in 1930. In 1930, she ran for the Maryland House of Delegates from Montgomery County and won a seat. During her one term in office, she helped pass the Marriage Bill and introduced legislation for unemployment insurance. In 1936, she left her post at the Maryland League of Women Voters and was appointed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to the Social Security Administration, where she served until her retirement in 1966. She first acted as an educational representative, traveling the country to speak at college campuses and women's boards, but was soon promoted to Chief of Field Operations. In 1942, she was appointed Director of Region III, and in 1951, she became Assistant to the Commissioner of Social Security in charge of staff development. In 1963, she joined the Welfare Administration."

  "text" : "Leland McPhie (March 10, 1914 – September 3, 2015) was an American centenarian track and field athlete. He has found success in Masters athletics competitions. He also holds the currently ratified M95 American records in the long jump and triple jump. Just four days after his 100th birthday, competing in the USATF Masters Indoor Championships, McPhie was the first centenarian athlete to attempt the high jump, though he failed to clear the bar. McPhie's first experience in the sport of track and field dates to his days at Colton Union High School in Colton, California where he taught himself to pole vault with a bamboo pole. In 1935 he set the school record at San Bernardino Valley College that lasted until the inception of fiberglass vaulting poles that radically changed the event in the 1960s. He continued to San Diego State College where he set the school record in the 220 yard dash and long jump in 1936. To this day, the jump is still ranked #9 in school history, a history that includes two Olympic gold medalists in the long jump, Willie Steele and Arnie Robinson. McPhie joined the Army to fight in World War II, returning to San Diego State to complete his degree. From 1940 to 1969 he worked for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, by 1954 becoming the youngest to attain the rank of captain. During the Vietnam War, he worked for the State Department and picked up the game of tennis. Still decades later he joined a tennis competition at the local Senior Olympics and noticed a track meet going on associated with the event. Since joining in that day, he has won over 200 gold medals and has set numerous American and world records. Widowed in 2000, he survived open heart surgery in 2004 and a couple of forms of cancer. From his recollection, he has three living children, five or six grandchildren and “about 30″ great-grandchildren. He died from a rare form of E. coli bacterial infection."

Lucy Stanton Day's life story is, in countless ways, a testament to the many strong, resilient, and radical women that participated in the first wave of American feminism. Her passionate commitment to abolition especially connected her to her radical female predecessors, such as Angelina E. Grimké, who, as early as 1836, linked the abolition of slavery to the Christian duty of women."

Vincenzinvited women to meet every week at her home during the 1970s to create a safe venue for gay women to discuss gay activism and other lesbian related issues and her home became known as the Gay Women's Open House (GWOH).These meetings became the Gay Women's Alternative. She described her decision in an interview: I decided to have women come into our home every week for seven years, and it just become an establishment. And it was wonderful to have them come, and we had musicians come ... lots of women who didn't know where to go, they didn't want to go to the bars, they just wanted to be in a place that was safe, so we provided that. Her January 1966 photograph taken by Kay Lahusen was the first woman to appear on the cover of lesbian magazine The Ladder with her face showingand she was the only self-identified lesbian to participate in the second White House picket with Frank Kameny. In 2013 her papers, films and other memorabilia were donated to the Library of Congress."

I am certain that the time will come when one will be able to use the elements of a person's life to recreate the physical person. And I am certain that when that time will come, when the liberation of mankind, using all the might of science and technology, the strength and capacity of which we cannot now imagine, will be able to resurrect great historical figures- and I am certain that when that time will come, among the great figures will be our comrade, Lev Iakovlevich.\""

He was born Lee Black Childers in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and started to spell his name with three rather than two \"e\"s as a child. He grew up in Kentucky and attended Kentucky Southern College near Louisville before moving to San Francisco, and, in 1968, to New York City. He started taking photographs of drag queens, and was encouraged by Andy Warhol to work as a photographer, gaining a reputation for his portraits of the artists, musicians and others who passed through the Factory in New York. In the early 1970s, he managed Warhol's stage production, Pork, directed by Tony Ingrassia at the Roundhouse in London. He was assistant to Warhol at the Factory between 1982–84, and took photographs of visiting celebrities, counter-cultural figures and musicians, particularly of punk rock and new wave music stars, such as Debbie Harry, Wayne County and The Sex Pistols. He worked as a tour manager for David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Johnny Thunders and others. In 2012 he published Drag Queens, Rent Boys, Pick Pockets, Junkies, Rockstars and Punks, a collection of some of his photographs and their background which was the subject of an exhibition in London in 2011, and Los Angeles in March 2014. In 2016, Childers 2010 interview was featured in Danny Says appearing alongside Danny Fields, Iggy Pop & Alice Cooper. Childers died in Los Angeles, California on April 6, 2014 at the age of 68 from undisclosed causes."

She was awarded a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Moore College of Art and Design in 1971. In 1990, she married Matthew C. Gruskin. For 30 years, she taught ceramics at the University of the Arts (Philadelphia), before retiring as a professor emeritus in December, 2012. She died June 24, 2013 of lung cancer at her home in Yardley, Pennsylvania. Stewart is best known for her hand-built ceramic portrayals of animals. Typically, the modeling is realistic, but the painting is stylized. Monkey with Roses, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is typical of her larger works and demonstrates this dichotomy, as well as her use of separate ceramic flowers to create an environment. The Hermitage Museum (St. Petersburg, Russia), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington, D.C.), and the Winterthur Museum (Winterthur, Delaware) are among the public collections holding work by Lizbeth Stewart."
