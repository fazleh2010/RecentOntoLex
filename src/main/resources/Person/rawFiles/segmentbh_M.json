This feat, achieved through targeted and sustained online book promotion among fiction bloggers, and the Nigerian online and traditional media, brought her to the attention of literary circles in Nigeria where romance and fiction in general, is not very common. Her books have been described as showing that not only do Nigerians \"fall in love and marry for love, [but] also use love to conquer a wide range of situations that could have ordinarily been a bit difficult to shoulder alone.\""

He was one of four white men who joined the \"Big Six\" to organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. He gave a speech during the march that preceded the \"I Have a Dream\" speech of Martin Luther King, Jr. Following the Civil Rights Movement, he directed several civil rights and Catholic service initiatives.

  "text" : "Maurice Hume Black (15 December 1835 – 16 August 1899) was an Australian politician, member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Black was a grand-nephew of the celebrated Joseph Hume, Member for Montrose in the British House of Commons. He was born in London, England and in 1861 married Maria Frederica Davies, a niece of the great statesman, George Canning. Having emigrated to Victoria (Australia) in 1852, Black left the goldfields of that colony to try his luck in pastoral pursuits in South Australia, subsequently going to the Riverina, and in 1864 to Queensland. Black was the inventor of a steam sheep-washing process, and went into sugar planting in the Mackay district of Queensland in 1871. In 1881 Black was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the seat of Mackay. Having taken a prominent part in the agitation for the separation of Northern Queensland from the rest of the colony, and its formation into a distinct colony, he was in 1887 commissioned to go to England with Mr. Lissner to press the matter upon the attention of the Home Government, Harold Finch-Hatton and Dr. Ahearne having done much to bring the matter into the region of practical politics by their exertions during the previous year. Though not successful in inducing Lord Knutsford to take steps for the separation of Northern Queensland, the advanced phase which the question has since assumed is a good deal due to the efforts of the delegation of 1887. In June 1888, on the formation of the second Thomas McIlwraith Administration, Black became Secretary of Public Works, and continued to hold the post when five months later the Ministry was reconstructed under Boyd Dunlop Morehead. Black resigned with his colleagues in August 1890. Black left Parliament in April 1893 and worked as an immigration agent in the agent-general's office in London; this post was abolished in 1894. Then Black decided to try his luck on the Coolgardie, Western Australia goldfields with some of his family; he arrived in 1896 and set up as an attorney for mining companies. Black died in Coolgardie on 16 August 1899 of cirrhosis of the liver and cardiac failure and was buried in the Coolgardie Cemetery. His wife returned to Queensland and died in 1906."

He is also Honorary Professor in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Birmingham. In a trio of books published between 1965 and 1970 Kaser presented a detailed picture of the workings of the socialist planned economies at enterprise, national and international levels. His work has sought to apply Keynesian economic theory to the analysis of the socialist planned economies and he identified the systemic problems that were neglected by the ruling communist parties, and which contributed to the disintegration of the economic system at the end of the 1980s."

During the following year, he performed similar roles as part of the Créqui Montfort et Sénéchal de la Grange mission in South America. From 1904 to 1920, he was an associate professor to the faculty of medicine in Lyon, where for a number of years he gave lectures on parasitology. Afterwards, he was appointed chef des travaux de parasitologie to the faculty of medicine in Paris, and in 1926 he became a professor in the school of malariology at the university. During the 1920s, he conducted several scientific expeditions to the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa. In 1901 he described a family of parasitic protists known as Haemogregarinidae. In 1924 he named several genera of parasites that affected large mammals (Khalilia, Paraquilonia, Buissonia, Henryella)."

In 1965, Mike McNulty died at Studio City Convalescent Hospital in Studio City, California at the age of 78. \"Modern fighters don't know what road work is. Their idea now is 10 or 15 minutes. Phooey! Why I remember when old timers like Tommy Gibbons, Mike O'Dowd and Billy Miske used to run for hours in any kind of weather to strengthen their underpinning and lungs. They would get up early in the morning and ride the street car as far out of St. Paul as they could and then they'd run every step of the way back to the gym. And listen cold weather never bothered those men. On the zero days they'd put on enough clothes to sag these modern fighters to the ground and lug that extra weigh all the way home. Those men were great fighters and were always in condition and long lived in the game. Being in condition and staying that way means everything. These present day boxers - phooey.\"- Mike McNulty on July 30, 1935"

  "text" : "Michael O'Sullivan (born 5 April 1962) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Melbourne and Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL). O'Sullivan, a left-footer, was originally from Seymour and went to Assumption College. He was a member of Melbourne's Under 19s premiership winning team in 1981. He had a strong first season with Melbourne, in 1982, when he played in all 22 rounds and amassed 314 kicks, the second most at the club behind Adrian Battiston, the only other player not to miss a game that year. In the opening round of the 1983 season, against Collingwood, O'Sullivan badly injured his shoulder. A staple that had been inserted into his shoulder during his Under 19s career had broken and as a result he missed the rest of the season. O'Sullivan was unlucky again in 1984, missing the second half of the season after breaking his jaw in Melbourne's round 10 win over Richmond. He played 18 games in 1985, but only five in 1986 and didn't play senior football in 1987. His only appearance for Essendon came in round 19, 1988, against Geelong. O'Sullivan coached Seymour in the 1992 Goulburn Valley Football League season."

  "text" : "Maurice Armand Chaper (13 February 1834, Dijon – 5 July 1896, Vienna) was a French geologist and mining engineer. He received his education at the École Polytechnique and École des Mines, afterwards working at jobs for the railroads and public works. He enlisted in the National Guard during the Franco-Prussian War, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the 38th Regiment. In 1872 he was named assistant mayor of the 5th arrondissement of Paris. As a member of the Société géologique de France, he began, from 1874, a number of geological and mineralogical missions to all parts of the globe — Venezuela, the Rocky Mountains, Borneo, southern Africa, the Urals, et al. As part of a geological survey in Central America, he was involved with the Compagnie du canal de Panama. In addition to mineralogical collections, he collected zoological and botanical specimens. The species, Millettia chaperii, was named in his honor by botanist François Gagnepain, it being based on Chaper's collection from Borneo. In 1884 he was selected as president of the Société zoologique de France."

He was born Anthony Lee to Philomena Lee in Ireland, and spent his first years of life in a convent before being adopted by Marge and Doc Hess of St. Louis, Missouri. The issues surrounding his adoption are controversial, as part of a program of forced adoptions practiced by some Catholic religious orders in Ireland at the time, and the story of that early part of his life was later told in British journalist Martin Sixsmith's book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee and in the film Philomena."

Arditi was appointed as Director of the Royal Museum and Superintendent of Excavations, and was charged with the task of developing a new integrated plan for the development of the excavations in the Kingdom. This meant reviving the work at Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Paestum, as well as bringing into focus work at the sites north of Naples, for example at Pozzuoli and the area around Cuma."

  "text" : "Margaretha von Waldeck (1533 – 15 March 1554) was the daughter of Philip IV of Waldeck-Wildungen (1493–1574) and his first wife, Margaret of East Frisia (1500–1537). She is believed to be an influence for the fairy tale of Snow White. Margaretha's father owned several copper mines - a majority of workers were children. When Margaretha was about 16 or 17, she left her home because she and her new step-mother could not get along. She settled in Brussels and soon attracted the attention of the future Philip II of Spain. They became lovers with the intention to marry; however, the union was forbidden by Phillip's father (who saw no political value) and Margaretha's step-mother (who simply hated the girl). Unlike the fairy tale, this story does not have a happy ending: be it fate or foul play, Margaretha was dead by the age of 21. It is believed that she was poisoned: the handwriting in her last will and testament was shaky enough to make most people think she had developed tremors, a sign of poisoning. However, no one knows what exactly killed Margaretha, though we can rule out one suspect: her stepmother was already dead. Another of her suitors was Lamoral, Count of Egmont. Eckhard Sander, in his book Schneewittchen: Märchen oder Wahrheit? (Snow White: Is It a Fairy Tale?), alleges that Margaretha is inspiration for the tale of Snow White."

  "text" : "Max Dauphin was born in Luxembourg in 1977. After several years of international activity, the artist settled in Luxembourg where he works and lives. he is part of the Bamhaus Art Collective. Max Dauphin creates figurative art works, using mixed techniques and big formats. His paintings frequently reveal scenes of life illustrated with slogans and/or iconography. His subjects are inspired by his experience, current events and more generally his entourage. Following daily conversations, the artist projects the viewer's attention toward captivating characters, sometimes living on the brink of society. By matching these characters with improbable attributes, their apparent realism gives way to the imagination. During his periples, Max Dauphin works with a deliberate challenge: to use a local palette of available materials. The combination of colors and material highlights the playfulness of his characters and emphasizes the dynamism of his subjects. Like most children, his first contact with art took place while drawing with his father, a graphic designer, at the kitchen table. In the absence of his father, he continued to paint - a conversation prolonged throughout his career. During his studies in Marseille, France, Max Dauphin made contact with graffiti artists and dedicated himself to street art for a while. In parallel to his urban art-treks, he started showing his first paintings at the age of twenty-five. In 2005, Max Dauphin participated in a group exhibition with an art work entitled Dongo the Vulture illustrating West African poetry at the French cultural center in Rome, Italy. The same year, he also exhibited a series of portraits at the Luxembourg Embassy in Italy. In 2007, Max Dauphin opened a joint exhibition entitled Brush vs. Spray Can with graffiti artist Sumo at Konschthaus Beim Engel in Luxembourg. Max Dauphin's first solo show No Names was shown in Kulturfoyer, Saarbruecken, Germany in 2009. That year, the international competition Francophone games in Beirut, Lebanon, rewarded his painting Medusa's Raft with a special mention from the Jury. While living in Central Asia, the artist exhibited City Spirits at the Tsagaandarium Gallery in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. During his time in New York (2011-2013) Max Dauphin came up with an American collection. Original is not even a Flavor successfully premiered at Rockaway Beach Surf Club and was later shown on Lower East Side at ConArtist Gallery. From 2014-2015 Max Dauphin worked in Dakar, Senegal, where he showed an African series of paintings Ana Wa Kër Gui?"

These are recognized by mainstream Shiites as misguided groups. In fact, these were the ones meant by the MUI fatwa earlier about Shia. There is something needs to be well recognized by Shiites that Ahlu Sunnah has a firm stance about Shahabah.

  "text" : "Mary Anna Sibell Elizabeth Marten, OBE (1929 – 2010) was born Mary Anna Sibell Elizabeth Sturt on 12 September 1929 at Moor Critchel, the daughter of Napier Sturt, 3rd Baron Alington and Lady Mary Sibell Ashley-Cooper, daughter of the 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, sometime Lord Steward to the Household of George V & Queen Mary, by his wife Lady Constance Sibell Grosvenor (d 1957), a great friend of Queen Mary, dau of Earl Grosvenor, and sister of Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster. She was god-daughter to Queen Elizabeth (later The Queen Mother), and in 1953 her son Napier was a page at the Coronation of Elizabeth II. After joining the Brownies alongside Princess Margaret, Mary Anna went to school in Lancaster Gate and later attended Cheltenham Ladies' College.Upon the death of her father, Baron Alington in active service in the RAF in 1940, Mary Anna inherited the Crichel House Estate in Dorset. Part of the Estate had been compulsorily purchased by the Government in 1938, and the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill later gave an undertaking that when the Government no longer needed the land for the purpose for which it had been requisitioned, the land would be sold back to the original owners. When this did not happen, Mary Anna and her husband took on the Government, and eventually won back their land, following the resignation over the issue by the relevant Minister. The episode became known as The Crichel Down affair, a term still used in British legislation. The estate was sold after her death.Mary Anna and her husband, Lt.-Cdr. George (Toby) Gosselin Marten, L.V.O. D.S.C., Royal Navy, (1918 - 1997), son of Vice-Admiral Sir Francis Arthur Marten, K.B.E., C.B., C.M.G., C.V.O., were married on 25 November 1949 at Holy Trinity Brompton. He was an equerry to George VI, and the marriage was attended by George VI, Queen Elizabeth (Mary Anna's godmother), Princess Margaret, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duchess of Kent, the Earl and Countess of Athlone. The Martens had a son, Napier, and five daughters.Mary Anna was High Sheriff of Dorset from 1989 to 1990. She was an archaeologist of note. In 1956, her brother-in-law, Tim Marten, was Head of the Chancery in the Embassy of the United Kingdom, Tehran. During a visit to him, Mary Anna became deeply attached to Iran, which she explored over many subsequent visits, often staying with the archaeologist Roman Ghirshman at his excavations at Choga Zanbil. In 1988, Mary Anna established The Ancient Persia Fund in memory of the distinguished Russian scholar Vladimir G Lukonin. The aim of the fund was and is to encourage and support the study of Ancient Persia and related areas including Central Asia, in the period before the coming of Islam. Mary Anna was appointed a Trustee of the British Museum by the Prime Minister on 5 December 1985. She was reappointed twice (5 December 1990 and 5 December 1995). She retired on the 4 December 1998. She served on the following committees of the British Museum: \n*  Buildings (where she occupied the Chair); \n*  External Relations and Public Services; \n*  2003 and \n*  Great Court Client. Mary Anna was acting chair of the British Museum Society from 15 December 1990 to 29 February 1992 and she was also on the British Museum Development Trust [BMDT] Board of Trustees. She was also the Trustees' representative on the Council of the National Trust between 16 December 1993 and 31 December 1996. In 2002 she presented one of twelve eagle brooches worn by Queen Victoria's bridesmaids to the British Museum to mark the retirement of the Director, R. D. Anderson. Mary Anna was also a Trustee of the Charles Sturt Museum. She was created an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE). Mary Anna was also a collector of Chinese works of art, many inherited.She was a collector of jade and of rare booksIn 2008 Mary Anna published (privately) her memoirs entitled 'As it Was'. Mary Anna died on 20 January 2010. The funeral was held at St. Giles's Church, Wimborne St. Giles, Dorset, on 29 January 2010. She was buried with her husband in Witchampton Churchyard, Dorset; the grave is to the north east of the church."

  "text" : "Mary Aloysia Molloy (June 14, 1880 – September 27, 1954) was President of the College of Saint Teresa from 1928 through 1946. Molloy was born in Sandusky, Ohio, the only child of Irish immigrants. She attended Sandusky High School where she won an essay contest by the Ohio Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. She gained admittance to Ohio State University in 1899 and earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1903, with more honors than anyone else up to that time. Molloy won a fellowship to attend graduate school at Ohio State and completed her master's in English philology in 1905. She continued her studies at Cornell University where she completed her doctorate in 1907. Her doctoral thesis, \"The Vocabulary of the Old English Bede\", was a concordance to the Anglo-Saxon translation of Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. Following her graduation, in August 1907 Molloy responded to an advertisement seeking a Catholic woman professor in Winona, Minnesota. Working under Sister Leo Tracy, O.S.F., of the Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, Minnesota, she taught the freshman curriculum at Winona Seminary. In 1908 she was named the Seminary's assistant principal and began teaching second year courses. The Seminary became the College of Saint Teresa and Molloy was atypical as the lay dean of a Catholic college. Molloy delivered remarks at the 1917 convention of the National Catholic Education Association (NCEA) on improving women's education. She voiced her concerns over the future of Catholic colleges at the 1918 convention, criticizing the quality of education. She called for fewer institutions that provided stronger curriculum that included medical and legal training. Bishop Patrick R. Heffron of Winona promoted her cause in Rome and Pope Benedict XV awarded Molloy the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal for her service in women's higher education. It was the first time such an honor was bestowed on an American woman for education. In 1923 she became the first woman to be appointed to the NCEA's College and University Department executive committee. In 1923 she also became a Franciscan Sister, then known as Sister Mary Aloysius Molloy, O.S.F., and in 1928 became the college's president. As an educator, Molloy worked hard to improve the quality of women's education, wrestled with problems particular to Catholic colleges, and carefully oversaw the development of her own school. By 1946, when Molloy retired, the College of Saint Teresa was an established institution producing graduate women. Molloy died at age 74."

A Willaura recruit, Dreher played for Collingwood from 1979 to 1982. Three of Dreher's his first four appearances with Collingwood came in the 1979 finals series. After debuting in round 20, Dreher played in a qualifying final, semi final and preliminary final. Collingwood won the preliminary final, over North Melbourne, but Dreher lost his place for the grand final to Stan Magro, who was returning from suspension. Dreher played just two games in 1980, when he was troubled by a back injury. During the 1981 VFL season Dreher was almost part of the trade that saw Warwick Irwin go from Fitzroy to Collingwood. Dreher and teammate Des Herbert, along with over $60,000, were to be given to Collingwood, but he was replaced in the deal by Leigh Carlson. Against Carlton at Victoria Park in the third round of the 1982, Dreher broke a bone in his neck and although he played out the game he was out of the side with the injury until round 15. His last appearance for Collingwood was their round 20 loss to Melbourne, his seventh game of the season. He went to West Adelaide in 1983 and was a centre half-back in their premiership team that year."

  "text" : "Mark Phineas Chamberlain is an American photographic/environmental/installation artist, gallery owner and curator. He was born and raised in Dubuque, Iowa (See List of people from Dubuque, Iowa), received his BA in Political Science in 1965, and Masters in Operations Research in 1967, from the University of Iowa. Chamberlain was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1967 and stationed in Korea during the American War in Vietnam. On discharge from the army, he changed his previous career course to become a photographic artist. He explains, \"While stationed overseas, I picked up a camera to maintain my sanity and provide a creative outlet. I also took classes in the Korean language and history and found a photography mentor in the military crafts program. Returning home, I had a growing desire to find an outlet for this newfound passion.\" In 1969, Chamberlain moved to Southern California, aspiring to open a photographic art gallery. Mark Chamberlain co-founded BC Space Gallery and Photographic Art Services, Laguna Beach in 1973 with Jerry Burchfield (now deceased), and has operated the space solely since 1987. The venue, perhaps one of the longest continually running fine art photography galleries in the country, also hosts community, political and solstice events, theatrical and musical performances. With BC as a base of operations, Chamberlain and Burchfield co-founded “Laguna Canyon Project: The Continuous Document” (1980-2010) to record changes to Laguna Canyon over time. A crucial phase of this project was The Tell photographic mural, which in 1989 became the site of an enormous Demonstration that helped avert development of the area into a massive housing community. That site is today incorporated into Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. In 2002, the art partners co-founded \"The Legacy Project,\" which has been documenting the transition of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro into the Orange County Great Park. \"The Legacy Project\" members, ultimately numbering six, created The Great Picture, one of the largest photographs in the world made as a single seamless image. On October 22, 2014, Mark Chamberlain received a Helena Modjeska Cultural Legacy Award as “Artistic Visionary” from Arts Orange County. The award was presented at the Samueli Theater, Segerstrom Center for the Arts, Costa Mesa, CA."

Born in Germany following World War II to Americans stationed in a refugee camp, O'Connor began his career as a journalist in the 1980s. As a foreign journalist, he covered civil wars and conflicts for NPR, The New York Times, CBS News, among others. In 2009, he started his work at CPJ as a representative of Mexico, one of the most dangerous countries for journalists in the world. He travelled across the country investigating attacks against the press and cases about intimidation, disappearances, and murder of Mexican journalists. In 2012, he was one of the leading figures behind the promotion of a federal law signed by former President Felipe Calderón that gave the federal government more jurisdiction to investigate crimes against the press, cases traditionally reserved for local and state officials."

His only other senior appearance was against Collingwood the following year, in round 15. He was the reserves best and fairest winner again in 1985. Both of the years he played senior football were premiership years for Essendon. In 1986 he returned to Coburg for one season, then made his way to West Adelaide in 1987."

Thirty-four inches long (86 cm), her blonde hair had never been chemically treated or heated with curling irons, and therefore proved resilient enough to use as crosshairs in Norden bombsights for bomber aircraft, which have to withstand a wide range of temperatures and humidity. Brown was never compensated for her donation; she was offered war savings stamps, but turned them down, believing what she had done was her patriotic duty. She was told at the time only that the hair was needed for meteorological instruments, and had no idea how it had been used until 1987. President Ronald Reagan wrote to her that year on her 80th birthday to thank her, and in 1991 she received a special achievement award from the Colorado Aviation Historical Society during a ceremony at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs."

She is one of Japan's best female athletes in the horizontal jumps: she holds the Japanese records for the triple jump outdoors with 14.04 m (46 ft 0 3⁄4 in) and is also the record holder in both the long and triple jump indoors. Her long jump best of 6.82 m (22 ft 4 1⁄2 in) is a former Japanese record, second to Kumiko Ikeda. Her greatest international performance was a long jump gold medal at the 2006 Asian Indoor Athletics Championships, where she set a championship record. She was the long jump runner-up at the 2002 Asian Games and a three-time bronze medallist at the Asian Athletics Championships. She won medal in both jumps at the 2001 East Asian Games. At the global level Hanaoka represented Japan at the 2004 Olympic Games, the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, twice at the IAAF World Indoor Championships (1999 and 2006), and twice at the Summer Universiade (1995 and 1999). At national level she was a five-time Japanese long jump champion and won five triple jump national titles. In her career she won seven times in the jumps at the National Sports Festival of Japan."

  "text" : "Marie Jansen (November 18, 1857 – March 20, 1914) was an American musical theatre actress best known for her roles at the end of the 19th century. She starred in a number of successful comic operas, Edwardian musical comedies, and comic plays in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and London during the 1880s and 1890s. After gaining notice for her role in the American production of Olivette (1880), she became known for her performances in the title role of the original American production of Iolanthe (1882), in the long-running comic opera Erminie (1886), the title roles in Featherbrain (1884) and Nadjy (1888), and her role in The Oolah (1889). Later in her career, she performed in vaudeville and formed her own touring theatre company. Jansen ran into financial difficulties, by the late 1890s, partly due to losses as a producer, that left her in reduced circumstances for the remainder of her life."

  "text" : "Mangku Muriati (born in 1967) is a traditional-style Balinese painter and priestess from Kamasan village near Klungkung, Bali, Indonesia. Mangku Muriati, born in 1967, paints in traditional Balinese form, known as Kamasan-style, where the aesthetic form and most stories relate to the wayang kulit puppet theatre. This form of painting has a very old tradition, associated with the East Javanese kingdom of Majapahit, which flourished in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and helped to propagate Hindu faith across the region – now largely retained in Bali. It was from the Kamasan village where artists were traditionally recruited to produce classical-style paintings on cloth (or bark cloth) for religious and ceremonial use as well as to decorate the palaces and temples. Mangku Muriati is a daughter of Mangku Mura (1920-1999), who is considered one of the prominent artists of his generation in Kamasan-style painting [1]. As was common practice in artist families, Muriati used to help her father in colouring paintings from an early age, learning the craft of painting. She studied art at the Udayana University in Denpasar, Bali, but after graduating, returned to the traditional style of painting. Working as a Kamasan artist, she joined a small number of Balinese women who work in this style, customarily dominated by men. In the 1990s, at the age of 32, Muriati became a priestess at her local clan temple in the ward of Banjar Siku. She considers painting and priestly duties as complementary, comparing the role of an artist to a dhalang or puppeteer, who needs an extensive knowledge of characters and stories, ultimately derived from what is considered the sacred scripture - the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. The subjects of her paintings and related commentaries frequently refer to social and political issues in contemporary Bali. [3] Muriati’s paintings have been exhibited in Bali as well as internationally."

Kemble was born in Sligo, Ireland, but was taken in early life to Australia, where she was educated at the Geelong Convent School in Victoria (Australia) so that she generally ranked among Australian-born artists, among whom she was one of the most popular and capable. For some years she held the place of \"leading lady\" in various companies, and has been equally a favourite in all the cities of Australia and New Zealand. In 1890 Miss Kemble paid her first visit to England, when she purchased the colonial \"rights\" of Dr. Bill, by Charles Hamilton Aide, and other pieces. During her sojourn in London, Mr. Robert Buchanan wrote the play Man and the Woman especially for the popular colonial actress, who produced it at a matinée at the Criterion, where, however, despite excellent acting, it did not prove successful. After Miss Kemble's return to Sydney she made a brilliant reappearance at the Criterion Theatre in that city in Dr. Bill, and she toured the various colonies. Kemble died in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, on 27 October 1906."

  "text" : "Priest Martinac (Croatian: pop Martinac) was a 15th-century Croatian Glagolite scribe, calligrapher and illuminator. In 1484–1494 in Grobnik he copied the Drugi novljanski brevijar (\"The Second Novi Vinodolski Breviary\") for the Pauline monastery in Novi Vinodolski, a Glagolitic codex in 500 folios. Column gaps were filled with his writings. The most famous is the one from 1493 – Zapis popa Martinca (\"The Record of Father Martinac\") in which he describes the difficult situation in Croatia after the defeat of the Croatian nobility at the Battle of Krbava Field. That record is attested in folios 267 a–d and is written in a mixture of a Croatian vernacular and Church Slavonic. It is inspired by the biblical Book of Judith and describes the atrocities of Ottoman Turks as they as \"flocked unto the people of Croatia\" (nalegoše na ezikь hrvatski). Martinac's account of the battle is generally recognized as the beginnings of Croatian patriotic poetry."

Mufarrij was engaged in repeated rebellions against the Fatimid Caliphate, which controlled southern Syria at the time. Although he was several times defeated and forced into exile, by the 990s Mufarrij managed to establish himself and his tribe as the de facto autonomous masters of much of Palestine around Ramlah (the district of Jund Filastin) with Fatimid acquiescence. In 1011, another rebellion against Fatimid authority was more successful, and a short-lived Jarrahid-led Bedouin state was established in Palestine centred at Ramlah. The Bedouin even proclaimed a rival Caliph to the Fatimid al-Hakim, in the person of the Alid Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far. Bedouin independence survived until 1013, when the Fatimids launched their counterattack. Their will to resist weakened by Fatimid bribes, the Bedouin were quickly defeated. At the same time Mufarrij died, possibly poisoned, and his sons quickly came to terms with the Fatimids. Among them, Hassan ibn Mufarrij al-Jarrah managed to succeed to his father's position, and became a major player in the politics of the region over the next decades."

  "text" : "Menachem (Max) Stark (July 15, 1974 – January 3, 2014) was an American real estate developer based in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. A prominent member of Brooklyn's Hasidic community, Stark was kidnapped outside his office at 331 Rutledge Street in Brooklyn on January 2, 2014, in an intended robbery. His body was found smoldering in a dumpster outside a Getty station on Cutter Mill Road in Great Neck, New York, on January 3, 2014. According to coroner reports, he died of suffocation, and was also badly burned on his torso and hands. When found, he had $4,000 cash in his pocket, and uncashed checks in his name worth another $41,000. Stark exited his office at around 11:45pm on January 2, 2014, into a heavy blizzard. A surveillance camera positioned near the office captured images of Stark struggling with two attackers for nearly five minutes, before being forced into a silver Dodge Caravan. Broken handcuffs and plastic restraining tape were later found on the sidewalk. During the weeks before his death, Stark reportedly ended his conversations with the phrase \"Please pray for me\", and asked the person to whom he was speaking to invoke his name and his mother's name, a sign in Orthodox Judaism of someone facing a life-threatening situation."

Moin saab didn't promote only cricket or football but tennis, squash, badminton also. \"He was immensely impressed with the strong nation character of the British people and their resilience,\" says author and retired IPS officer, Sudhir Kumar Jha in his book Patna Reincarnated: A New Dawn. \"Moin saab was like the guardian of sports culture in Patna. He feverishly promoted all kinds of sports among students, first in colleges and later in universities and urged them to take part in sporting competitions. In fact, the sports quota in educational intuitions in Bihar owes its genesis through his efforts only,\" saidShabab Anwar, veteran sports journalist and commentator based in Patna, who has written on Moin-ul-Haq's life and legacy. Scholar Sujit Mukherjee, who also played a bit of first-class cricket, spoke highly of Haq in his book Autobiography of an Unknown Cricketer: \"... the nearly immortal Principal Moin-ul Haq, holder of the highest offices in various national bodies, saw to it that any talent in any game was given whatever support or encouragement that Patna had to offer,\" the book says."

He founded the Watami chain of izakaya restaurants and headed the company until 2011, when he resigned to run in the Tokyo gubernatorial election, 2011. Watanabe's run for the governorship of Tokyo was inspired by Michael Bloomberg's mayorship of New York City. Watanabe came in third with 16.8%, losing to incumbent governor Shintaro Ishihara. He was elected to the House of Councillors representing the Liberal Democratic Party in the 2013 election. As of January 2014, he was the wealthiest member of the House of Councillors with reported personal assets of 1.76 billion yen. He is a member of the Committee on Economy and Industry, Committee on Oversight of Administration, Special Committee on Reconstruction after the Great East Japan Earthquake, and Research Committee on Deflation-Ending Measures and Strengthening Public Finance for Nationals' Life. The Watami group has faced criticism as a \"black company\" for its harsh treatment of employees, and was voted the worst company in Japan to work for in 2012 and 2013. The 2008 suicide of Mina Mori, a Watami employee who had worked 140 hours of overtime was ruled a case of karōshi (death from overwork) by the Kanagawa Prefecture Labor Standards Office, who also accused the company of numerous labor law violations. In December 2015 Watami reached an out-of-court settlement of 130 million yen with the family and Watanabe apologised. Watanabe founded the School Aid Japan charity in 2001 to build schools and orphanages in Cambodia and Nepal."

His other screenwriting credits include Trois pommes à côté du sommeil and Cargo. As a director, he made the short films Sortie 234, La nuit du visiteur and Lettre à mon père before releasing his feature debut, Cap Tourmente, in 1993. Following Cap Tourmente, however, Langlois has concentrated exclusively on documentary films. His first documentary, released in 2002, was Le fil cassé, an exploration of his own family genealogy. The film, whose title translates as The Broken Thread, was inspired by the fact that as a gay man he would not be fathering children, and thus documenting his ancestry would be his primary contribution to the family history. He followed up with Mère et monde, a documentary about the family whose small inn in Saint-Joseph-de-la-Rive had inspired Cap Tourmente, in 2009; and Anne des vingt jours, a biographical documentary about writer Anne Hébert, in 2013."

From 1904 to 1914, she curated the Maria Mitchell memorial located on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. Her work there covered both the nascent botany department and the astronomical observatory. In the botany department, she curated an herbarium of Nantucket plants, in memorial of her cousin Mitchell's love of flowers. She died in 1914 on Nantucket Island. Mrs. Albertson's daughter Alice Owen Albertson was the author of the book 'Nantucket Wildflowers' (G. P. Putnam's sons,1921)."

  "text" : "Michael Lavalette (born 1962) is a member of the Socialist Workers Party and former local councillor in Preston, Lancashire, England. He was first elected as a Socialist Alliance candidate shortly after the Iraq War began in 2003. In 2007, he was re-elected, this time standing for the Respect Party. In the Respect split in 2007 he remained loyal to the SWP and broke with George Galloway. Re-elected in 2012 as an Independent Socialist, he was affiliated with TUSC until he retired from his seat in 2015. He is an Associate Professor of Social Work at Liverpool Hope University, formerly having worked at both Liverpool and Central Lancashire universities. Along with Chris Jones, Iain Feguson, and Laura Penketh, he was an author of the Social Work manifesto for a new engaged practice and organiser of the Liverpool and Glasgow conferences of the Social Work Action Network (SWAN), which stands in the radical social work tradition and seeks to oppose the increased managerialism and privatisation within the social work profession, and to promote social work practice based on principles of social justice. At the end of 2008 the Social Work Action Network ran a campaign defending social workers in the aftermath of the Baby P tragedy. Shortly after, along with Iain Ferguson, he wrote a polemical pamphlet called 'Social Work After Baby P' that included significant contributions from academics, practitioners and senior trade union officers. Lavalette originally joined his local Labour Party in North Ayrshire at the age of 16 in 1979, but by January 1981 he had left to join the SWP. In the early 1990s he moved to Preston for work and became politically active in the local labour movement. In Preston he continues to be politically active. He is the co-ordinator of the local Stop the War Coalition. He organised a solidarity day in Preston for victims of the Asian Tsunami and has led campaigns against hospital privatisation, Islamophobia, the wars in the Middle East and support for local trade unionists on strike. In May 2007 he was re-elected to Preston council and held his seat until May 2011, when he lost it to Labour. In December 2010 Michael Lavalette proposed a motion to Preston City Council calling for opposition to cuts, job losses and privatisations. This motion had the backing of the local trades council and of 'Preston Against Cuts'. 5 Labour councillors had voted and spoken in favour of this motion at these meetings. When it came to the full council meeting however, all the Labour councillors voted against this motion, and for an amendment supporting 'fairer' cuts backed by the Liberals and Tories. In May 2012 he contested the seat again as a Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition supported candidate and was re-elected. Lavalette regularly contributes to the Lancashire Evening Post."

  "text" : "Maxwell Miller (1832 – 10 April 1867) was a journalist and politician in colonial Tasmania. Miller was born in London, England, the third son of Robert Miller, a barrister, and his wife Jane Matilde, née Montmorini. He was educated at St. Paul's School, whence he went up with a scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford. Here he gained the Fitzgerald scholarship, which transferred him to Queen's College. In 1852, at the instance of his elder brother William, who had emigrated to Victoria, he sailed for Melbourne. Soon after Miller's arrival in Melbourne, Dr. Charles Perry, the then Anglican Bishop of Melbourne, offered him the appointment of Secretary to the Diocese. This office he held until he obtained one of the two Inspectorships of Education for Victoria, the other Inspector being Hugh Childers. He resigned this office to become one of the sub-editors of the Argus newspaper, and shortly after his brother William and he received an invitation to conduct a newspaper in Hobart, which was being started in the Liberal interest. The Tasmanian Daily News was the result, a paper which, though creditable for its literary matter and effective as a political weapon, ended in heavy pecuniary loss after two or three years' existence. On the introduction of responsible government in 1856, Mr. Miller was returned to the Tasmanian House of Assembly as a member for Hobart Town, and soon made his mark as a debater. In conjunction with Mr. (later Sir F.) Smith, he introduced the scheme of Superior Education and endowed Tasmanian scholarships, which remained in force in the colony for some twenty-five years until the recent establishment of the Tasmanian University. Mr. Miller held office without portfolio in the short-lived ministry of Thomas Gregson, from 26 February to April 1857. In 1863 Mr. Miller resigned his seat, and accepted the appointment of assistant-clerk to the House, an office which he held until within a short time of his death, which took place at Hobart on 10 April 1867. Miller was a brother of Robert Byron Miller. He was the author of The Tasmanian House of Assembly: A Metrical Catalogue (Hobart, 1860), a trenchant political satire."

He then moved to theatre and wrote three plays. In 1994, at the age of 23, he traveled to Mexico and made it his adoptive home. In 1998, while in Mexico, he began a career as a journalist while studying screenwriting at a Vincente Leñero workshop. In 2005, one of his first scripts, Naturalezas muertas won at the Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografía. In 2006, he directed his first short film, Cacahuates. Silencio followed in 2007. Though English is his native language, the bulk of his film work is done in Spanish. In 2010, Rowe directed Año bisiesto (Leap Year), which garnered him the Caméra d'Or prize for best first time feature film director at the Cannes Film Festival. The film was well received by critics. His follow-up film, The Well (Manto acuífero) premiered at the Rome Film Festival in 2013. In 2013, it was announced that Rowe is working on his English feature debut slated for production in Montreal. The film is a co-production between a Quebec production house  Possibles Media  (run by  (fr) Serge Noël) and Australia's Freshwater Pictures (run by Trish Lake) and stars Suzanne Clément. The film will have a first cut shown in Melbourne film festival and some reviews there, but it will have the official international premiere of the director's cut at the  Venice Mostra where it will win the  Venice Days Award for 2015."

  "text" : "Mark J. Nigrini, born in Cape Town, South Africa, is a faculty member at the College of Business and Economics at West Virginia University in Morgantown in the US state of West Virginia. Nigrini is best known for his work on using Benford's Law as an auditing and accounting tool to detect anomalies in company data. He is the author of Forensic Analytics which describes tests to detect fraud, errors, estimates, and biases in financial data and he is also the author of Benford's Law. Benford’s Law gives the expected patterns of the digits in tabulated data and it has been used by auditors and scientists to detect anomalies in tabulated data. His academic papers have been published in Auditing: A Journal of Practice and Theory, The Journal of the American Taxation Association, The Journal of Forensic Accounting, The Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting, and others. Other applied papers have been published in journals such as Mathematical Geology, The International Journal of Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences, and The International Journal of Algebra. His practitioner papers have been published in journals such as IEEE Potentials, Internal Auditor, and the Journal of Accountancy. Nigrini serves on the Executive Editorial Board of the International Journal of Disclosure and Governance  and also of the Journal of Forensic & Investigative Accounting. Nigrini's forensic work has been referenced in the national media including The Financial Times, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal,The Globe and Mail, and New Scientist. His work has also been featured in foreign language publications such as Der Spiegel. His radio interviews have included the BBC in London, and NPR in the United States. His television interviews have included appearances on NBC's Extra and The Investigation Discovery Channel for their series on Evil Twins. In October 2013 Nigrini delivered the prestigious Sufrin Lectureship in Accounting at the University at Buffalo. In April 2014 Nigrini presented a pre-conference workshop in Palm Springs, California at the annual conference of the National Association of Purchasing Card Professionals on using Forensic Analytics to detect purchasing card fraud, errors, waste and abuse. He also presented a keynote talk on Benford's Law at the same conference. In June 2014 he presented a pre-conference workshop in San Antonio, Texas at the annual global conference of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners on Benford's Law and Analytical Fraud Detection Techniques. In August 2014 Nigrini published an article, Lessons from an $8 million fraud, with Nathan J. Mueller who stole $8.45 million from his employer, an insurance company, over a four-year period. In the article Mueller describes his fraud scheme, how he explained his newfound wealth in the form of expensive cars, watches, nightlife entertainment, and Las Vegas gambling trips, to his wife and friends, and ultimately how he was caught. Mueller served his sentence at Federal Prison Camp, Duluth, a minimum security federal prison. He was released on February 27, 2015. In the article Nigrini reviews the preventive and detective anti-fraud measures that could have detected the multimillion-dollar fraud long before it was detected, quite by chance, after four years. The Journal of Accountancy is the flagship publication of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. In August, 2015 the Journal of Accountancy announced that Nigrini and Mueller had won the prestigious Lawler Prize for the best article in 2014. Nigrini has a B.Com (Hons) degree from the University of Cape Town, an MBA degree from the University of Stellenbosch, and a PhD degree from the University of Cincinnati. In addition to his academic credentials, Nigrini passed the Chartered Accountant (South Africa) exam in 1981 and his early accounting career included time with Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. (now KPMG) and as a divisional accountant. Nigrini has served as an expert witness and has done consulting engagements for large international organisations and government departments at the state level."

  "text" : "Maria Magdalena Eek (1733–1800), was a Finnish pastry chef. Based in Turku, she had a successful career and was a notable artist within her trade, eventually being granted a Royal warrant of appointment. Maria Magdalena Eek was the daughter of the city official Henric Eek. She never married. In 1782, she was given permission from the city authorities to manufacture and sell all forms of bread which was not included in the monopoly of the baker's guild, which in fact meant dessert bread such as cakes. She was given the permission granted to all women outside of the guilds: this entitled her to make and sell only what she had made with hr own hands and only enough for her to support herself, which meant that she could not employ people in her business. She was also never registered as a baker, which makes the dates of her business difficult to trace. Despite these conditions, Eek managed to circumvent the restrictions: she supported not only herself but her sister and foster daughter, bought a house, had several assistants employed (which she referred to as only domestics) and had her pastries sold by sellers all over town. Her successes caused constant lawsuits from the members of the baker's guild during the 1780s."

  "text" : "Mo Kwan-nin, GBM (1937 – 5 February 2013) was a Hong Kong born People's Republic of China politician. Mo Kwan-nin was born in Hong Kong in 1937 and graduated from the Chinese Department of the University of Hong Kong in 1961. He later joined the Methodist College in Yau Ma Tei as a Chinese language and Chinese history teacher. He was put in charge of the school's curriculum. In 1984, Mo joined the Hong Kong office of the Xinhua News Agency, the de facto representative office of People's Republic China government in the colonial period. He was appointed as deputy director in 1987, becoming the highest ranking Hong Kong born official at that time. It was seen as a Chinese Communist Party gesture to show its recognition of Hongkongers. Mo served alongside Lu Ping as the deputy secretary-general of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee and the secretary-general of the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee, the two organs responsible for drafting the Hong Kong's mini-constitution under Chinese rule after 1997. Hong Kong-based political commentator Johnny Lau Yui-siu said Mo became an underground member of the Communist Party after he joined Xinhua. However, it was not disclosed until the China News Service accidentally exposed his membership in a report during the 13th CPC National Congress. According to Lau, Mo's role became less significant after the disclosure. Mo's support of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 also significantly diverged from Beijing's and his career was in limbo after that. In 2000, Mo was honoured with the Grand Bauhinia Medal. Mo died from an undisclosed illness on 2 February 2013 7:02 p.m. in a local hospital at the age of 76. Johnny Lau praised Mo, saying he had served Beijing with pure intention, which was rare at that time. \"What he had given to the country was much more than what he could earn back,\" Lau said. Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying also paid tribute, saying that Mo was committed to serve Hong Kong and involved in the preparatory work for the transfer of sovereignty. \"He has made outstanding contributions to both the country and Hong Kong,\" Leung said."

  "text" : "Max Ernst Wichura (27 January 1817, Neisse – February 1866, Berlin) was a German lawyer and botanist. A lawyer by vocation, he studied jurisprudence in Breslau and Bonn. In 1859 he was appointed as a government councillor (Regierungsrath) in Breslau, a position he maintained until his death in 1866. He studied botany as a gymnasium student in Breslau, where one of his instructors was Friedrich Wimmer. As a law student at Bonn, he continued his botanical research, conducting studies on plant shoot morphology and systematics, especially of freshwater algae and mosses. During the summer of 1846, he embarked on a botanical excursion to Austrian Silesia, and ten years later, took part in an expedition to Lapland (1856). Afterwards, he performed cryptogamic investigations on trips to the Alps and Carpathians. In 1859, he participated as a botanist on a Prussian expedition to Eastern Asia, where he visited Singapore, Manila and various coastal areas of China and Japan. As a botanist, he was an expert on the willow genus Salix. Known for his pioneer research involving plant hybrids, he is credited with recreating a number of naturally occurring hybrids. He corresponded with Charles Darwin in regards to hybridization, and Gregor Mendel was familiar with his research of willow hybrids. The popular rose species Rosa wichuraiana is named after him, as is the subgenus Wichuraea, circumscribed by Max Joseph Roemer in 1847."

  "text" : "Markus Raetz (born 6 June 1941) is a Swiss painter, illustrator and sculptor. Born in Büren an der Aare near Bern, Raetz obtained a teacher's education and taught primary school until 1963, when he embarked on an artist's career with stays in Bern, Amsterdam, Carona (Ticino) and Berlin. He married Monika Müller in 1970, and has a daughter with her, Aimée. Since the 1960s, Raetz has created numerous works, including more than 30,000 drawings. His work focused on drawings and paintings in the 1960s and 1970s, and continued with sculptures in the 1980s and 1990s, beginning with the sculpture Der Kopf in the Merian Park in Basel (1984). The principal topic of his work is the nature of perception. His works do not focus on what they portray, but on how they are perceived. They often require interaction by the viewer, and can be understood only when viewed in motion or from different angles. Raetz has exhibited works at numerous international exhibitions, including at documenta 4, 5 and 7. Works by him are held by public collections including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Schaulager in Basel, the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt, the Kunstmuseum Basel and the Kunstmuseum Bern. He was awarded, among other recognitions, the Prix Meret Oppenheim in 2006 and the Gerhard-Altenbourg-Preis in 2004.  He is represented by the gallery Farideh Cadot Associés since 1981."

The Coney Island amusement park in Brooklyn was another favorite site during that period. His later work depicts street scenes from downtown Los Angeles and Tijuana, Mexico.

  "text" : "Michele Prisco (18 January 1920 – 19 November 2003) was a prolific Italian journalist, critic, and novelist. Prisco was born and educated in Torre Annunziata. His family provided the middle-class background central to many of his books. He studied law and took examinations to become a solicitor, but decided instead on a career as a writer. In 1942, his first short story, \"Gli alianti\", was published in a monthly supplement to the newspaper Il Corriere della sera. Before being mobilised, he worked as a staff member on the Gazetta del Popolo de Turin, and during the long months at the front he continued to make contributions; several of his acquaintances from this time were to become lifelong friends. These included the writers Gino Montesanto and Mario Pomilio, and the painter Enrico Accatino. In 1949 he published his first novel, La provincia addormentata, which won the Strega gold medal for the best newcomer. The following year, he won the Venezia Prize for an unpublished work, Gli eredi del vento. In 1951 he married and relocated to Naples, where he would live until his death. His early works, such as La provincia addormentata, Eredi del vento and Figli difficili, describe the Neapolitan middle class, with all its foibles and limitations, and in particular its inability to find a way out of the social and economic stagnation that weighed on the city at this time. Prisco later explored other social strata, but studiously avoided the impressionistic and folkloric mannerisms that were typical of post-war writers of this region. During the 1960s he collaborated with Mario Pomilio, Domenico Rea, Luigi Incoronato, Gianfranco Venè and Leone Pacini Savoj on the literary review Le ragioni narrative, which he would edit throughout his life. He continued to work as a journalist and film critic. He was the vice secretary of the National Writers' Union for a decade. The novel Una spirale di nebbia (1966, translated into English in 1969) won him the Strega Prize and was made into an acclaimed film. He died in 2003."

  "text" : "Marcus Lindblom is an American video game developer known for his English localization of the 1995 video game EarthBound. Lindblom spent his youth in the United States, and dropped out of college to move to Japan with his wife. After four years, he returned to college in the United States and began to work at Nintendo of America's call center. He eventually worked on Japanese-to-English game localization projects such as Wario's Woods and EarthBound. Lindblom worked with a translator and a writer to accurately translate the game for a Western audience. He sought to stay true to Shigesato Itoi's script, but was given latitude to make the script as weird as he wanted, and so added in American cultural allusions. Lindblom considers the localization his highest achievement. He worked at Nintendo until 1996, when he left to work at other developers including Electronic Arts, Vivendi Games, Midway Games, and THQ. He established Partly Cloudy Games with friends around 2009, and as of 2013, runs mobile games studio Carried Away Games. After following the fan community from afar, he came out to fans in mid 2012 and the press began to show greater interest in his work. He had planned to write a book about the game's development, release, and fandom as a Kickstarter project before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea."

His early aptitude for philosophy (his main interest was the works of David Hume) was recognised and he received his doctorate in Philosophy from Louvain, becoming Professor of Ethics in 1960. His straightforward manner and capacity for thoughtful decision-making saw him appointed Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy in 1973 and later still, vice-president of Maynooth. to Monsignor Miceal Ledwith. When Ledwith resigned suddenly in 1994 in contested and perhaps controversial circumstances, it was natural that the then Irish Primate Cahal C. Daly would press for his old friend and philosophical colleague Matt O'Donnell to be made College President. For that generosity of service to Maynooth as it headed into its bicentenary year, O'Donnell should be remembered. Dr. O'Donnell died on September 7, 1996, having suffered a heart attack earlier that year. Two postgraduate scholarships for Maynooth College were named in his honour one in Philosophy and one in Theology.He spent some of his childhood in Maynooth where his mother was from and is buried with his parents in Grangewilliam Cemetery just outside Maynooth Town."

  "text" : "Maurice Power (1811-1870) was member of parliament for County Cork (1847-1852) and served as Lieutenant Governor for St Lucia from 1852. He was born in Deelish, Skibbereen, County Cork, the fourth son of Andrew Power. He was educated at Stonyhurst College and subsequently qualified as a doctor. He travelled to America where he married Catherine Livingston in 1832; she was the youngest daughter of Judge Henry Brockholst Livingston and Catherine (Seaman) Kortright. Power returned to Ireland and became involved with local politics, supporting the Repeal Party. He was appointed a member of the Clonakilty bench of magistrates, but resigned in 1843 when a fellow magistrate was dismissed by the Lord Chancellor for attending a political meeting. He was reappointed in 1846 and became a magistrate in Cove. In 1847, Daniel O'Connell, the member of parliament for County Cork died. Maurice Power was selected to stand as the Repeal Party candidate, winning the election and holding the seat until 1852. In 1852 Power was appointed the Lieutenant-Governor for St Lucia. This was received with incredulity amongst those who had supported his election campaign. They believed that he had pledged not to take a government appointment, and that he was now being rewarded for supporting the ruling Whig party, in particular Lord Clarendon during the Birch affair.Power retired from his posting in St Lucia in 1855, moving to Freiburg in Prussia on health grounds. He returned to Cork in the early 1860s, purchasing Ringacoltig House and Estate, resuming interest in local politics. He died there on 28 December 1870, buried locally, although his remains were exhumed in the following year, and re-buried in the family plot in Rosscarbery."

She joined Olympic teammate Wyomia Tyus in going to women's track powerhouse Tennessee State University. She was the American Indoor Champion in the Long Jump 9 times; in 1965, 1967-9 and 1972-1976. She also won three USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, 1973-5 before losing to the high school phenom Kathy McMillan, who also went on to Tennessee State University. Watson continued competing, jumping in the USA vs USSR meet of 1979, with the goal of making the 1980 Olympic team. When President Jimmy Carter announced the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott, that \"killed the spark.\" By that point in time she had already found employment dealing Blackjack at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Watson competed toward the end of the amateur era, when athletes were not officially allowed to make money from their athletic efforts. \"There was always a lot of talk about people slipping money into your shoes,\" she said, smiling. \"Well, I left my shoes everywhere and they were always empty when I came back. \"It's a whole different world now. You're not only competing for wins, you're competing for contracts as well. \"All of that negotiating requires a lot of politics, and I always found it hard to compete and be political at the same time. \"I mean, I never made any money from it, but I do have lots of memories and friends all over the world. That's what I was about then.\"— Martha Watson quoted in the Los Angeles Times, 1988"

  "text" : "Mary Ellen Spring Rice (14 September 1880 – 1 December 1924) was an Irish nationalist activist during the early 20th century. Spring Rice was born into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family in London. She was the daughter of Thomas Spring Rice, 2nd Baron Monteagle of Brandon, and a great-granddaughter of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Thomas Spring Rice. Her maternal grandfather was the bishop, Samuel Butcher. She was brought up on the family's Mount Trenchard estate overlooking the River Shannon. It was a progressive, liberal household and independence of thought was encouraged. So too was the Gaelic culture and, at home, Spring Rice and her brothers were taught how to speak fluent Irish. Before the First World War, Spring Rice hosted many Irish nationalist and Conradh na Gaeilge meetings at her home, and she became a close friend of Douglas Hyde and her cousin Nelly O'Brien. During 1913 and 1914, Spring Rice was actively involved in gun-running, most notably the Howth gun-running. This involved helping to ship weapons to be used in an Irish uprising from Germany into Ireland. Together with Molly Childers, she raised £2,000 towards the purchase of 900 Mauser rifles from Germany, many of which were used in the 1916 Easter Rising. Spring Rice sailed on the Asgard to collect the guns and helped to unload them in Ireland. During the Irish War of Independence, she allowed her Mount Trenchard home to be used as a safe house by Irish Republican Army fighters and the family boat was used to carry men and arms over the Shannon Estuary. Con Collins stayed with her regularly. She helped train local women as nurses to tend to wounded nationalists and acted as an IRA message carrier between Limerick and Dublin. Throughout this time, she maintained her aristocratic façade and society connections, inviting senior Liberal Party politicians to Mount Trenchard to pressure them to support Irish independence."

Years later, she moved to Paris to study at the Académie Julian. In 1950, she arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina to visit her brother, her only living family member. Here, she was appointed professor at the Artes Visuales de Buenos Aires and exhibited at the Galería Pizarro. She participated in the Premio Palanza Buenos Aires. She received the Benito Quinquela Martín award at the Eduardo Sívori Museum, and was honored by the Argentine Senate. Her works are part of the collections at the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Paris, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires.

One of her many successful endeavors, the matching Sweethearts in Swimsuits line for men and women in the 1940s, helped establish her reputation for innovation at Catalina. In 1951 she founded her own company in Los Angeles, DeWeese Designs, which produced sportswear and swimwear offering exceptional fit and construction. Her sundresses and loungewear were particularly successful, and she continued to use texture in unique ways and to introduce useful innovations such as the stretch strap for clothing and swimwear. DeWeese Designs remained in operation into the 1980s."

  "text" : "Megan Whitmarsh (born 1972 in Cambridge, Massachusetts) is an American artist living in Los Angeles, California. Whitmarsh received an MFA from the University of New Orleans and a BFA from the Kansas City Art Institute, both in painting. Working predominantly with textiles, Whitmarsh uses hand-stitched embroidery to fabricate replicas of personal and cultural ephemera. Her embroidered canvases and soft sculptures reference contemporary pop culture and the 1970s and '80s eras of her childhood. Her most recent body of work, Fabricated Revisions, consists of \"imagined, handmade revisions\" of past covers of prominent art magazines, featuring female artists who were overlooked at the time. About this body of work, Whitmarsh notes, \"The way that I am interested in feminism is the way I am interested in many things. It's something peripheral to my view that influences my vision rather than being a focus. I am interested in watching the process of feminism rather than trying to locate it. I don't believe I could locate it… The artists I find compelling are mostly women and I decided to pay tribute to this personal fact. Many of these works are from a fictionalized past. From 1970-1980, Artforum devoted 5 of its 99 covers to women artists.\" Whitmarsh has shown her work internationally, including solo exhibitions at New Image Art, Jack Hanley (NY), Elaine Levy Project (Brussels), Kling & Bang Gallery (Reykjavik), Krets Galleri (Malmo), and Katherine Mulherin Contemporary Art Projects (Toronto), among others. Her work has been included in group shows at the Zürich Museum of Design, Wolfsonian Museum (at Art Basel Miami Beach), Galerie Libraire (Hong Kong), White Columns and Gavin Brown's Enterprise as part of the Drunk vs. Stoned show. In 1996 Whitmarsh began creating merchandise under the moniker \"Tiny Industries\", self-publishing Snow Monkey comic books, producing puppet shows and 6mm stop action short films as well as making hand-embroidered wallets and bags. Since 2006, Tiny Industries has been on hiatus due to the demands of Whitmarsh's fine art career. In 2010, Whitmarsh was commissioned by Amy Sedaris to do the embroidery for \"Simple Times, Crafts for Poor People\". She was also commissioned by David Byrne to embroider the cover artwork of his \"Ride Rise Roar\" tour DVD. Todd Oldham has used two of her drawings for paint-by-numbers sets in his Kid Made Modern line of craft and art projects for children. Between 1998 and 2000, Whitmarsh played keyboard as a founding member of the instrumental band The Hong Kong, with Harold Griffin, Matt Salata, and Aaron Carroll."

As first lady, she introduced many changes in dress and social attitude in gender roles: she made the upper class women of Ecuador cast off the black costumes they dressed in at the time and adopt European fashion in bright colors, and she also liberated women's space of movement by making it acceptable for women to walk in the streets without a male guardian as company, after setting an example by doing so herself in her position as first lady, walking about in the streets in public alone or in the company of a female friend. In 1882, her uncle was absent from the capital of Quito in another part of the country. When civil war broke out during his absence, she took control of the capital, the government and its military forces in the name of her uncle's office and commanded the defense of Quite when it was attacked by the rebels in 1883. She was a such referred to as Generalita. She was the first female in Ecuador to have wielded such power. After the defeat, she was imprisoned. She was released in 1884 and forced into exile.

  "text" : "According to \"Pallas Lexikon\" --- Galeotti (Galeotto) Marzio (Martius) was a humanist, poet, philosopher,and astrologer in the 15th century. He was born in Narni (Umbria) around 1427, and died in Bohemia in 1497. He studied the culture, language and literature of the classical ancient times from his early youth. After serving as a soldier for a short period, in 1447 he became a pupil of Guarino in Ferrara. Here he became an intimate friend of JanusPannonius, who was a Hungarian student there at that time, and later became a bishop of Pécs (in Southern Hungary). Galeotti learned the Greek language from Janus Pannonius. After a pilgrimage to Rome Galeotti gave lectures in 1450 at the University of Padova about classical authors, and studied medicine as well. In Padova he married a Venetian (or, according to some sources, Lombardian) girl. She was a daughter of Bartolomeo di Montagna)*. They had a son,Giovanni, and several daughters. After the death of his Italian wife he married a Hungarian noblewoman (her family name was Szepessy). In March 1461 he was in Hungary (probably in Buda) together with his family, in the company of Janus Pannonius. After a short-term stay in Padova, in 1462 he spent a longer time travelling in Spain, France andEngland, practising medicine. In his book (2 volumes), De Homine, he reflects on the physical and philosophic aspects of human nature and his main concern if the well-being of man. The first volume reflects on the external aspects of the human body whereas the second discusses the nature of some diseases and the internal aspects of the human organism. During his journey he made friends and earned a considerable amount of money. In 1464 he was professor of the Latin language at the University of Bologna. Here Galeotti had an intensive polemic with Francis Philelphus. In 1468 Janus Pannonius - who at that time was on a mission in Italy - took him to Hungary. Galeotti spent a long time in the court of King Matthias Corvinus where the king soon took a liking to him. Galeotti became a confidant, companion and court historian of King Matthias. However, there are no reliable sources stating that Galeotti was the tutor of King Matthias or that of Matthias' son, Johannes Corvinus. Galeotti accompanied King Matthias on his campaign to Bohemia against the Czech King George Podiebrad. In 1471 he wrote a book in Buda of the title \"De homine libri duo\" about physiology and medicine, a descriptionof the parts of the body. This book was dedicated to Archbishop Janos Vitacz, who was the uncle of Janus Pannonius. From 1473 to 1477 Galeotti gave lectures in Bologna about humanistic studies.He wrote between 1476 and 1478 his book of the title \"De incognitis vulgo\", which was dedicated to King Matthias. The book is still unpublished. As he expressed in his book the heretical view that all men, who live according to common sense and the laws of nature, will find salvation - he was arrested by the Venetian inquisition on his estate in Montagna near Padova, and they had him before the court. His property was confiscated, his wife was also put to prison, he was put on the pillory on the market of Venice, his book was burned, and he was forced to publicly recant his \"diabolical\" doctrines. He was in prison for 6 months, on dry bread and cold water. Pope IV. Sixtus cited him to Rome on the intervention of Lorenzo di Medici and King Matthias. Here he was cleared of the charge of heresy and he even regained his properties. In 1479 he spent some time in the court of King Matthias, however, he returned to Italy soon. In 1482 he asked from King Matthias for an engagement present for his daughters in Baden near Vienna, and received it. From 1484 to 1487 - supposedly in Italy - he wrote his book of the title \"De egregie, sapienter et iocose dictis ac factis Matthiae regis\" (About the excellent, sapient and ingenious sayings and deeds of King Matthias. First published by Sigismund Tordai in 1563. Translated into Hungarian language in the 19th century by Gabor Kazinczy and Ferdinand Barna.). This work contains many interesting data relating to the history of culture in Hungary, anecdotes and characteristic stories about King Matthias and his court. The book was dedicated to Prince Joannes Corvinus, son of King Matthias. Galeotti dedicated one of his books, La Doctrina Promiscua, to Lorenzo di Medici, and another in 1492 to Charles VIII, King of France, in whose court he spent some time after the death of King Matthias (who died in 1490). The title of thisbook was \"De Excellentibus\", this was a somewhat abridged and revised version of another of his books: \"De promiscua doctrina\". Until now it is not confirmed that the members of the Martius family living nowadays in Germany are Galeotti's descendants. Martius Galeotti (1442-1494) was an Italian astrologer, born in Narni, Umbria. He settled first in Boulogne and then went to Hungary after his religious views proved unpopular with the Catholic Church. In Hungary he became secretary to King, Matthias Corvinus, and also tutor to the latter's son, Prince John. His work De jocose Dictis et Factis Regis Matthhias Covirni further incurred the displeasure of the church and he was taken to Venice where he was imprisoned for a time. He was released following the intervention of Pope Sixtus IV, whose tutor he is said to have been at an earlier date. He subsequently returned to France where he became state-astrologer to King Louis XI. Galeotti appears in Sir Walter Scott's story of medieval France, Quentin Durward."

Following the war, Flanagan was stationed in the British Mandate Palestine. Being sympathetic with the emerging (Jewish) nation of Israel, on 29 June 1948, Flanagan (along with his tank commander, Harry McDonald) stole two British Cromwell tanks and drove them to Israeli forces in Tel Aviv. These became central to the Israeli Armored Corps. Flanagan is considered one of the most famous deserters from the British Army in Palestine. Flanagan subsequently converted to Judaism to marry Ruth Levy, whom he had met on active service. They lived in Israel until her death, after which he emigrated to Canada."

  "text" : "Marion Freschl (née Szekely) (January 16, 1896 - November 23, 1984, New York City) was an American operatic contralto and voice teacher of Hungarian descent. A member of the voice faculties at the Curtis Institute of Music and the Juilliard School, she taught several highly successful singers, including Marian Anderson, Joan La Barbara, Brenda Lewis, Joanna Simon, Shirley Verrett, and Camilla Williams.

  "text" : "Mario Sanchez (7 October 1908 – 28 April 2005) was a Cuban-American folk artist from the Key West cigar-making neighborhood known as \"Gato's Village\". Self-taught, Sanchez began working artistically in 1930 on media like paper bags and cedar wood boards. He would come to specialize in bas relief wood carvings that he would then paint over in vibrant colors, usually depicting scenes of everyday Key West life. Some of his carvings have been valued at more than $50,000. Described as a \"memory artist\" like Grandma Moses or Clementine Hunter, after earning a business degree in stenography in 1925, Sanchez went to Ybor City in Tampa to work as a clerk. In 1930, he was hired at the Monroe County Courthouse as a translator and stenographer, and so returned home to Key West. He explored his creative streak by writing comedic Spanish-language skits for the San Carlos playhouse and by whittling small fish native to the Florida Keys. This carving would carry over into his more lasting works of art, where he would carve scenes into wooden panels, then illustrate them with highly detailed paint work. He has been called the most important Cuban-American folk artist of the 20th century."

  "text" : "Maurice Handford (1929 – 16 December 1986) was a British horn player and conductor. Handford was born in Salisbury. He was principal horn of the Hallé Orchestra 1949–61, then associate conductor 1966–71, and staff conductor. He died in Warminster. The following article was published in the Daily Telegraph on the 17th December 1986, shortly after his death: \"Maurice Handford who has died aged 58, was a conductor with a wide range in repertoire. Although he was perhaps not a familiar figure to concert goers on the South Bank, he was well known to audiences in the rest of the country and from 1971 to 1975 was principal conductor of the Calgary Symphony Orchestra. Born in Salisbury, he studied at the Royal Academy of Music. He was a horn player and for 12 years, from 1949 to 1961, he was principal Horn in Barbirolli's Hallé. Although he did not have a big tone, he had a natural feeling for tone colour and was unfailingly accurate, one rarely heard a 'fluff' in any of his orchestral solos. He had ambitions to be a conductor and was assisted by the patronage of ICI (Blackley), which invited him to conduct the works orchestra and, in May 1960, sponsored a Hallé concert in Manchester at which he conducted Berlioz’s Symphony Fantastique. He was also helped by Barbirolli, who invited him to conduct some Hallé industrial concerts. By 1962 he was sufficiently launched to be given charge of the first Hallé performance of Orff’s Carmina Burana. Soon he was conducting works of the size of Strauss’s Also sprach Zarathustra and Shostakovich's 12th symphony. Barbirolli concert. Through the rest of the 1960s, until Barbirolli’s death in 1970, Handford conducted most of the adventurous works in the Hallé repertoire and in 1963 was appointed Associate Conductor, at first jointly with Lawrence Leonard, but after 1966 on his own. Sir John trusted him enough to let him conduct Elgar and Vaughan Williams symphonies in which he himself excelled, but Handford never followed his mentor into Mahler and Bruckner. He was responsible for performances of Messiaen’s Turangalila Symphony, Schoenberg's Erwartung and for introducing to Manchester the music of Lutoslawski and Penderecki. But no assignment was more difficult than in September, 1970 when he conducted Elgar's Dream of the Gerontius in memory of Barbirolli, a performance that rose both musically and emotionally to the occasion. Handford had every expectation that the Hallé conductorship would then be his. He was bitterly resentful when he was passed over and in 1971 he resigned as Associate Conductor, the Hallé management had probably reasoned that he had not at that time had sufficient experience with other orchestras and that he was not a “personality” as far as audiences were concerned. Nevertheless, it was still to Handford that the Hallé turned when a Bruno Maderna concert had to be undertaken at short notice or when Elgar’s The Apostles and Delius’s Mass of Life needed revival, or a concert version of Porgy and Bess was planned. He was by now in demand with other orchestras, such as the BBC Northern and Welsh, the CBSO and the Ulster, where his willingness to take on the unfamiliar was appreciated. Unobtrusive style He was for a time a conductor of the Liverpool Welsh Choral Union and until 1972 conducted the annual opera and choral performances of the Northern School of Music, Manchester. His virtues as a trainer of students were also recognised by the Royal Academy of Music, where he conducted several remarkable performances. Although the compilers of ‘New Grove’ did not consider him worthy of inclusion and record companies virtually ignored him, Handford's unobtrusive style and his ability to get to the heart of a score were appreciated by musicians. He was not the flamboyant maestro and this may have held back his career in quarters where flashier talents are admired. But those who heard his finest Elgar performances and his lucid readings of complex contemporary works will know that music making in this country is much the poorer for his premature and lamented death.\""

  "text" : "M'hamed Ababou  (Arabic: امحمد أعبابو‎‎; 1938 – 10 July 1971) was a senior Moroccan Army officer. Along with General Mohamed Medbouh he instigated an attempted coup against king Hassan II on 10 July 1971. M'hamed Ababou was the director of the Ahermoumou military non-commissioned officer training school. Acting under his orders, about 1,200 cadets from the school seized the Royal summer palace at Skhirat where a diplomatic function was being held to celebrate the King's forty-second birthday. Foreign and Moroccan VIPs were held under guard or fled along the nearby seafront. Approximately 100 guests, officials, servants and cadets were reported killed under confused circumstances. It was to be subsequently claimed that the young cadets had been told by Ababou and other officers that they were acting to protect King Hassan against rebels. Initially the only loyalist troops present at the palace were ceremonial guards and the king took refuge in a pavilion annex. Ababou was killed on the day of the coup during an exchange of fire with royal troops led by General Bouhali, who had been dispatched to the palace to rescue the king. It is reported that Ababou was only wounded in this clash but had asked a fellow conspirator to shoot him so that he would not be taken alive. M'hamed Ababou had two brothers in the military; Mohamed (his elder by 4 years) with whom he co-organized the attempted coup and who would die in detention in 1976; and a younger brother named Abdelziz Ababou who died during the coup itself."

  "text" : "Matt Graham (born 23 October 1994) is an Australian freestyle skier. He was a finalist at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Matt joined the Perisher Winter Sports Club mogul program at the age of six, and he has been skiing ever since. Some of his major achievements so far include: \n*  Matt first made his mark on the world stage as a 15-year-old, placing 27th in his debut in the final World Cup qualification event prior to the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games.  \n*  In 2013 he achieved fourth place at this first World Championships in Voss, Norway. \n*  Also in 2013, he finished seventh at the Sochi Olympic test World Cup event. \n*  At the Sochi Olympics in 2014, Matt placed seventh in the finals of the Men's Moguls. Matt is a graduate of the Central Coast Grammar School, and he has maintained his ties with the school since graduating. He is studying towards his Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) and Bachelor of Business at the University of Newcastle. ORIGINSMatthew Graham was born 23 October, 1994, in Narara, a northern suburb of Gosford. Gosfors is a surfing town on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia—90 minutes north of Sydney. He lives with his parents in the house where he was raised. Graham has three older siblings: Eliza (6 yrs. older), David (4 yrs. older), and Heidi (2 yrs. older). He is about to be an uncle for the first time. INTRODUCTION TO MOGULSGraham’s father skied growing up, and encouraged his mother to take up the sport when Matt was a toddler. The family took their first ski holiday when he was three.When Graham was 6 (2000) the family joined a ski program at Perisher Winter Sports Club in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales. The Grahams drove six hours south to spend every weekend there from early-July to mid-September each year. At first Graham participated in every class the resort offered, including slopestyle (obstacle course racing), alpine racing, and mogul jumping. A year later (2001), moguls were Graham’s specialty.Graham was on the New South Wales Institute of Sport (NSWIS) team, which is the Australian Olympic development team, starting when he was 12. He’s been on the Olympic team (Olympic Winter Institute of Australia (OWIA)) since he was 15. OTHER THAN MOGULS...Before moguls took over, Graham raced 8’, single-sail Sabot sailboats with his brother. Graham was 4 times Australian and 6 times state champions, winning 2 state titles with his brother. He and David were approached by Yachting Australia, the national sporting organization for sailing, and asked to join the Australian sailing development team and train for the Olympics. That’s when both boys chose moguls over Sabots.Though he’s a little nostalgic about sailing, Graham feels more suited for mogul skiing. He likes the action.Graham is a graduate of the Central Coast Grammar School. He discovered a joy for leaning around 10th grade, when he began spending a few weeks each year away from school for his sport. Presently Graham studies independently while training most of the year in North America, returning home for exams each term. INFLUENCING FACTORSThe Grahams have a close-knit family, and Matt looks up its patriarchs. His grandfather who owns the civil engineering firm his great grandfather founded with the purchase of an excavator 50+ years ago. Graham is studying engineering at University of Newcastle and hopes to work with his grandfather one day.Graham accesses most of his coursework online, and is grateful to the teachers and university professors who have worked around his training schedule.Graham also looks up to his older brother David. Growing up, his siblings observed that if David did it, Matt wanted to learn. David sailed; so Matt sailed. The Graham brothers won 2 state titles sailing together. David did moguls; so Matt does moguls. When David chose moguls over sailing, Matt followed. It’s become a joke in the family.Graham started beating his brother on moguls at 14.Sporting-wise, Graham has been greatly influenced by Australian mogul skier Dale Begg-Smith. Begg-Smith is a transplant who skied for Australia’s national ski team. He emigrated from Canada when he was 16 because his Canadian coaches complained that he was spending too much time on his Internet business, and not enough time training. He was considerably invested in his company, and chose to relocate rather than choose between his business and his sport. Begg-Smith and his brother were welcomed to Australia, who had a smaller program that offered greater flexibility. After three years he qualified for citizenship, and was able to compete for his adopted country. He took Olympic gold in 2006; silver in 2010. Graham was 13 when Begg-Smith took a couple months off in Winter 2008 tocoach him. Begg-Smith has been Graham’s mentor ever since.HIGH POINTS“Matt first made his mark on the world stage as a 15-year-old, placing 27th in his debut in the final World Cup qualification event prior to the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games.” (Wikipedia)“In 2013 he achieved fourth place at this first World Championships in Voss, Norway.” (Wikipedia)“Also in 2013, he finished seventh at the Sochi Olympic test World Cup event.” (Wikipedia)At the Sochi Olympics in 2014, Matt was “agonizingly close” to making the super-final in Sochi, finishing just 0.01 of a point behind American Patrick Deneen in Final 2, placing seventh in the finals of the Men's Moguls. (Partly quoted from Wikipedia) LOW POINTS:In September 2010, Graham was diagnosed with a stress fracture in his lumbar spine at L5. He was benched for 8 months. The first 3 months he had to be completely inactive to let the fracture repair. No running, swimming, walking, and no sitting or standing for long periods of time.Graham had elbow surgery in July 2015 after a leisure-time accident during an Australia team training camp in Park City, Utah. On July 11th he was playing volleyball with his teammates, when the ball went over a chest-high wooden fence. Graham frog-leapt the fence to retrieve the ball. On his return vault, the fence collapsed and brought Graham down on his right elbow, snapping the radial head off his ulna. Graham flew home for surgery once an x-ray determined a diagnosis. LOOKING AHEAD...A gold is possibly in the cards for Matt at the Olympic games in 2018 (age 23) in Pyeongchang, South Korea. He hopes to compete in the 2022 Olympics in Beijing, China, (when he is 27).AFTER SPORTGraham always expected that he’d go to college, and never imagined mogul skiing would be a long-term career. (Mogul skiing is a relatively small sport.) MISCELLANYMogulsMogul skiers are susceptible to low back and knee injuries. Once they’re in their late 20s, the majority of mogul jumpers feel pain consistently while they ski. The fastest mogul skiers in the world take about 3 moguls a second. It’s a high impact sport.Folks at homeGraham’s friends back home mean a lot to him, and when they’re together they enjoy surfing, sailing, wakeboarding, and waterskiing. TeammatesGraham’s ski teammates are good friends and a bunch of practical jokers.Other passionsWhen he’s not skiing, Graham passionately pursues his university coursework. He loves mathematics, and pursuing education in general. His time at home is especially precious, and he uses it to enjoy the coastal life he was raised to love. He tries to get out on the water as much as he can when he’s home. RegretsGraham doesn’t have any major regrets. He sometimes thinks he misses sailing until he remembers that he chose between sailing and moguls. He’s not sorry he chose moguls.Although not holding onto any big regrets, there’s one thing he wishes he’d have done a little differently: When he was in Sochi, Russia for the 2012 Olympics, Graham had a couple of weeks of free time after the Games, which he spent socializing and relaxing at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort. Only on the last day he decided to go skiing. Spending his last day on the mountain, Graham realized he was at one of the best resorts in the world, and he’d missed hisopportunity to enjoy its slopes."

Donoghue co-wrote and co-produced Deceived (1991) and two year later, her first play, Me and Mamie O'Rourke, made its debut at the Strand Theatre in London. In the 2000s, Donoghue wrote the screenplay for White Oleander (2002) and co-wrote Veronica Guerin (2003) with Carol Doyle. In 2013, Donoghue wrote and directed Jenny's Wedding."

He was a cousin of the prominent Abbasid general Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin, thus belonging to the ruling family of Ushrusana. Mankjur accompanied al-Afshin in his campaign against the Khurramite Babak Khorramdin, and was later appointed as governor of Adharbayjan by him in 837. However, in 839, Mankjur, after refusing to give the caliph al-Mu'tasim some of Babak's booty, revolted against him. Al-Mu'tasim responded by sending against him Bugha al-Kabir, who managed to suppress his revolt and imprison him in Samarra. The affair of Mankjur raised suspicions about the loyalty of the al-Afshin, who was accused of encouraging the revolt, and contributed to the general's own downfall in the following year."

She is a contributing editor to the Myanmar Times and editor of Enchanting Myanmar, a travel magazine. She is also an English translator, having translated the works of Khin Hnin Yu and other Burmese writers into English. Thanegi attended Methodist English High School, the Rangoon State School of Fine Arts, the Rangoon Institute of Economics, and Institute of Foreign Languages, where she studied German and French. Thanegi served as Aung San Suu Kyi's personal assistant before her arrest in 1989, following the 8888 Uprising. She served a prison term at Insein Jail until her release in 1992. She fell out of favor among the Burmese pro-democracy movement for her challenge to the National League for Democracy's doctrine that economic sanctions and tourism boycotts were harming the country's poor majority. In 1997, she published \"The Burmese Fairy Tale,\" an essay in the Far Eastern Economic Review, claiming that sanctions hurt the Burmese people without effectively changing the Burmese regime (then known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council)'s behavior."

Murphy's research on p53 has indicated that the gene is able to suppress tumors by inducing apoptosis in cells where DNA damage has occurred. She has focused in particular on various polymorphisms that might impact the ability of p53 to suppress tumors. Murphy's research has shown that certain variants are more common in certain ethnic groups, providing a possible explanation as to why certain types of cancer affect certain populations. Murphy serves on the international committee of the International p53 Workshop and served as co-chair of the workshop in 2010."

In April 2009, the Special Court under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) in Jammu acquitted those charged with Mushir-ul-Haq's murder after a trial which had lasted nineteen years. The Presiding Officer ruled that one confession was inadmissible and expressed doubts about the voluntary nature of others.

  "text" : "Michelle Fraley (née Hernández) is the first Puerto Rican woman to graduate from West Point Military Academy and the former chief of staff of the Army Network Enterprise Technology Command. After a 30-year military career, she retired from the United States Army in 2014 and returned to Puerto Rico, where she was appointed as special assistant to the Puerto Rico Police Superintendent, leading the Strategic Initiative Group. Subsequent to the resignation of James Tuller, the Police Superintendent who recruited her, her name surfaced as a potential successor. Her final of six commanding posts before retiring was as commander of the Walter Reed Warrior Transition Brigade (WTB) in the National Capital Area. As she completed her final post, she was described as a \"Wonder Woman\" in dealing with wounded warriors that returned from the battlefront to assume other roles in the military or transition into private life. Upon settling in Puerto Rico with her husband after retiring on January 27, 2014, she turned in a resume to Superintendent Tuller and was appointed to the $72,000-year job, where Fraley, who holds two master's degrees and a PhD in organizational leadership, is charged with analyzing the entire state police organization. Her appointment, while controversial, has been endorsed by the ACLU's Puerto Rico Chapter. The Puerto Rico Police Department operates under a consent decree with the United States Department of Justice. A Federal court-appointed monitor, supervised by United States District Judge Gustavo Gelpí, resigned in February, 2014. She studied at the Nuestra Señora de la Providencia Catholic School in the Cupey sector of San Juan and graduated High School from George O. Robinson School in the Condado sector of San Juan before moving on to West Point. Her 5-year military commitment after graduating turned into a 30-year military career."

  "text" : "Marina Chapman (born approximately 1950) is a Colombian-born British woman known for her claim to have spent much of her early childhood in the jungle, alone except for a colony of capuchin monkeys. Chapman states that when she was approximately four years old, she was taken from her village (whose name she was too young to have learned), and then released for a reason she did not understand; she spent the next several years following capuchin monkeys, until hunters rescued her — by which point she had no human language. According to Chapman, she later was sold to a brothel in Cúcuta, then lived on the streets, and then became a slave of a mafia family. A neighbour, Maruja, rescued her from her predicament. Maruja's daughter, Maria, adopted Chapman when Chapman was approximately 14, and Maruja sent Chapman to Bogota to live with one of her daughters. This family had connections to the city of Bradford, Yorkshire, England, through the textile industry. The family sent their children to Bradford in 1977 and sent Chapman to be a nanny. She had lived in Bradford since about 1983. She married a scientist in the Bradford area. She subsequently wrote her autobiography, \"The Girl With No Name\", (published 2013 by Mainstream Publishing) with the help of her daughter Vanessa; it was rejected by several publishers because they believed it was not authentic. Her daughter, Vanessa, was involved in creating the book. She currently lives in Bradford.Chapman and her husband have two children. National Geographic created the documentary Woman Raised By Monkeys. It premiered on Thursday 12 December 2013."

Her sister Lydia Maresca, herself an actress with the stage name Lidia Martora, was the wife of Peppino De Filippo. In 1938, at the age of 15, Maresca joined the company of Erminio Macario, becoming one of the comedy performers in Turin. Over the next decade, she worked with Carlo Dapporto, where, in imitation of Josephine Baker, Maresca appeared on stage in a thong and bra of bananas. In other shows, she performed topless, while in still others, she wore only the heads of three black fox to cover the appropriate areas. In 1946, she created her own company, and a few months later, she took on a young novice comedian, Walter Chiari, with whom she began a relationship. In 1950, she retired from acting to marry Count Corrado Agusta, owner (with his brothers) of Agusta; they had a son Richard, nicknamed Rocky. Maresca's husband left her for Francesca Vacca Graffagni."

  "text" : "Like other automobile pioneers Max Wenkel began his career as an engineer and inventor with the construction of bicycles. He built his first pennyfarthing bicycle while still an apprentice engineer, and was soon taking part in races with well-known cyclists such as Willy Tischbein, who later became Director General of the Continental-Caoutchouc and Guttapercha Company. He accompanied the future founder of the Adler Biycle and Automobile Company, Dr. Heinrich Kleyer, on a trip to study the manufacture of bicycles in England at the beginning of the 1880s. Later he was employed at the Duplex bicycle factory in Berlin. In 1895 he successfully experimented with a water velocipede on the rivers Leine and Ihme near Hanover. As early as 1899 he exhibited a small car at the First International Exhibition in Berlin. Between 1901 and 1903 Wenkel travelled through East India, Java, Sumatra and Borneo, where he built the first Wenkelmobils in rather primitive conditions. When back in Germany, the Berlin factory of Schneider & Co started the production of his Wenkelmobil. Wenkel won numerous prizes with it in races in its small-car class. In 1906 and 1907 he travelled the length of South America down to Patagonia in a Wenkelmobil. He was officially commissioned to open up the Cordillera region for motor traffic, and also built flat-bottomed speed boats suitable for Argentine rivers. Wenkel acquired several patents, e.g. for the Wenkelmobil’s friction drive and a high-speed compression and vacuum pump. The Berlin Directory lists him as engineer and owner of a technical bureau and export firm during WWI. When well over sixty he won the prestigious Garbaty Trophy with his speedboat \"Java II\", in 1929. Three years later he was still making his mark with the invention of a \"motor in a trunk car\", a newfangled though unsuccessful miniature automobile. An article in a boys’ yearbook in 1943 suggests that Wenkel died in that year, but his precise date of death has yet to be confirmed."

  "text" : "Marcel Bleibtreu (26 August 1918 – 25 December 2001) was a French trotskyist activist and theorist. Bleibtreu was born during his family's refuge in Marseille from wartime bombing, Marcel Bleibtreu became a radical thinker as a child. After studies at the lycée Condorcet, he studied medicine in Paris, and graduated in 1947. He joined the Groupe Bolchevik Léniniste, the Trotskyist organisation, in September 1936. By 1944 the GBL had merged with two other Trotskyist currents to form the Internationalist Communist Party, (PCI), the French section of the Fourth International. Bleibtreu led workplace cells of the PCI around Puteaux-Suresnes-Nanterre under the pen-name Pierre Favre. In November 1944, he became an editor of the party's journal, La Vérité. He was named general secretary of the PCI in 1946, and led the party's growth after its post-war legalisation. In 1952 he and Pierre Lambert played a key role in the split in the PCI with a minority composed of co-thinkers of Michel Pablo. In 1954 the Algerian War of Independence escalted. The PCI naturally supported independence. However, Lambert and Bleibtreu started to disagree over tactics in Algeria. Lambert supported the MTLD of Messali Hadj while others, along with Bleibtreu, supported CRUA (the fore-runner of the FLN). Lambert was able to win a majority in 1955, expelling Bleibtreu and its comrades. The expelled group took again the name Goupe Bolchévik-Leninist and publish the review 'Trotskysme '. The GBL later joined the New Left, within which Bleibtreu created the Revolutionary Socialist Tendency, a founder member of the UGS and the PSU. Bleibtreu became a member of the political committee of the PSU, then also its general secretary until he left that party in 1964. Bleibtreu's militancy engaged art as well. He organized in Paris, in 1967, an exhibition named \"Art for Peace to Vietnam\", a method which he would use again, in 1993, in Athens against the embargo in Iraq. Bleibtreu supported the development and the coordination of the 'Base Committees' in 1968, endeavouring to reduce the disagreements between the Trotskyist groups, from where his nickname of \"Jean XXIII of Trotskyism\" comes, following a famous appeal he made in the large lecture theater of the Sorbonne.

On 23 March 2013, following Sato Kilman's resignation, Parliament elected Moana Carcasses Kalosil as Prime Minister. Carcasses appointed Simelum as his Minister for Justice and Social Welfare. In May, Carcasses sacked his Finance Minister, Willie Jimmy, \"amid reports the veteran politician was in talks with the opposition about a possible defection\", which Jimmy denied. Simelum replaced him, while Silas Yatan (Greens MP for Tanna) was given the Justice portfolio. Like other members of the Vanua'aku Pati, he crossed the floor on 15 May 2014 to help bring down the Carcasses government. New Prime Minister Joe Natuman maintained Simelum at his post as Minister for Finance. He lost office on 11 June 2015 when the Natuman government was ousted in a motion of no confidence."

  "text" : "Peterson retired in 1973 after 25 years at the Smithsonian, where he had held the positions of Associate Curator and Curator of the Divisions of Military and Naval History, 1948–1957; Head Curator of the Department of History, 1951–1957; Head Curator and Chairman of the Department of Armed Forces History, 1957–1969; and Curator of the Division of Historic Archaeology, 1969–1973. Among his accomplishments at the Smithsonian, he designed and assembled the Hall of Naval History, which opened on 19 June 1952 with speeches by Rear Adm. John B. Heffernan, United States Navy; Dr. Remington Kellogg, Director of the United States National Museum; and Dr. Alexander Wetmore, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Peterson spent 25 years diving on ancient wrecks throughout the world, but with a focus on the Florida Straits, the West Indies and off the Coast of Bermuda. Detailed articles about his explorations of wrecked galleons appeared in the press of the time. Along with legendary Bermudian treasurer hunter Teddy Tucker and others from the Smithsonian, Peterson is credited with developing the grid system for surveying wreck sites. Peterson also taught marine archaeology at the University of Maryland. Numerous reels of film shot and narrated by Peterson, which detail the surface operations of underwater archaeology, are archived at the Smithsonian. In 1950-51, Peterson visited the wreck of HMS Looe, a 44 gun British frigate wrecked off Looe Key, Florida, in 1744, salvaging, identifying and returning to the Smithsonian a \"variety of recovered ballast blocks, cannons, shots, fasteners, pottery, bottles, and coins.\" In 1955, along with Edwin Link and Marion Link, he retraced the steps of Christopher Columbus in the New World using journal notes and physical descriptions of islands, ultimately reaching the conclusion that Columbus landed first in Caicos Archipelago, not on San Salvador Island, as is widely believed. In the spring of 1958, again with Edwin and Marion Link, Peterson helped to lead an expedition to dig out Caesarea Maritima, an ancient Palestinian harbor built by King Herod in the 1st century B.C. The expedition, using a boat equipped with a powerful water jet to remove sand deposits and strong hoists to bring items to the surface, was thought to be the first of its kind. With his experience of appraising shipwreck finds, Peterson was often asked by the newspapers to provide expert commentary on famous underwater exploration and salvage operations. Peterson is also the author of several books: including History Under the Sea: A Handbook for Underwater Exploration (1969) which is a detailed guide to exploration and identification of coins, cannon and bottles; and \"The Funnel of Gold\"."

Dufek and Antonín Hájek founded The Rangers in 1964. The band was renamed Plavci (Swimmers) in 1971 due to concerns about sharing its name with \"American killers in Vietnam\" (the United States Army Rangers). Band member Radek Tomášek left Plavci in 1973 due to rivalry with Dufek. The band's name reverted to Rangers in 1989. Dufek was the composer of several successful songs. He founded the Nadace Dětské (Children's Heart Foundation) to support treatment for pediatric heart defects. Dufek died in 2005 in a scuba diving accident on the island of San Andrés, Colombia, when he collided with a boat."

When she moved to the Château de Grosbois she came to know the Countess de Guiche, wife of Armand de Gramont, Comte de Guiche. The pair became very good friends and Meurdrac would later dedicate her chemistry treatise to the Countess. It is through this book that Meurdrac's name has survived to the present day and scholars have argued that this was the first work on chemistry by a woman since that of Maria the Jewess in the late classical period."

Her film career was mainly limited to stereotyped roles of \"femme fatale\" or seductress in sentimental melodramas and romantic comedies. Her career on stage was more successful, as Vernati was the prima donna in several successful revues, with the companies of Nino Taranto, Tino Scotti and Fanfulla, among others. In 1947, after her marriage to an Iranian doctor, she followed her husband who for professional reasons had to move to Turkey. Once returned, she resumed her activities in films, theater and radio, and then she retired to private life in the mid-1950s."

  "text" : "Larry \"Max\" McLeary (January 11, 1948 – February 11, 2014) was an umpire in minor and independent league baseball. He began his professional umpiring career in the 1970s, working in the New York–Penn League and Eastern League. He suffered an eye injury in January 1977 that necessitated the removal of his eye. Despite his injury, he returned to umpiring games on the amateur level and, eventually, in professional baseball again. He worked in the independent Frontier League for 10 seasons, becoming the only known one-eyed umpire in professional baseball history. He later became general manager of the Cincinnati Steam. He was the main figure in Mike Shannon's 2004 book Everything Happens in Chillicothe: A Summer in the Frontier League with Max McLeary, the One-Eyed Umpire."

  "text" : "Martha Ellicott Tyson (September 13, 1795 – March 5, 1873) was an Elder of the Quaker Meeting in Baltimore, anti-slavery and women's rights advocate, author of the first biography of Benjamin Banneker, and a founder of Swarthmore College. She was the great-great grandmother of state senator James A. Clark, Jr. (1918-2006). Tyson was born in 1795 to George Ellicott and Elizabeth (Brooke) Ellicott, a well respected family of Maryland Quakers, the Ellicotts. Her grandfather, Andrew Ellicott, founded her birthplace, Ellicott's Mills, along with his brothers. She accounted in her books visiting with chief \"Little Turtle\" in 1807 at the age of twelve. Although she never completed formal schooling past primary education, she was well educated at home and fluent in French. She married Nathan Tyson, whose family was a leading Quaker family in Baltimore, and they raised twelve children. At the age of 35, Tyson was chosen as an Elder of the Baltimore Quaker Meeting. A strong supporter of Quaker and coeducation, Tyson was a key founder, along with Lucretia Mott, Edward Parrish, and Benjamin Hallowell, of Swarthmore College. After a decade pushing for the founding of a coeducation Quaker college, Tyson and her husband hosted a meeting in their home of 30 Quaker leaders from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York. This meeting propelled the movement to start the second coeducation college in the United States. Martha Tyson is also well known for her biographical accounts of the scientist, surveyor, and author Benjamin Banneker. As a free African-American, Banneker was a frequent visitor at Tyson's childhood home. Tyson wrote two biographies of Banneker, Sketch in the Life of Benjamin Banneker, published in 1854, and the more complete biography, Benjamin Banneker: The African-American Astronomer, published in 1884."

  "text" : "Mark Thompson (1812–1875) was an English painter of the Victorian era. He painted many scenes from life in and around Sunderland in the north of England. His paintings of local landmarks such as local castles and dockland scenes are now highly prized and several have been secured for local public galleries. Mark Thompson was born on Wearside in 1812. He was a keen amateur painter as a young man, while working in Sunderland as a general agent. He is believed to have taken instruction from several of the resident artists there. He did not become a professional artist until his late forties, becoming well known as painter of local scenes. Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens was the first local authority museum outside London to be established following the Museums Act of 1846. Its first recorded fine art acquisition was a commission by the Sunderland to Mark Thompson, who was paid 30 guineas to record the opening of the new South Dock in 1850. This may be the first occasion in which a town council anywhere in the United Kingdom commissioned a painting. Thompson moved to nearby Bishopswearmouth where he lived until his death in 1875. Most of Thompson's work arose from commissions from the local landed gentry for whom he executed many fine landscapes and topographical views, often recording the fine period country houses of the area for their owners. Thompson's work was highly prized by his patrons, largely because his style is similar to that of Thomas Sidney Cooper the famous painter of pastoral landscapes. Thompson used gentle, earth-toned palettes, with a natural sense of composition and a light, skilful technique. Thompson exhibited his first works in London through the British Institution in 1865 and 1866, with pastoral landscapes, \"The Trees above' Middleton\" and “Sheep Walk, Cronkley Craggs,Teesdale\"."

  "text" : "Marius Ely Joseph Sestier (8 September 1861 – 8 November 1928) was a French cinematographer. Sestier was best known for his work in Australia, where he shot some of the country's first films. Born in Sauzet, Drôme, Sestier was a pharmacist by profession. He was employed by early filmmakers the Lumière brothers (Auguste and Louis Lumière) to demonstrate their cinématographe abroad. In this capacity he travelled to India in June 1896, where he held a showcase of six short films made by the Lumière brothers at Watson's Hotel, Bombay on 7 July 1896; this was the first time moving pictures had been shown in India. Sestier also shot his own films while in Bombay, but the Lumière brothers rejected these for their catalogue as they were not satisfied with the quality. Sestier had met Australian photographer Henry Walter Barnett while travelling from Europe to India, and after Sestier completed his work in India they travelled to Sydney together. In September 1896 Sestier opened Australia's first cinema, the Salon Lumière in Pitt Street, Sydney. Sestier and Barnett began making their own films, starting with a short film of passengers disembarking from the ship S.S. Brighton in Manly, which was the first film shot and screened in Australia. Sestier and Barnett made approximately 19 films together in Sydney and Melbourne, most notably a film of the 1896 Melbourne Cup horse race. The feature, which consisted of 10 one-minute films shown in chronological order (separate films were required due to limitations of cameras of the time), was premiered at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne on 19 November 1896, with Sestier giving an accompanying lecture. It was covered in the Australian press, including The Age and The Bulletin, and has been cited as Australia's first film production. After his business partnership with Barnett ended Sestier continued to tour Australia, demonstrating the cinématographe and showcasing films until May 1897. After returning to France he went on to become director of the Lumière Patents Company."

  "text" : "Mary 'Ajami (1888−1965) was a feminist and pioneering Arabic-language writer. A Christian, she spent her formative years in Damascus, where she received an education from Irish and Russian missionary schools, before studying nursing at the American University of Beirut in 1906. She was a writer—frequently under the pseudonym of Layla (her mother's name) for fear of reprisals—as well as a poet, journalist and founder of the Damascus Women's Literary Club in 1920. Another of her achievements was the establishment of the literary journal, Al-Arous (The Bride) women's journal in 1910, which ran for eleven years. 'Ajami's successful career was tempered by elements of tragedy in her personal life. For many years, she longed to continue her studies abroad, but her father's death and the outbreak of war prevented her from doing so. Joseph T. Zeidan reminds us that her achievements \"...must be assessed in the light of formidable obstacles she encountered while struggling to keep her journal alive, not least of which were her father's attempts to persuade her to quit.\" She was somewhat of an anomaly for her time, and like her more famous peer May Ziade, Mary 'Ajami never married."

His fascinations lie with the body's ability to move between the mundane and the transcendent. His research also focuses on how the presence of the audience creates a space of attention and extraordinary perception. His work has been presented in the Whitney Biennial in 2014, the Dance Theater Workshop, The Kitchen, MIX: The NY Lesbian and Gay Experimental Film Festival, Diverseworks in Houston, TX, the Flynn Center in Burlington, VT, and internationally in festivals such as ImPuls Tanz in Vienna, Springdance Festival in Utrecht and Touch:2005 in Archangel, Russia. Gutierrez received a 2010 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. May 2016 the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation named Gutierrez a recipient of the Performing Artist Award, a grant \"to empower, invest in and celebrate artists.... intended as deepened investments in the artists’ personal and professional development and future work.\""

  "text" : "Marcelino Crisologo (11 November 1844 - 5 July 1927), also known as Mena Crisologo, was a Filipino politician, poet, writer and playwright. He was known for being one of the representatives for Ilocos Sur in the Malolos Congress and being of one of the signatories of the Malolos Constitution. Born in Vigan City, he became the first governor of Ilocos Sur and he popularized Ilocano art and literature. As a dramatist, he wrote a zarzuela entitled Codigo Municipal. One of his works, Mining wenno Ayat ti Kararwa is comparable to Noli me tangere, a novel by Philippine patriot Jose Rizal. He translated Don Quixote into the Ilocano language as Don Calixtofaro de la Kota Caballero de la Luna. In 1904, Crisologo also took part in the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis, Missouri, United States as one of delegation of governors. He continued writing comedies and zarzuelas and promoting Ilocano art and literature after the end of his term as governor. Being one of the most respected Ilocanos, one of the streets of Vigan City was named after him. The heart of Vigan City, a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the half-kilometer Calle Crisologo or Mena Crisologo Street."

Under Michael Vernon Robinson (born 1956) he did the Lancia Dialogos in 1996, which became the Lancia Thesis production car, and he subsequently became the exterior chief designer of Lancias. The 2002 Fulvia concept was his, under the direction of Flavio Manzoni (born 1965) who in 2010 went to Ferrari as design director. In 2004 Tencone succeeded Michael Vernon Robinson as chief designer, Robinson since then moving to Gruppo Bertone. Around 2009, Tencone was added responsibility for the Maserati and Alfa Romeo designs as well, and was in 2014 holding the position as head of design of Maserati, Alfa Romeo and Lancia automobiles.

Aldrich was a prolific and independent maker of popular films \"who depicted corruption and evil unflinchingly, and pushed limits on violence throughout his career.\" Their early collaboration, the film noir Kiss Me Deadly (1955), was entered into the US National Film Registry in 1999; the unusual editing of the film has been noted by several critics. Luciano's work with Aldrich was recognized by four Academy Award nominations, for Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964), The Flight of the Phoenix (1965), The Dirty Dozen (1967), and The Longest Yard (1974). The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences never recognized Aldrich himself."

  "text" : "Mahlon R. DeLong is an American neurologist and professor at the Medical School of Emory University. His research has advanced the understanding and treatment of Parkinson's disease, dystonia, tremor and other neurological movement disorders. DeLong attended Stanford University (AB 1962), Harvard Medical School (MD 1966), completed his internship at Boston City Hospital and his residency training at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and subsequently joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University. Since 1990, he has been a member of the faculty at Emory University, where he has been the William Patterson Timmie Professor of Neurology since 1993. He is a member of the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiative. In 1968, DeLong began five years of research training in the laboratory of Edward Evarts at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. In 1971, he and Russell T. Richardson did experiments with monkeys to find out first groups of neurons (nucleus basalis), which are involved in the pathogenesis conditioned learning and they revealed the role played by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. At the NIH, DeLong recorded the reactions of single brain cells in a part of the brain called the basal ganglia. At that time, it was known that the basal ganglia were involved in movement, and were the part of the brain most significantly affected in Parkinson’s disease. However, little was known about how the basal ganglia affected movement, or how disease of the basal ganglia caused the movement disorders seen in Parkinson's disease. In meticulous experiments over several years, DeLong measured the firing of specific cells in the basal ganglia of awake monkeys when they performed specific trained movements. Based on this work, and the work of others, DeLong and his colleagues identified a series of separate circuits that connect the basal ganglia with the cerebral cortex and thalamus. These circuits allow parallel processing of emotions, thoughts, and movement. In the 1980s, DeLong and his colleagues began to study monkeys with an experimentally-induced disease much like Parkinson’s disease. He discovered that neurons in a part of the basal ganglia called the subthalamic nucleus were firing excessively, and that destroying (ablating) the subthalamic nucleus greatly improved the symptoms. Shortly thereafter, neurosurgeon Alim-Louis Benabid discovered that the same improvement could be achieved by placing a wire into the subthalamic nucleus, connecting it to a battery and delivering an adjustable high-frequency stimulation to the tip of the wire—a technique called deep brain stimulation. Today, this technique is used to improve symptoms and the quality of life in patients with Parkinson’s disease who are not responding adequately to pharmacologic treatment. Ablation or deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has transformed the lives of many people with Parkinson’s disease. For his work in understanding the circuits connecting the basal ganglia to other parts of the brain, and in applying that knowledge to develop a technique that has eased the suffering of many people with Parkinson’s disease, DeLong was honored in 2014 with the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. The same accomplishments were recognized by his receipt (with Benabid) of the 2014 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award."

  "text" : "Martha Annie Whiteley (11 November 1866 – 24 May 1956) was an English chemist, and one of the inventors of the tear gas used in the First World War. She is identified as one of the Royal Society of Chemistry's 175 Faces of Chemistry. Whiteley was born in 1866 in Hammersmith, London, England, and pursued her education at Kensington High School, London – which was the first school belonging to the Girls' Public Day School Trust, providing affordable day school education for girls – and Royal Holloway College for Women (London), from where she graduated in 1890 with a BSc. Whiteley achieved her doctorate in 1902 from the Royal College of Science (later part of Imperial College), working with Professor Sir William Tilden. Her dissertation was on the preparation and properties of amides and oximes. At the same time, she worked part-time as a science lecturer at St Gabriel's Training College in Camberwell, a college for female teachers. After completion of her doctorate, she was invited by Tilden to join the staff at the College of Science, and was one of only two female professional staff when the college merged with the newly formed Imperial College in 1907. At the Rector's request, in 1912 Whiteley founded the Imperial College Women's Association. Whiteley's life and works are described in a detailed chapter in the 2011 publication on European Women in Chemistry. An earlier biography by Mary R.S. Creese of the University of Kansas was published in 1997 in the American Chemical Society's Bulletin for the History of Chemistry, and references what appears to be an obituary published 40 years previously in the year after Whiteley's death."

She began her studies with William Brymner at the Art Association of Montreal (1909 – 1912). Following study in Paris, May returned to Montreal where she became an Associate of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. During World War I, May was hired to create paintings of women in munitions factories; some of that work is in the Canadian War Museum. In 1920, May was a founding member of the original Beaver Hall Group, which supported the local Montreal art community and organized exhibits of their work. When the group dissolved two years later, May and nine other women artists continued a lasting friendship and working relationship that would later become recognised as the Beaver Hall Group. In 1933, she became a founding member of the Canadian Group of Painters."

In January 1947, the king decided the country should become a constitutional monarchy. He designated a committee to plan this process. This plan was never completed. On August 15, 1947, India became independent. On August 11, 1947, Manipur signed an affiliation agreement with India. On 21 September 1949 the king went to Shillong to discuss constitutional matters with the state of India. India formally annexed Manipur. Maharaja Budhachandra remained as constitutional head of the state government until his death in 1955. He was the last king of Manipur.

  "text" : "Michael Anthony Petrelis (born January 26, 1959) is an American AIDS activist, LGBTQ rights activist, and blogger. He was diagnosed with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in 1985 in New York City, New York. As a member of the Lavender Hill Mob, a forerunner to the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), he was among the first AIDS activists to protest responses to the disease. He was a co-founding member of ACT UP in New York City, New York, and later helped organize ACT UP chapters in Portland, Oregon, Washington, D.C., and New Hampshire, as well as the ACT UP Presidential Project. Petrelis was also a founding member of Queer Nation/National Capital, the Washington D.C. chapter of the militant LGBTQ rights organization. In 1990, he organized a nationwide boycott of products manufactured by Philip Morris Companies, Inc. (now Altria Group, Inc.), including Marlboro cigarettes and Miller beer, to protest the company's support for Jesse Helms, a Republican senator from North Carolina whose rhetoric and policy positions Petrelis said were harmful to LGBTQ communities. Petrelis was among several activists who disclosed, in 1989, that Mark Hatfield, a Republican senator from Oregon who supported anti-gay legislation, was secretly gay, the first such political outing of an elected official by American activists. Over the next few years, Petrelis became an outspoken proponent of outing and one of its most prominent practitioners; at a 1990 press conference on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, he outed a dozen public figures, although no news outlets published the names, and he played a pivotal role in the 1991 outing of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Pete Williams by writer Michelangelo Signorile in The Advocate, an American LGBT-interest magazine. When Terry M. Helvey and an accomplice murdered Helvey's shipmate, U.S. Navy Seaman Allen R. Schindler, Jr. in October 1992, because Schindler was gay, Petrelis traveled twice to Japan to press the Navy for justice on Schindler's behalf and to monitor the trial, while raising awareness of the hate crime in the U.S. After relocating to San Francisco, California, in 1995, Petrelis successfully lobbied the city's Department of Public Health (SFDPH) to make the female condom available to gay men, and advocated reopening the gay bathhouses there. He also founded the AIDS Accountability Project, a watchdog organization that obtained IRS tax forms 990 from nonprofit AIDS service organizations, then published the financial information disclosed therein online. He currently lives with his partner of eighteen years, Mike Merrigan, and writes a blog called The Petrelis Files. On April 5, 2014, Petrelis announced his candidacy for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, running against incumbent Scott Wiener for the District 8 seat, representing the Castro, Noe Valley, Diamond Heights, and Glen Park neighborhoods of San Francisco. In January 1999, Out magazine included Petrelis in the Out 100, recognizing him, for creating the AIDS Accountability Project, as one of the \"people who defined 1998\".In August 1999, The Advocate named Petrelis among its \"Best and Brightest Activists\" citing the AIDS Accountability Project and other controversial causes."

  "text" : "Maximiliano Thous Orts, (b. San Esteban de Pravia, Asturias, 1875 - d. Valencia, 1947), also known as Maximilià Thous i Orts, was a Spanish journalist, writer and filmmaker. Although he was born in Asturias, his family were from Alicante, and when he was small they went to live in Valencia where he grew up. He studied Law at the University of Valencia, but soon gave up his studies to work as a journalist and writer. During his professional career he founded several magazines: El Gladiador, El Guante Blanco (1912–18) and El Sobaquillo. He also worked at El Criterio, El Palleter, and El Correo Valenciano, and managed La Correspondencia de Valencia, which he made the official publication of the political party Unión Valencianista Regional (URV) ; he was also this party's candidate in several municipal elections. In 1901 he won the Flor Natural top prize in the Floral Games. In 1909, together with José Serrano Simeón, he composed the Valencian Anthem, known as the Exhibition Anthem. He wrote many works for the theatre - operettas, farces and comedies. He also worked as a filmmaker. In 1918 he directed the documentary Sanz y el Secreto de Su Arte about the ventriloquist Paco Sanz. From 1923, when Primo de Rivera's regime began, he produced other films: La Bruja, La Dolores, La alegría del batallón and Nit d'albaes. During the Second Spanish Republic he became director of the Valencian Ethnography and Folklore Museum. At the end of the Spanish Civil War the museum was closed down and Thous lost his rights as composer of the anthem, leaving him destitute. After this he wrote only a few unsuccessful booklets. In 1949 he was posthumously honoured by the Lo Rat Penat cultural association."

As a reward, the Sassanian shah Kavadh I appointed him as the marzban of Armenia in 518. According to Samuel Anetsi: \"after the patrician Vard Mamikonian, brother of Vahan, the Persian marzbans ruled Armenia for 11 years. The government of Armenia then passed to Mjej of the Gnuni family, who held it for thirty years\". During this period, Mjej maintained religious peace. In 527, he repelled other Hunnic invasions. In 548, he was succeeded by Gushnasp Bahram."

He graduated from the Warsaw University and completed his PhD thesis in 2008. Urynowicz is the recipient of the United States Holocaust Museum Fellowship. He specializes in World War II history of Poland with special focus on Polish-Jewish relations and the rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust. Urynowicz runs an internet portal called Życie za Życie (Life for a Life) with educational and audio-visual materials as well as online documentaries devoted to the subject. The portal was inaugurated in March 2011 under the auspices of IPN and the National Centre of Culture represented by Anna Chylak. Urynowicz is the author of Holocaust biography titled Adam Czerniaków 1880-1942, about the Warsaw Ghetto leader who committed suicide when ordered by Nazi Germans to participate in the selection of Jews to Treblinka during the Grossaktion Warsaw of 1942. As researcher, Urynowicz has been challenged by two other historians of the IPN who have expressed their concern about some of his methodology in the interpretation of the Holocaust data from the Polish capital. Conversely, Urynowicz insisted that writing about Righteous requires study and no approach based on preconceived notions is acceptable to him.[pg.110]"

After working as a bank clerk for a short period he decided to focus on his acting career in 1893. After working at various theatres in Austria and Germany for about twenty years he was discovered in Berlin as leading man by movie star Asta Nielsen with whom he played in several movies directed by Urban Gad. When Joe May founded his own film production company in 1915 he formed a contract with Max Landa who became the first of a number of actors to play the role of the fictional British detective Joe Deebs, created as a rival to Sherlock Holmes during the silent era. The Jewish Landa and his wife Margot Walter fled Germany following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, and he committed suicide in exile in Yugoslavia."

Dunlavey's speciality in the military was military intelligence, and it was in that capacity that he was appointed the commander of Joint Task Force 170, a position he held from February through November 2002.Dunlavey was the sole commander of JTF 170, a unit created to interrogate individuals held in Guantanamo Bay detention camp, in Cuba. Generals Lehnert and Baccus commanded Joint Task Force 160, a unit created to handle the detention of individuals held in Guantanamo. Dunlavey clashed with his Lehnert and Baccus, claiming they were undermining the efforts of his command through treating them humanely, allowing them to be visited by representatives of the Red Cross, and allowing them to be advised of their rights under the Geneva Conventions. He also clashed with the FBI, when its agents reported JTF 170 was using illegal interrogation techniques.In October 2002 Dunlavey wrote a memo to his superiors, requesting formal authorization to use extended interrogation techniques, that included sleep deprivation, beatings, sensory deprivation and overload. In November 2002 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld created Joint Task Force Guantanamo with the combined responsibilities of both Task Force 160 and Task Force 170, and appointed Geoffrey D. Miller to its command. According to a September 11, 2011, profile in the Erie Times-News, a local paper, Dunlavey has defended the use of these controversial interrogation techniques. In 2004 four United Kingdom citizens sued Dunlavey for his role in their detention.In 2007 Freedom of Information Act requests revealed that Dunlavey told military investigators investigating the use of torture at Guantanamo that his orders came directly from Secretary of Defense Rumseld. In 2011 Dunlavey sent out an email joke, for which he felt he should apologize the next day. Dunlavey announced his intention to retire in May 2012, due to health problem.Dunlavey had been undergoing treatment for after-effects of his service during the 1991 Gulf War since 2002, and had been diagnosed with cancer in the fall of 2011. According to the Erie Times News Dunlavey had been an early advocate of establishing veterans courts.The article compared special veteran's courts to mental health courts."

He won the honor in 2013 in Birmingham, Alabama. As U.S. Mid-Amateur champion, McCoy was invited to the 2014 Masters Tournament. He shot 78-83=161 to miss the cut. McCoy was born in Des Moines, Iowa and his son Nate, also an amateur golfer, currently acts as his caddy. McCoy's ancestors originally came to the United States from Ireland in the early 1900s, settling first in Pennsylvania before moving to Iowa. He claims his love of golf came from his father who he would travel with on occasion back to the hills of South Armagh in Ireland, to visit relatives and sample some of the golf courses around the mountains of Mourne. He played college golf at Wichita State University. Among McCoy's golf honors is also a 2009 Amateur Cup win in Iowa."

It was believed she may have been a victim of the notorious Green River killings, which have an approximate number of 49 victims while she remained a missing person. Gary Ridgway has since pleaded guilty to most of these killings, plus six additional murders. However, Vincent's case has not been officially solved. NCIS cast member Pauley Perrette collaborated with the popular television show America's Most Wanted in 2009 to work on solving the case."
