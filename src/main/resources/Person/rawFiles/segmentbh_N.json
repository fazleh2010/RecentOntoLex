Clark Smith; July 31, 1877 – October 8, 1935) was an important African-American musician, composer, and music educator in the United States during the early decades of the 1900s. Born on the Army base at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, Smith began his music education very early organizing bands in Wichita starting in 1893. His strict military style leadership led to prominence and over the next 30 years he would lead bands in Chicago, Wichita, Kansas City, the Tuskegee Institute, and in St. Louis. He was an important educator for many of the prominent early Jazz musicians from Kansas City, Chicago, and St. Louis. He died in 1935 as the result of a stroke. Many primary documents about Smith's life have been lost as a result of a fire that destroyed most of his personal documents."

Growing up in the apartheid era and seeing the negative portrayal images of black South Africans and the lack of participation of black women in a media industry dominated by white males, this reinvigorated her to want to make change, however it was not an easy dream to fulfil due to race restrictions at the time. Ntsoma attended St Mary's High School where she would be introduced to music, dance and drama, this is where she knew her career path was different from her peers."

He was not able to make himself understood to people around him and his behavior was considered erratic. Despite his disability, Higashida quickly took to learning Japanese characters. By attending a nearby cram school, he was able to better express himself. Soon he began writing Japanese characters with the help of adults who assisted by guiding his hand. He was able to express some of his emotions. Higashida’s mother noticed his power of expression and encouraged him to write poems and short stories.At the age of 11, and again when he was 12, Higashida won first prize in the Grimm Fairy Tales Contest, a story writing competition. Since 2004, Higashida has published more than twenty books of fiction and non-fiction. The Reason I Jump was published as a book in 2007 featuring 58 often-asked questions about his autism and his frank, sometimes startling, answers to them. The book was a hit in Japan, but its discovery and subsequent translation by David Mitchell, who previously lived in Japan and has a Japanese wife, brought it mainstream to audiences all around the world. Mitchell’s English translation was published in 2013 and soon topped the best-seller list of Amazon’s U.S. and British sites."

  "text" : "Nicola Consoni (Ceprano in the Province of Frosinone, in the region of Lazio, 1814 - Rome, 1884) was an Italian painter, mainly of sacred and historic subjects. In Perugia, he was a pupil of Giovanni Sanguinetti at the Academy, but then moved to Rome, and joined the studio of Tommaso Minardi, and later Pio Joris. In Rome, he was commissioned by Pope Pius IX to fresco some of the second story loggias of the Vatican Palace and the Vatican library. The frescoes depict scenes from the New Testament. He also designed the mosaics, made in deliberately primitive early Christian style for the facade of the rebuilt Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. He painted some of the frescoes in the central nave. He completed some restorations including frescoes by Raphael in the church of San Severo of Perugia. He also helped restore mosaics in the apse of Basilica of San Giovanni Laterano. He also received commissions from Queen Victoria to paint the altarpiece, depicting The Resurrection, and pendentives with the Evangelists in her Royal Mausoleum at Frogmore at the Home Park, Windsor. It was all completed in a Neoclassical style recalling Raphael. He had a commission from Monsignor Josip Juraj Strossmayer, bishop of Diakovar (1849-1905), to paint a Christ and an Immaculate Conception for his Cathedral, now in Croatia. For many years, he lived in the Palazzo Campanari in the Rione of Ripetta, Rome. Consoni was awarded the Order of the Crown of Italy and the Order of Saint Stephen. He became honorary member of many artistic societies and was once president of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome."

  "text" : "Norman Lloyd (November 8, 1909 – July 31, 1980) was an American pianist, composer, educator, author and supporter of the arts who scored works for modern dance, documentary film  and classical chamber. He exerted tremendous influence as an educator, notably at Juilliard where he transformed the teaching of musical theory; and later as the author of books including the popular \"Fundamentals of Sight Singing and Ear Training\" (co-authored with Arnold Fish). He continued to influence and champion the arts as creator of the Rockefeller Foundation's arts program and its first director. He was the son of David Lloyd, a steel mill worker and minor league baseball player, and grandson of William Lloyd, a coal miner who immigrated to the United States from Wales in 1845. His professional career began as an 11-year-old piano accompanist for silent films in the early 1920s. He received both his bachelor's and master's degrees from NYU, where he studied musical composition under Aaron Copland. It was also at NYU that Lloyd met fellow piano accompanist Ruth Dorothy Rohrbacher, whom he married in 1933 and with whom he collaborated on books and musical projects throughout his life. They had two sons, David and Alex. In the mid-1930s, Lloyd was hired to work as a pianist and composer in the newly created summer dance program at Bennington College, alongside legendary choreographers Martha Graham, Jose Limon, Doris Humphrey and others. During the summers at Bennington, he scored many enduring works for dance, including \"Panorama\" for Graham and \"Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias\" with Humphrey choreographing for Limon. The Bennington collaboration of artists during those years is considered by many to be the foundation of modern dance as an American art form. Lloyd went on to serve as Director of Education at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City from 1946 to 1949, where he established a new dance division with Martha Hill as director, and invited Graham, Limon and other Bennington choreographers to join the faculty. During this period, he and Juilliard president William Schuman designed a new and innovative approach to the study of musical theory entitled, \"The Literature and Materials of Music,\" which shifted the emphasis away from textbooks and rigorous ear training to discussion and direct pedagogy by composers in the classroom. He and Schuman were committed to teaching music from a more holistic approach that would \"make responsible adults of musicians.\"  The new curriculum was intended to disrupt what the two men considered to be an overly insular culture and rigidly formal training regimen at Juilliard, and effectively altered the course of American musical education towards the more comprehensive and progressive path on which it remains today. Lloyd also continued to compose works for leading choreographers, including Jose Limon's 1947 work, \"La Malinche,\" as well as chamber works for the piano  and violin. He worked tirelessly as a teacher and educator and his influence can be felt in the works of the many students  who passed through Juilliard during his tenure. He eventually left Juilliard in 1963 to serve as Dean of the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music; he received a Doctorate of Music from the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music the same year. In 1965, he left Oberlin to create the Rockefeller Foundation's arts program, serving there as Director of Arts Programming until 1972. He published a number of books during his career, including the beautifully written and illustrated \"Golden Encyclopedia of Music,\" \"Fireside Book of Favorite American Songs\" and \"Fireside Book of Folk Songs.\" He played a pivotal role in the re-emergence and popularity of Scott Joplin's ragtime tunes some 30 years after the Depression when he persuaded Vera Brodsky Lawrence to edit, \"The Complete Works of Scott Joplin.\" Lloyd died of leukemia at his home in Greenwich, CT in 1980. His legacy is a varied one, with his impact felt in diverse aspects of the arts over four decades. His overall impact on American music is considerable, though, and continues to resonate today."

Assaad began his career in politics in the late 1960s when he became a leading figure within the Communist Labor Organization, and later joined forces with the Palestine Liberation Organization against the Israeli occupation. Following his resistance against Israel, Assaad fled Lebanon to France in 1982 aboard the ship that was also carrying the leaders of the PLO. Assaad wrote for Al-Mustaqbal newspaper from 1998 to 2000, and then wrote for Al-Safir newspaper from 2000 to 2001. He returned to Al-Mustaqbal in 2004 to become its editor-in-chief and served in that capacity until 2010. The next year, he joined Al-Joumhouriah newspaper.Assaad helped establish the March 14 coalition’s secretariat in 2008 and held the position of the Future Movement’s Cultural Affairs coordinator and was a member of the movement’s executive office until his death. Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri mourned the passing of Assaad, whom he called an “essential pillar of the Future Movement, the independence uprising and March 14.” \"I mourn with deepest sadness and sorrow the passing away of an essential pillar of the Future Movement, the independence uprising and the March 14 coalition,\" Hariri said in a statement. \"I extend my deepest condolences to his wife, children, the Asaad family and the people of the south,\" he added.Hariri also said that in Asaad’s death Lebanon lost a figure of justice and freedom.\"He has supported the path of independence, sovereignty, truth and national peace with unrelenting determination,\" Hariri added.A statement by the March 14 coalition’s secretariat also mourned Assaad’s death, saying that he was \"brave enough to exercise self-criticism regarding Lebanon’s war and he was the first to point out the brutality of that war and its repercussions on the society.\"“He was not only one of the founders of the Cedar Revolution, but he was one of the toughest and most responsible figures,” the statement added.Funeral services for Assaad will be held in his hometown of Sidon Monday. For its part, the National Liberal Party mourned Asaad’s death and praised his involvement in the Cedar Revolution as well as the March 14 coalition. “The death of Nassir al-Assaad is a loss to Lebanese thought and the nation ... his words will remain as a beacon of freedom in this unhappy East,” said a statement released by the National Liberal Party. Nassir al-Assaad died of a heart attack 26/5/2012, He was 61."

Delien, often referred to in the media as \"The real life Sleeping Beauty\", is a United States Pennsylvania resident that was diagnosed with Kleine–Levin Syndrome (KLS) when she was six-and-a-half years old. A doctor at Allegheny General Hospital was the one who was finally able to identify Nicole’s symptoms. In 2012, at 17 years old, Delien started to bring awareness to KLS by appearing in a number of media events to provide a real-life example of the syndrome. The syndrome causes Delien to sleep for 18–19 hours a day on average and to sleep for longer stretches of time as well, including a 64-day block of time in 2012. The disorder is characterized by episodic periods of hypersomnia and lethargy. These episodes can last anywhere from days to weeks and can last in the patient from eight to twelve years before disappearing altogether. Delien's parents and siblings do not suffer from the disorder. KLS has caused Delien to miss many family holidays and celebrations, including Thanksgiving and Christmas. After winning tickets to a Katy Perry concert, Delien was unable to attend because of an episode. Upon hearing about Delien, Perry arranged for a meeting backstage after a performance at a subsequent show in nearby Connecticut. Delien has appeared on CBS news, The TODAY Show, the Jeff Probst Show, ABC Primetime Medical Mysteries, WPXI News, WTAE News, and other media outlets."

He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1948 after taking politics courses. From 1948 to 1981 Amaya worked for the MITI. He served as the deputy minister from 1979 to 1981. Andrew Pollack of The New York Times stated that Amaya \"was particularly noted for\" his development of the MITI vision in moving Japanese industry from heavy industry to electronics and knowledge-oriented industries. Pollack added that Amaya \"was instrumental in drawing up plans by which the Government aided the development of Japanese industry.\" In 1979, in order to resolve a trade dispute with the U.S. government, Amaya introduced voluntary export controls on automobiles. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune stated that after Amaya's retirement from the MITI, he \"went on to become one of Japan's best-known commentators on economic issues.\" He became the executive director of the Dentsu Institute for Human Studies in 1987. He later became the chairperson and chief executive. He also served as a president of the Japan Economic Foundation (JEF). According to the MITI he died of lung cancer on Tuesday August 30, 1994 at age 68. His death occurred in Tokyo. The following day would have been his 69th birthday."

  "text" : "Nicholas Laurence Joseph Browne (born 24 March 1991 in Leytonstone) is an English cricketer who plays for Essex as a left-handed batsman who bowls leg breaks. He studied at Trinity Catholic High School, Woodford Green, and has played for South Woodford CC since childhood, progressing from their youth teams into their 1st XI. He played for a number of seasons for Essex's 2nd XI, scoring over a 1000 runs for the Essex 2nd XI that year and eventually this led to his call up to the first team. Making his first-class debut in May 2013 against Worcestershire, he scored 3 and took 0-59 in a rain effected draw. Browne scored his maiden first-class fifty in June 2014 in a County Championship game against Gloucestershire. He scored 65 in a partnership of 139 with fellow opener Tom Westley. His maiden First-Class century came the following week against Derbyshire at Chesterfield, when he was unbeaten on 132*, the highest score ever made by an Essex opener carrying his bat. In the second innings scored 100* to become the first Essex player since Ravi Bopara in 2010 to score a century in both innings of a match. He spent every minute of the match on the pitch. In the final fixture of the 2014 season he scored 118 against Worcestershire at Chelmsford. At the Kia Oval on 27 April 2015 Browne made his highest First Class score to date, scoring 143 against Surrey. In a County Championship match versus Lancashire at Old Trafford on 9 July he scored 105 in the first innings, and 50 in the second innings as Essex were made to follow on. He continued his run of good form with his sixth Championship century against Glamorgan making 129 in an opening stand of 237 with Liam Dawson at Chelmsford on 14 July 2015. The following day he was awarded his County Cap during the lunch interval. Browne became the first Essex player to reach 1,000 First-Class runs in a season since Bopara achieved the feat in 2008. He brought up the milestone on day four of the match against Leicestershire during a career best knock of 151* in the second innings. He continued his fine form the following winter playing 1st grade cricket in Australia for Mosman CC, scoring a double century (206) that beat the previous highest score by an English batsman in 1st grade cricket, but fell just short of breaking the Australian record of 210 in a 1st grade game. Upon his return to county cricket in 2016 he struck 87 in the first innings against Cambridge University followed by 100 in the second innings. In the first county division 2 game of the season he helped Essex to a 10-wicket win over Gloucestershire with a second innings 55* not out. In the Championship match versus Derbyshire in May 2016, he scored his maiden first class double century, finally falling for 255."

  "text" : "Nicasio Pajarito Gonzalez (born October 13, 1935) is a Mexican potter from Tonalá, Jalisco known for his canelo ware. Pajarito Gonzalez has worked with clay most of his life, with a career of over fifty years. He works in the regional styles of bruñido and canelo, but is particularly renowned for the latter. He continues to run his own workshop with his children Zenón and Isabel, who learned the craft from him, producing platters, large covered jars called tibores, jugs, dispensers in the form of bulls and horses. The last are unique to the workshop. The pieces are mostly made of a mix of white clay from a town called Rosario and black clay from Tateposco, mixed in equal proportions, as well as red clay from various sources. The children do most of the prep work, cleaning, mixing and wetting the clay for molding and modeling, which includes working out the air bubbles by stomping it with the feet. Complicated pieces are made with a mixture of molding and modeling, smoothing the junctures with a stone. The piece is covered in a reddish clay slip and set out to dry and then this process is repeated. Pajarito Gonzalez considers to the mix of clays to be reflective of Mexico’s mestizo heritage. The pieces are decorated with earth colors generally with an overall tone of cinnamon to reddish after firing. The Pajarito family creates its own paints using the same clay as the pieces, sometimes adding other mineral pigments. They also create their own brushes from the hair of various animals. The larger decorative elements are painted first, with the details added over top. Many of these designs are unique to the family and include flowers, fretwork and palm leaves. When dry, the colors are set by burnishing the piece with great force, which also seals the pores. Then the piece is fired in a wood kiln for three hours to obtain the overall cinnamon color and shine. This technique of burnishing and firing only once is reminiscent of pre Hispanic pottery. He has exhibited his work at the Museo Nacional de la Cerámica in Tonalá and received various awards in both Mexico and abroad including the 2002 Galardón Presidencial of the Premio Nacional de la Cerámica in Tlaquepaque. In 2001, he was named a “grand master” by the Fomento Cultural Banamex. In 2012, he joined with other noted Tonalá artisans to found the Tesoros del Arte Tonalteca Gallery in the town."

Piera was born in Santo Domingo to immigrants from Spain: her mother was Basque and her father was Catalan. Piera was orphaned at 10 years old when her father, journalist José Enrique Piera Puig, was killed in 1970 by the authoritarian regime of Joaquín Balaguer. Nuria married journalist and broadcaster Pablo McKinney, from whose union was born Nuria’s only daughter, Leslie Paola McKinney. In September 2013, a news investigation led by Piera revealed that the Papal Nuncio of Santo Domingo, Józef Wesołowski, whom Pope Francis had dismissed, was not removed from office due to a dispute he held for three years with Puerto Rican Cardinal Roberto González Nieves, as stated in the Italian and Dominican press and as insinuated by the archbishop of Santo Domingo Cardinal Nicolás de Jesús López Rodríguez, but instead due to the consumption of alcoholic beverages in areas of dubious reputation and abuse of children and adolescent males, This emerged as another scandal of pederasty in the Catholic Church. In 2014, EFE listed her as one of the most influential women in Ibero-America."

She earned her master's degree at the University of Paris in 1965 and 1966. She later studied giant otters in South America. In one year of this study, she managed to identify 249 different animals. She also helped Suriname officials learn how to preserve river otters, though they still face endangerment today. She returned to the University of Paris to complete her PhD. Her 1980 dissertation concerned a colony of river otters on Suriname's Kapoeri Creek. She also worked as a fund-raiser and speaker for the World Wildlife Fund. She was briefly married to a commodities broker, but divorced him in 1974. Most recently, she has settled in Oregon and is a senior lecturer at Oregon State University."

  "text" : "Nelly Kaplan (born 11 April 1936 in Buenos Aires) is an Argentine-born French writer who focuses on the arts, film and filmmakers. She studied economics at the University of Buenos Aires. Passionate about cinema, she abruptly put her studies on hold to go to Paris to represent the new Argentine film archive at an international convention and later became a correspondent for different Argentine newspapers. She met Abel Gance in 1954, who gave her the opportunity to work on the film La tour de Nesle. She became his assistant during the film and showed the program Magirama (triple screen) in Polyvision, then, still at Abel Gance's side, she collaborated with him on Austerlitz. He trusted her with the direction of all the second crew's action scenes during the filming of his movie Cyrano et d'Artagnan. Meanwhile, she published her work about Magirama under the name Le Manifeste d'un art nouveau, with a preface by Philippe Soupault. In 1960, she published a film report entitled Le Sunlight of Austerlitz, through the Plon publishing house. Starting in 1961, she directed an entire series of art shorts, which won numerous prizes in various international festivals. Among these shorts were \"Gustave Moreau,\" a brilliant analysis of a genius painter at the origin of essentially all modern art; \"Rudolphe Bresdin,\" the engraver; \"Dessins et merveilles,\" on the sketchbooks of Victor Hugo, as well as \"Les années 25 \", \" La Nouvelle Orangerie \" ; \"Abel Gance hier et demain \", \" A la source, la femme aimée \", titles based on the secret notebooks of the painter André Masson."

  "text" : "Nathan Greno is an American film director, story artist and writer at Walt Disney Animation Studios. He is best known as the co-director of the 2010 animated film Tangled. Inspired by Disney films since the first grade, Greno started as a young boy writing and drawing comic books and strips. In 1996, during his junior year at Columbus College of Art and Design, he was hired by Walt Disney Feature Animation. He started there as an animation cleaner on Mulan (1998). Being creatively unfulfilled, he switched to story development. He then contributed as a story artist on Brother Bear (2003), wrote a screenplay and worked as a story artist on Meet the Robinsons (2007), and supervised the story on Bolt (2008). With the short film Super Rhino (2009), he made his directorial debut. In 2006, he took over a long-in-development project Tangled, and chose Byron Howard, with whom he had collaborated on Bolt and Super Rhino, as a directing partner. The film was released in 2010 to a great critical and financial reception, and was followed in 2012 by Greno and Howard-directed short film Tangled Ever After. Greno is directing an animated film, titled Gigantic. Loosely based on the fairy tale of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", the film is scheduled for a 2018 release."

  "text" : "Nicholas Gardiner Macdonald (born October 22, 1944) is an American author and filmmaker (as Nick Macdonald) who made several independent films during the 1970s, including Break Out! (1971) and The Liberal War (1974). His book In Search of «La Grande Illusion»: a Critical Appreciation of Jean Renoir's Elusive Masterpiece was published in November 2013. Macdonald's anti-Vietnam War film, The Liberal War, is set in a utopian, anarchist future, looking back critically on the John F. Kennedy administration's prosecution of the war in Vietnam. Contrary to the belief held by many that JFK intended to decrease American military involvement in Southeast Asia at the time of his assassination, The Liberal War argues that he had every intention of continuing his expansion of the conflict in Vietnam. The Liberal War was acquired for the Study Collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in 1976. His films have been shown in New York City at Film Forum, Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Brooklyn Academy of Music and many independent forums and universities. Macdonald lives in Brooklyn, New York, and is the son of American writer and critic Dwight Macdonald."

  "text" : "Nina Murdoch (born 1970) is a British painter, winner of the first Threadneedle Prize in 2008. Murdoch graduated from the Slade School of Art followed by a postgraduate diploma at the Royal Academy of Arts, London. She paints on large canvases using egg tempera on gesso, with a subject matter normally drawn from visits to the streets of South London. Each painting can be made of up to 100 layers of medium, added then scraped back, which restricts her output to between 8 and 10 paintings per year. In 2008 she was winner of the inaugural Threadneedle Prize for figurative art, winning £25,000 for her Untitled painting of light on a pavement. In 2010 she joined the list of artists represented by Marlborough Fine Art, London."

  "text" : "Neville Buchanan (born 17 October 1959) is a stop motion animator and director based in England. His style is informed by his mentor Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad) His work has been likened to Harryhausen's predecessor Willis O'Brien (King Kong) with its emphasis on meticulously detailed puppets sculpted onto armatures forwarding the narrative. Buchanan met Harryhausen as a youth while the master was at work on the original Clash of the Titans, and eventually became a set of extra hands and eyes on that set and subsequent projects. This tutelage sped along a career in 2D & 3D animation, special effects, armature construction, production design, storyboarding, sculpting, miniatures and TV/film production crews in the UK & Wales. Buchanan's homage to this iconic art form is reflected in his own short films & series, Omni Force, The Ultra Guardians, and his online digital content. His projects profess his own space opera leanings, with grotesque creatures and heroic black, female, hybrid and cyborg characters driving the story—arrayed against conglomerates epitomizing villainy. Use of hands-on miniature detail and expressive puppet nuances also figure in his work. He has been the subject of numerous interviews in animation journals and publications and is considered part of an exclusive tier of premier animators in his field. He was given reign by Clive Barker to design and fabricate a quadruped creature with rider for the film Nightbreed. Buchanan's work can also be seen in the BBC series Space Odyssey: Voyage To The Planets."

  "text" : "Nati Kaji or Natikaji or Nati Kaji Shrestha (1925–2003) was veteran singer, musician of Nepali music industry. More than 3 score years ago the Nepali music industry was a near abyss, devoid of the most integral character, its own individuality. From 1950 (2007 BS), this flaw was in the course of elimination when Nati Kaji was introduced to the music scene. He was one of the few pioneers of this field who, with their folk-based contemporary music, crafted a musical revolution by urging the people to repudiate the then popular Hindi music and enjoy their own design. \" ...ajai ra raati k dekhen sapana mai marigayeko...\" It's songs like these that captured the hearts of the numerous listeners and launched Nati Kaji to the peak on which he is today. He has been rightfully credited for immortal numbers like 'yo Nepali shir uchali', which have the might to evoke an entire nation, songs like 'sapana bhulai saara', which demonstrate the angst of a broken heart, and then there are songs such as 'timilai hasera bida matra diyisakethen', which exhibit the despair of separation. Other eminent numbers are 'fulako thunga', 'hridaya bhari ko mero', 'yesto pani hudoraichha', 'para laijau fulaharu', 'rani talau kinara', etc. Natikaji was a nickname given to Amrit Lal Shrestha by his grandparents, but this nickname is the one he is known by throughout the country. He was born in 1925 (1982 BS) at Pulchowk, Lalitpur. He lost his mother at the age of 5 and his father at the age of 10 and so fate had him raised by his grandparents at Gujeshwori where his grandfather was the temple priest. The environment in which one grows up has a massive role to play in what one becomes in life. Similarly, Nati Kaji commenced his musical venture at the fragile age of 7 when he started playing the harmonium at the Gujeshwori Bhajan Mandali. His professional music career, however, initiated when he joined Radio Nepal in 1950 (2007 BS). This was where he laid the foundation for modern music in Nepal through his eternal numbers like 'Pahada Basi', 'Euta tara danda wari', 'Fulai fula fulana dharti', etc. He is now well known as a singer, lyricist and above all, a musician. During the 40 years of his service in Radio Nepal, he composed over 2000 songs of varied genres: patriotic songs, love songs, bhajans and so on. He is also credited for the music of over 15 operas such as Pijada ko Suga, Kunjani, Prithvi Narayan Shah ka Char Pakchhya, etc. Hundreds of his compositions are yet not recorded in Radio Nepal. This shows the substantial magnitude of his creations. He might also be the one such composer who gave music to songs of the highest number of singers and lyricists of older and younger generations alike. The artists include Narayan Gopal, Tara Devi, Meera Rana, Gyanu Rana, Aruna Lama, Mala Sinha, Urmila Shrestha, Nirmala Shrestha, Kamala Shrestha, Gauri KC, Bhuvan Chand, Prem Dhoj Pradhan, Fatteman Rajbhandari, Ruby Joshi, Yogesh Vaidya, Pushpa Nepali, Bacchu Kailash Basnet, C.P. Lohani, Deep Shrestha, Manik Ratna, Indra Narayan, P.L. Shrestha, Panna Kaji, Shiva Shanker, Ramesh Tamrakar, Bharati Upadhyaya, Sangita Shakya, Yam Baral, Ram Krishna Dhakal, Ananda Karki, Rajesh Payal Rai, Pradeep Raj Pandey, Sangita Pradhan, Lochan Bhattarai, Devika Pradhan, Anjan Shakya and many others. As an accolade to his contributions, he has been bestowed with hundreds of awards, which include Gorkha Dakshin Bahu Pratham, Indra Rajya Laxmi Pragya Puraskar, Chinnalata Geet Puraskar and Bhupal Sangeet Puraskaramong many others. \"...euta tara jharda pani aakash singai ritto lagchha...\" At the descent of a star, the whole sky seems vacant... indeed the very aftermath ensued the demise of the legendary musician Nati Kaji Shrestha in 2003 (2060 BS), as if the contemporary Nepali music had lost its foundation, abandoning it in an adhering reverie. That event had left merely memories, which would not resolve anything unless fortified and elicited to serve as the proxy radiance in the darkness of the night sky. As a consequence of assembling those sheer memoirs together, a guild was formed, the 'Nati Kaji Memorial Society', encompassing a number of prominent musicians, litterateurs and singers, who, through their genuine efforts, have kept alive the flamboyance of the prodigy till date. In a chaste effort to revivify the perpetual music composed by Nati Kaji Shrestha, the society has been conducting felicitation programs and concerts every year, each time assembling a group of artists old and new who, in their own way, exhibit popular songs composed by the Nati Kaji. It has also been granting awards to legendary and promising artists involved in the Nepali folk, classical and modern music sector in Nepal. Other feats of the society include the Rs. 5 stamp with Nati Kaji, a website in his name and a junction named after him. This association is relentlessly striving to keep his memory alive, the memory of a maestro..."

In 1816, he was among the founders of the Union of Salvation, a secret society. In 1820, he spoke out for republican government in the Union of Welfare. After the Union of Welfare's 1821 dissolution, Muravyov joined the supreme duma and was a leader in the Northern Society, and was elected to the Southern Society's directory. He wrote a draft constitution for a Russian state, and a tract \"Curious Conversation\" arguing the need to rise against despotism. He was on leave in the country when the Decembrist revolt occurred on 14 December 1825, and did not participate directly in it. But he was complicit, arrested and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress. He was condemned to death, but the sentence was commuted to 20 years of hard labor. He was assigned to the Nerchinsk Mines, then in 1835 exiled to Irkutsk Province where he died in 1843."

With 250 hours in her logbook, she accepted an offer from a friend to obtain her Gulfstream II rating and was certified shortly thereafter. After Marcinko started calling herself \"Gulfstream Girl\", the Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. filed a trademark infringement suit (Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation v. Aviloop LLC et al.) against her on November 18, 2013, alleging that Marcinko had unlawfully appropriated its signature \"Gulfstream\" trademark to promote her company Aviloop. Marcinko and Gulfstream reached an out of court settlement filed on January 6, 2014 after Marcinko changed her online name to Global Girl. Now using the name \"Global Girl\", Marcinko promotes aviation on social media. \"I believe a career in a tech field is the best-kept secret for girls. Aside from the increased job security, there is also a unique sense of accomplishment that comes with succeeding in a male-dominated field.\""

Crow at Moulton, then spent one year in the medical department of the University of Alabama and later attended the medical department of Vanderbilt University, where he earned an M.D. in 1886. Upon getting his degree, Barrett began practicing in Danville, Alabama. There, he served as president as the Morgan County Medical Society and also as chairman of the county democratic executive committee. In 1891, he moved to East Lake, which was at that time not a part of Birmingham. There, he built a large and lucrative practice. Barrett was active in the incorporation of East Lake as a municipality and served as its first and last mayor. East Lake adopted the code form of municipal government in 1910 during Barrett's last term as mayor. Barrett was elected president of the Birmingham Commission (a position equivalent to that of a mayor) in 1917 after a hotly contested race against George B. Ward, the incumbent. As head of the city's finance department, he brought the city's expenditures within its income. He also served as a member of the Jefferson County democratic committee. He was a member of the Knights Templar, the Shrine, Knights of Pythias, and the Junior Order of United American Mechanics. He was a Baptist and was active in church affairs. He married Annie P.

  "text" : "Nancy LeMay (born May 3, 1936) is an American car enthusiast and collector. Nancy met Harold LeMay in the early 1960s, and they were married in 1963; between them they had eight children. One thing Nancy and Harold bonded over was their collections. This included hundreds of vintage cars, but also a great deal of Americana, from toys to signs to dental equipment. While Harold is often cited as the collector of the family, Nancy was just as passionate about it as him. She even got her commercial driver's license endorsement, in case it was needed for some of the larger vehicles in their collection. Harold and Nancy started the Annual LeMay Car Show in the late 1970s. Then, it was a small gathering of family friends. In the decades since then, Nancy has continued to host the show as it has grown into a much-anticipated annual event, drawing thousands of people each year. By 1998, the LeMay family collection was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the “Largest Antique & Vintage Vehicle Collection.\" At that point, the collection held more than 1,900 vehicles. Harold lived just past his 81st birthday, passing away in 2000. By then, the couple’s collection was estimated to have over 3,000 cars. After Harold’s death, Nancy continued to build and maintain their collections. At one point, Harold had hoped to have a museum for his cars so that the public could view them and the collection wouldn’t be broken up after his death. For more than a decade, Nancy LeMay and her family worked to fundraise and build support to open the LeMay - America’s Car Museum in downtown Tacoma. Though cars from a number of collections are displayed, Nancy sits on the board for the museum and the LeMay family has donated hundreds of cars to America’s Car Museum. The LeMay Family Collection Foundation  is a non-profit started by Nancy LeMay and family in 2010. Directly owned and overseen by the family, this museum houses over 500 cars in 3 buildings and is open to the public for tours 6 days a week. This collection is housed at historic Marymount in Tacoma, Washington. Nancy has been active in the community in a variety of other ways; she donated $100,000 to Pierce County Parks and Recreation to build the Harold LeMay Skatepark at Sprinker Recreation Center.On May 28, 2011, Harold and Nancy LeMay were inducted into the Washington State Hot Rod Hall of Fame.In 2013, Nancy was a recipient of the Lee Iacocca Award, given to honor “a person who, over time, has demonstrated an extraordinary dedication to the classic car hobby through vehicle preservation, club participation, and one who has unselfishly assisted and encouraged others in perpetuating an ‘American Automotive Tradition.’”"

Under the influence and guidance of Victor Charlie, a Kachina doll carver, and his wife, a potter, Lena (Blue Corn) Charlie, David’s interest in art was stimulated at an early age. His grandparents were invited to exhibit their art at the Santa Fe Indian Village pavilion at the Railroad Fair in Chicago in 1948. The following year they brought their grandson, 5 ½ year old David, along with them.David was self-taught as an artist. His art teacher in eight grade was Fred Kabotie. After graduation, David attended High school in distant Phoenix. He sold his first Kachina doll while a high school freshman to Byron Hunter, who managed the trading store in Polacca. He saw the young man’s talent in art and as his mentor encouraged him. Hunter bought many of David’s drawings, paintings, and Kachina carvings and sold them through McGee’s trading store.David and his wife Dealva, have three sons and a daughter. David lives and continues to create his painting and carving on the Hopi Reservation in Polacca on First Mesa, Arizona."

He was one of two Ukrainian guards (along with Ivan Marchenko) in charge of the motor that produced the exhaust fumes which were fed through pipes into the gas chambers during the killing process. Shalayev was tried in the Soviet Union after the war, and sentenced to death in 1951 for treason. On 3 May 1951 he gave testimony to his KGB interrogators about the gassing at Treblinka. In an attempt to defuse the sheer enormity of his crimes he kept pointing his finger at the Jews from the Sonderkommando \"helping him\". Both Shalayev and Marczenko (known to his victims from Treblinka as \"Ivan the Terrible\") were sent by the SS to Trieste, Italy after Treblinka was closed, where they participated in the murder of prisoners at the Risiera di San Sabba concentration camp before the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945."

  "text" : "Nathaniel \"Nat\" Muir (born 12 March 1958) from Salsburgh North Lanarkshire is a Scottish retired long-distance runner. He competed at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships on ten occasions, four times as a junior from 1974 to 1977 and six times as a senior between 1978 and 1987. Muir took up athletics in 1970 while at primary school in Chapelhall. He was encouraged by his fellow pupils to join the Shettleston Harriers running club, and his first race was the Lanarkshire Relays in 1970, which saw him earn the fastest individual time in his age group. His career has seen some ups and downs and has been described as, \"One of Scotland's best ever distance runners: possibly also one of the country's unluckiest in that he never had the success at the very topmost level that his ability and dedication deserved\". Muir ran in many competitions throughout his career from his humble beginnings in 1970 spanning over twenty years, with some notable successes such as his 5th win at the 1984 Irvine Beach Park with his last race concluding in 1992-93 season on the Glasgow-Edinburgh run where his team came in 7th with a recurring Achilles tendon injury. Nat himself knew that with the injury his time had come to retire, a decision not brought on by team performance but by his knowledge of his personal limitations to his own fitness and a previous race the Allan Scally Relay as a gauge for the upcoming Glasgow-Edinburgh run. He reflected that \"athletics is essentially an individual sport with a team element coming second to that. No one can gainsay that\"."

She taught in Philadelphia public schools, becoming a principal in 1935 and serving until her retirement in 1952. She inspired generations of students. During the 1920s she was part of a literary group known as the Black Opals. Together with Arthur Fauset, in 1927-1928, she co-edited Black Opals, a literary magazine named after a line from a poem in its first issue. The magazine was considered part of the larger artistic world of the Harlem Renaissance, although it was published in Philadelphia. Similar literary groups and magazines sprang up in Boston and Washington, DC. Born in Savannah, Georgia, to parents who were college graduates and professionals, Bright as a child moved with her family to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the early 1910s, years of the Great Migration. Her father was an Episcopal priest and her mother a social worker. Bright completed most of her education in Philadelphia, graduating from the University of Pennsylvania. She devoted most of her life to her students, as a teacher and a principal."

  "text" : "Neil Wighton Naismith, PhC MPS FSHP AM (13 November 1935 – 26 May 2002), was an Australian pharmacist whose career in hospital pharmacy commenced in 1960. He served as Director of Pharmacy at The Royal Melbourne Hospital from 1967–1997. Naismith introduced innovative changes to hospital pharmacy practice that provided a foundation for services that are now widely established. Neil Naismith implemented new drug distribution systems and presented a paper at the 1969 Federal Conference of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia (SHPA), entitled A New Look at Hospital Packaging, which provided a stimulus for changes to the methods of purchasing and packaging used by hospital pharmacies. Neil was awarded the Allen and Hanbury Medal of Merit in 1975 in recognition of his work in promoting the concepts of unit dose and unit dose packaging. In 1972, Naismith's service to the advancement of pharmacy practice was also recognised by the Churchill Trust with the award of a Churchill Fellowship, and he was the first Australian hospital pharmacist to receive this award. Naismith established the first formalised drug information service in Australia at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and undertook cost-effectiveness studies to demonstrate the value of ward pharmacy services and the role of full-time ward pharmacists.Neil Naismith’s career included 40 years membership of SHPA where he served on the Federal Council (1967–1973 and 1993–2000) and on the Victorian Branch Committee for over 15 years. In 1965, in conjunction with Fred J Boyd, Neil launched the Australian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy, and from 1965–1971 was the inaugural administrator of the journal. He also co-authored The History of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia in Victoria published in 1991.Neil Naismith became a Fellow of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia through his thesis entitled Pharmaceutical Practice in Australian Hospitals, this being the first SHPA Fellowship awarded by thesis. Naismith's commitment to quality use of medicines extended beyond hospital pharmacy. He served as both a State and National Councillor of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia (PSA) and was National President of PSA from 1991-1993. He was a Director of the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards and of the Australian Pharmaceutical Publishing Company, and a Councillor of the Health Professions Council of Australia. He was also a Member of the Hospital and Charities Commission Pharmacy Advisory Committee, and served on the Pharmacy Board of Victoria from 1974-2002. Naismith was a founding member of the Victorian Drug Usage Advisory Committee (established in 1986) and Chairman from 1986-May 2002. During this time he was also actively involved in driving the establishment and ongoing success of Therapeutic Guidelines Limited (TGL). He was a founding member of TGL's Board of Directors in 1996, remaining on the Board until 2002. Through his role as Director of Pharmacy at The Royal Melbourne Hospital, he was involved with the booklet, Antibiotic Guidelines, published in 1978. These guidelines are now in the 14th edition. Naismith was the 1982 recipient of the SHPA Fred J Boyd Award. He was awarded Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1991 for his services to the pharmacy profession, and the Merck Sharp and Dohme (Australia) Medal for Pharmacy Practice in 1993. The Neil Naismith Commemorative Lecture is presented annually to launch the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia Victorian Branch Continuing Professional Development program. It is dedicated to honour Naismith's contribution to the pharmacy profession."
