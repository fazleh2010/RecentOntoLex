  "text" : "Okaji no Kata (お梶の方) (December 7, 1578 – September 17, 1642) or Lady Okaji, was a concubine of Tokugawa Ieyasu. She came from a relatively unknown origin. She was either Ōta Dōkan's adopted daughter, Tōyama Naokage's daughter, or Edo Shigemichi's daughter. Her other names are Oha (お八の方) and Okatsu (お勝の方). Many people believe that Ieyasu met Okaji around the time he first settled in Edo. Due to her status as his concubine, her age when they met is not recorded but some historians postulate that she could have been in her early teens. The two met due to her older brother reaching a higher status. Ieyasu was pleased with her charming wit and fell in love with her quickly. She was going to marry Matsudaira Masatsuna but the arrangement was cancelled after she became pregnant. She bore Ieyasu's last child and daughter, Ichihime, who died at a very young age. Ieyasu is believed to have truly loved Okaji, and there are a few stories surrounding them. There was also an unverifiable tale that she dressed as a man and protected her husband at the Battle of Sekigahara. After Ieyasu's death in 1616, Okaji became a nun with the Buddhist name Eishō-in (英勝院). She died at the age of 65 years."

  "text" : "Otto von Wettstein, name also given as Otto Wettstein-Westersheimb, (7 August 1892, Vienna – 10 July 1967) was an Austrian zoologist. He was the son of botanist Richard Wettstein and the brother of botanist Fritz von Wettstein. He is best remembered for his work in the field of herpetology; of his 205 published scientific papers, 60 of these involved herpetological topics. Due to spells of severe tympanitis in his youth, Wettstein's hearing was greatly impaired as an adult. Beginning in 1915, he was associated with the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna. Here, his instructors included zoologists Karl Grobben and Franz Werner as well as paleontologist Othenio Abel. In 1920, he succeeded Friedrich Siebenrock as curator of the herpetological collection at the museum. Under Wettstein's helm, within five years, the museum's reptile and amphibian collection became one of the largest in Europe. With Franz Werner and botanist Karl Heinz Rechinger, he accumulated a collection of vertebrates from southeastern Europe, publishing \"Die Vogelwelt der Ägäis \" (The Birds of the Aegean, 1938) and \"Die Säugetierwelt der Ägäis \" (The Mammals of the Aegean, 1941) as a result. His work on Aegean amphibians and reptiles, \"Herpetologia Aegaea \", was based on excursions to the region in 1934, 1935, 1942 and 1954. In collaboration with others, he made important contributions to the multi-volume series \"Catalogus faunae Austriae \". After World War II, he worked as a forestry manager at the Federal Research Institute of Forestry in Mariabrunn. A subspecies of viper, Vipera ursinii wettsteini (Knöpfler & Sochurek, 1955) is named after him."

  "text" : "Olive McFarland (born Brenda McFarland 1929 – 24 August 2011) was a British actress who appeared in film and television dramas from the 1950s to the 1970s. She starred opposite Sean Connery in the 1961 film The Frightened City. McFarland's television appearances included The Sweeney, The Troubleshooters, The Champions and Dixon of Dock Green and she also had a film role in Alive and Kicking (1959). She left acting to restore properties and breed horses. In 1998 following an RSPCA inspection of her farm she was found guilty of neglecting her horses and received a one-month suspended jail sentence. In January 2010 she moved to a care home at Eye, Suffolk, not far from her farm at Creeting St Mary near Needham Market. She was killed when she was hit by a train at a nearby railway crossing the following year. In September 2016, Network Rail were fined £4 million at Ipswich Crown Court over health and safety failures in connection with McFarland's death."

Because of this family connection Oda was a cousin of the first Holy Roman Emperor, Otto I the Great. In 930, Oda married Gozlin, Count of Bidgau and Methingau, who gained fame as military commander for his brother, Adalberon I of Metz. Because she outlived her husband by twenty years, she was head of the household and ran the estate and lands until their children had reached adulthood. They had the following children: \n* Reginar, count of Bastogne (d. 18 Apr 963) \n* Henry (d. 6 Sep 1000) \n* Godfrey (935/940 – 3 Sep 995/1002), count of Verdun \n* Adalberon (935/940 – 23 Jan 989), archbishop of Reims 969-989"

This curriculum became the centre of a European network of academic cooperation in legal sciences that is open to new forms of studies and research internationalisation. Otmar Seul’s most innovative idea was the creation in 2004 of French-German summer universities with other European and non-European countries. His research on industrial democracy and employee participation in companies reflects this French-German and European intercultural dimension."

  "text" : "Owen Gruffydd (1643-1730) was a Welsh poet partly noted for a lament on the decline of the Welsh language in the early 18th century. Not much is known about Owen Gruffydd's early life and career except that he was born in the parish of Llanystumdwy, Caernarfonshire. It is likely that he lived much of his life there and in the outlying parishes. Gruffydd was a weaver by profession. He was, however, known more for his poetic gifts. He also earned a name as a genealogist."

He is remembered for his reform efforts in regards to biology education; as a zoologist, he specialized in research of copepods. Following the death of his parents, he became a student of the Francke Foundations in Halle an der Saale. Beginning in 1880, he worked as schoolteacher in the community of Zörbig, then returned to Halle as a teacher in 1883. In 1891 he obtained his doctorate in zoology at Leipzig as a student of Rudolf Leuckart, and three years later was named rector of the Wilhelmstädter Volksschule in Magdeburg. In 1904 he left the teaching profession in order to pursue a literary career. During his tenure at Magdeburg, he focused on education reform, in particular, the teaching of biology. In this regard, he strove to move away from the literal approach of instruction, while stressing the need for students to observe nature firsthand and to discover its causal relationships. His \"Über die Reformbestrebungen auf dem Gebiete des naturgeschichtlichen Unterrichts\" (On reform efforts in the areas of natural history teaching) was published over several editions."

In 1717 he transferred to the newly created regiment of Colonel Richard Philipps (later the 40th Regiment of Foot), becoming a lieutenant in 1718, adjutant of the regiment in 1729, captain in 1739 and major in January 1745/46. He became involved in the government of Nova Scotia, firstly as secretary and then as a member of the Council. He was also co-opted into two commissions to resolve border disputes. In 1744 he was appointed Lieutenant-governor of Placentia, Newfoundland, where he worked hard to improve the conditions of the colony and the military garrison, remaining there until at least 1764. He was involved in the removal of the Acadians at Annapolis. By 1768 he had returned to Great Britain and taken up residence in Waterford, Ireland, where he died in 1770. He was the father of Captain John Hamilton who was taken into captivity during the Siege of Grand Pre."

  "text" : "Oliver Jones (c.1610-1682) was an Irish politician and judge of the seventeenth century; he was noted for his Roman Catholic sympathies, and for his willingness to change sides during the English Civil War. He was born in Athlone, the third son of John Jones, a merchant, and Jane Messett. He was admitted to the King's Inns in 1638. He entered the Irish House of Commons as member for Athlone in 1639. He was widely believed to have Roman Catholic sympathies, and as a result he clashed with the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Earl of Strafford and with Richard Bolton, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland; after Strafford's downfall in 1641 Jones was active in the impeachment of the Earl's key ally, Lord Chancellor Bolton. Amidst the general turmoil which followed the Irish Rebellion of 1641, little is known of his activities until 1649, when he was appointed Attorney General for the province of Connacht. In 1652, despite his supposed Roman Catholic beliefs, he was prepared to swear an oath to be true and faithful to the Cromwellian regime. After the Restoration of Charles II,this was not held against him, presumably since several of his new colleagues on the Bench had also made their peace with Cromwell, and the restored Stuart dynasty was, within reason, prepared to overlook their past record of disloyalty. He was restored to his old office, returned to the House of Commons as member for Roscommon County, and was then living in Roscommon Castle. In 1662 he became Chief Justice of Connacht, and made a valuable ally in the Lord President of Connaught, Lord Berkeley. As a judge he was noted for willingness to give impartial justice to Roman Catholics, which no doubt fuelled the general belief that he was a Catholic himself. In 1670, Lord Berkeley, during his relatively brief term as Lord Lieutenant, promoted Jones to a seat on the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland), and he was transferred in 1672 to the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). This promotion no doubt caused some comment in view of his known leaning towards Catholicism; but in post-Restoration Ireland the religious atmosphere was relatively tolerant, especially in the early 1670s, and Jones was far from being the only High Court judge with Catholic leanings. He was even spoken of as a possible Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1673, although his religious beliefs probably did disqualify him on that occasion. He continued to go regularly as judge of assize to Connacht. He died in 1682 and was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He was married with children, although little seems to be known of his family."

Eisen was born in Kyoto, evidently the grandson of Chinese immigrants, and adopted into the Okuda family of pawnbrokers. Although he inherited the family business, at age 35 he devoted his attention to amateur pottery, and by the 1780s he was producing copies of late Ming-period enamelled porcelain. He also made kochi (polychrome ware), sometsuke (underglaze cobalt or blue-and-white) and ko akae (old red ware) as utensils for the tea ceremony and for drinking sencha (green tea). His disciples included Aoki Mokubei, Kinkodo Kamesuke (1764-1837), and Nin'ami Dohachi (1783-1855)."

  "text" : "Otaram Dewasi is member of Rajasthan Legislative Assembly. He was elected to the assembly from Sirohi in 2008 and again in 2013 as a candidate of Bharatiya Janata Party. He has served as the chairman of Rajasthan Livestock Board.Otaram Devasi, 48, happens to be the Rajasthan's minister in charge of cow affairs. As for himself, India's first-ever minister for the 'divine' bovine likes to address himself as \"Gaupalan Mantri\". BJP and Vasundhara Raje had promised a separate ministry for cows in its poll manifesto. And when the party came to power with Raje as CM in December 2013, she promptly announced a ministry for the protection of cows, which was later transformed to a \"department\" after the move struck a Constitutional hurdle since states can't set up new ministries. In October, 2014, Devasi was made minister of Dairy and Devasthan - administration of temples that get government funds - with the extra charge of the \"Gaupalan department\". His responsibility also includes overseeing Rajasthan's Gau Seva Commission and Cow Conservation Directorate. Three months into his tenure, Devasi says he is proud of what he has done with securing the future of cows in this desert state. And he believes he has set up a department for rest of India to emulate should any other state want to follow this 'Rajasthan Model. Devasi, who himself owns \"20-25 cows\", wants the canvas for cow protection to be bigger. \"I have sought an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the Union budget so that I can impress upon him on the urgent need to set up a cow ministry at the Centre,\" Devasi tells ET. \"I believe if cows have to be saved then every state in India must have separate ministries for cows,\" he says, insisting that he's not being just rhetorical. So what about buffalos, goats, even the state's official animal, camel? Devasi dismisses the question, almost chiding you for being naive. \"Cows have a spiritual importance unlike other livestock animals. They must be protected at any cost. I would request Modiji to ban cow slaughter and, if need be, introduce strong legislation for that,\" he says. For Rajasthan, there are three things high on his agenda: clamping down on rampant cattle smuggling, introduction of a helpline number on the lines of 108 ambulance services to help cattle in distress besides starting a one-of-its-kind \"sanctuary\" for cows near Bikaner or Jaisalmer. By sanctuary, he mans a protected area full of green grass not far from the desert so that the cows, especially those of the indigenous breed, can eat and live in peace. Another day, another time, the 6 feet-1 inch-tall Devasi would have stood even taller among the Sangh Parivar stars. Long before Ghar Wapsi or Ram Mandir became fashionable causes for the typical Hindutva agitator, 'Gau Raksha' was the first priority of the Sangh. In fact, the only open public intervention ever done by the most powerful Sarsangchalak of RSS ever, MS Golwalkar, was on 'gau raksha'. माँ चामुंडा जी के परम् भक्त, माननीय मंत्री श्रीमान ओटाराम जी देवासी की यह कहानी बड़ी रोचक है। श्रीमान ओटाराम जी देवासी पहले राजस्थान पुलिस में सिपाही थे। बाद में उनकी तबियत ठीक नहीं रहने लगी तो नौकरी छोड़ दी। ओटाराम जी देवासी बाली विधानसभा क्षेत्र में आने वाले मुंडारा गांव के रहने वाले हैं। जब तबियत खराब रहने लगी तो घर वाले उनके खुद के गांव में बने मुंडारा गांव के चामुंडा माता जी मंदिर ले गए। बताते हैं कि चामुंडा माता की कृपा और आस्था से उनकी तबियत ठीक हो गई। पशुपालन से जुड़ी रबारी जाति के ओटाराम जी उसके बाद से चामुंडा माता के परम भक्त हो गए। अब वो मुंडारा माता जी मंदिर के मुखया महंत हैं। मुखया महंत होने की वजह से इलाके में हजारों- लोग उनके श्रद्धा से धोक लगाते हैं। पश्चिमी राजस्थान के रबारी समाज के लोगों के ओटाराम देवासी एकसत्र नेता है। सबसे पहले ऊन पर पूर्व मुख्यमंत्री भैरो सिंह जी शेखावत की नजर पड़ी। वरिष्ठ नेता ओम प्रकाश जी माथुर ने ओटाराम देवासी जी को शेखावत जी से मिलवाया था। तब ओटाराम देवासी ने बाली से भाजपा प्रत्याशी बने भैरो सिंह शेखावत की रेबारी समाज के वोट दिलवाने में मदद की थी। इसके बाद अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी की सरकार में ओटाराम देवासी को केंद्रीय राज्यमंत्री का दर्जा देते हुए दिल्ली के बीज निगम के चैयरमेन बनाया गया। इसके बाद ओटाराम देवासी का संपर्क मुख्यमंत्री वसुंधरा राजे जी से हुआ। वसुंधरा राजे जी ने उनके अपनी पिछली सरकार में पशुपालन कल्यान बोर्ड के चेयरमैन बनाकर राज्यमंत्री का दर्जा दिया। राजनीति में कद बढ़ने के साथ ही लंबी- चौड़ी कद काठी के ओटाराम जी देवासी की लोकप्रियता बढ़ती ही गई। पिछले विधानसभा चुनावों में वसुंधरा राजे ने उनको को सिरोही विधानसभा सीट से प्रत्याशी बनाया। ओटाराम जी देवासी वसुंधरा राजे की उम्मीदों पर खरे उतरे चुनाव जीत गए। 2014- 2015 विधानसभा चुनावों दुबारा 25,000 हजार वोट से फिर भाजपा को जीत दिलाई। इस बार ओटाराम जी देवासी को गोपालन एवं देवस्थान विभाग राजस्थान के राज्यमंत्री बनाया गया है। BY ARJUN SINGH {08107559697}                                                                                         VERY CLOSE SUPPORTER OF SH.

  "text" : "Oleksandr Hryhorovych Yakymenko (Ukrainian: Олександр Григорович Якименко) (born December 22, 1964 in Keila, Estonian SSR) is a Russian military pilot and a Ukraine public servant, former Head of the Security Service of Ukraine. After graduation of the Military Aviation College for Pilots in Yeysk in 1986, he served in the Soviet Armed Forces and the Armed Forces of Russia until 1998. At first Yakymenko was stationed in Choibalsan, Mongolia until withdrawal of the Soviet troops. Later he was relocated to Hvardiiske in Crimea where in 1991-1998 he served in the Military Aviation Forces of Black Sea Fleet (Russian Federation). In 1997 Yakymenko graduated the Gagarin Air Force Academy. There is no information about Yakymenko ever receiving citizenship of Ukraine. In 1998-99 he worked for a militarized security of the Donetsk State Aviation Company \"Donetsk – SAU\" (SAU is an abbreviation for Eastern Aviation Lines). In his official biography Yakymenko claims that he worked in the Security Service of Ukraine in 1999 to 2007 in leading positions, yet does not disclose in what exactly and without any details. On 10 January 2013 in interview to Gazeta in Ukrainian, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko stated that nobody in the Ukrainian parliament knows the real biography of the SBU director. In 2007-08 Yakymenko was an advisor for internal security for one of the companies that are part of System Capital Management. From 2008 to 2010 the official biography of Yakymenko states that he worked part time without any contracts and the biography does not specify where and for whom Yakymenko was working. Soon after election of Viktor Yanukovych the President of Ukraine in 2010, Yakymenko was appointed the head of SBU in Sevastopol and a year later the head of SBU in Donetsk Oblast. During that time he was promoted to the rank of Major General of the Security Service of Ukraine. In 2012 Yakymenko was appointed the First Deputy Director of SBU and in 2013 Yanukovych appointed him the Director of Security Service of Ukraine without properly introducing him to the Ukrainian parliament. On February 19, 2014, on the website of SBU Yakymenko announced that Security Service of Ukraine and Anti-Terrorist Center initiated an \"anti-terrorist operation\" against protesters of the Euromaidan. On February 20, 2014 on the streets of Kiev appeared snipers and special assigned units of MVS and SBU. On February 22, 2014 the Ukrainian parliament installed a parliamentary commissioner to check the SBU activities, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko who the next day announced that all leadership of Security Service of Ukraine quit. On February 24, 2014 Ukrainian parliament officially relieved Yakymenko of his duties as a Director of Security Service of Ukraine and on the proposition of the acting President of Ukraine appointed Nalyvaichenko in his place. A few days after the February 2014 Ukrainian revolution Yakymenko with about 15 former SBU top officials surfaced in Russia. Yakymenko is wanted by the General Prosecutor of Ukraine and his believed to be hiding in Russia."

Feldman is also a co-founder of the Institute of Human Rights and the Prevention of Extremism and Xenophobia. Feldman first entered the Ukrainian parliament after winning a single-member district located in Kharkiv during the 2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election. In parliament he joined the United Ukraine faction and when that party merged with Batkivshchyna Feldman joined this party too. Batkivshchyna was a part of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc during the 2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election and 2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election Feldman was re-eleted into parliament on a party ticket of this bloc of political parties. He also was of its Kharkiv regional party organization. In March 2011 Feldman left the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc faction in parliament and joined the Party of Regions. He did so citing to much influence of nationalism in the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc. In the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election Feldman won a parliamentary seat in a single-member district located in Kharkiv for Party of Regions. In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election Feldman as an independent candidate won the same single-member district as in 2012 with 64.94% of the votes. Feldman joined the party Our Land in August 2015."

At the age of 14, Shuping became part of the male choir Atteridgeville Happy Boys, playing regional events. The group did not release an album until 1992, Mahlomoleng Aka. However, the band temporarily stopped recording after two more albums because they felt they were not being properly compensated for their albums. During this time, Shuping released a successful solo album, Segopolopolo Boikgnatsho. He would continue releasing solo, backed by The African Gospel Singers, and with his band. In 2004, he created his own record label, OSSH Productions. Shuping died on 12 July 2010 of pneumonia. He had been in poor health since a serious car accident on 12 June 2006 left him a quadriplegic and cost him a lung, leaving him unable to sing."

  "text" : "Olof August Danielsson (born 15 October 1852 in the District Hamari parish, Östergötland County; died 10 July 1933) was a Swedish linguist and classical philologist. Olof August Danielsson was born to Daniel Danielsson, a shoemaker, and Anna Brita Olofsdotter. In 1870 Danielsson began his studies in Uppsala. In 1879 he was Associate Professor of Classical Languages at the University in Uppsala, and was professor of comparative linguistics (1883-1884) and Greek language and literature (1884-1891). He was appointed professor of classical languages at Göteborg University, although he never took up the appointment, becoming professor of Greek language and literature at Uppsala University instead. Danielsson was elected as a member of the Academy of Letters in 1901 and the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1905. Danielsson was unmarried. Danielson was a leading Etruscologist and resided at various times in Italy to examine and copy Etruscan inscriptions. Together with C. Pauli he launched the Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum, which began to appear in 1893."

  "text" : "Ola Christian Christofersen (23 September 1866 – 24 September 1922) was a Norwegian newspaper editor. He was born in Sørum as a son of leather trader Martin Christofersen (1843–1925) and Caroline Mathea Johnsen (1833–1890). In 1897 he married wholesaler's daughter Olga Jensine Brodtkorb (1878–1920). His sister married roads director Andreas Baalsrud, making Christofersen as uncle of Terje Baalsrud and Jan Baalsrud. Christofersen finished his secondary education in 1886 and took the University's admission test in 1887. He then enrolled in the Norwegian Military Academy, reaching the ranks of Premier Lieutenant in 1892 and Captain 1901. While stuyding at the Military Academy and later law (without graduating), he edited the Norwegian edition of Illustreret Konversationsleksikon and worked in Retsbladet. He was hired as a journalist in Ørebladet in 1891, and became chief editor in 1892. He also became the private secretary of Fridtjof Nansen in the same year, and as such Nansen's secretary during the 1893–1896 Fram expedition. From 1894 to 1897 he also worked in Morgenbladet. He then became a journalist in Aftenposten, being promoted to subeditor in 1899 and financial director in 1906. He was a close aide to chief editor Amandus Schibsted, and upon Schibsted's death in 1913 he was succeeded by Christofersen and Thorstein Diesen. Christofersen almost never wrote in the paper, but handled practical affairs. He was more of a pecuniary strategist than the politically inclined Diesen, leading to professional and personal disagreements during the First World War. Christofersen withdrew in 1919. Christofersen was a co-founder of Kristiania Journalist Club, which he chaired from 1895 to 1899 and 1904 to 1906. For his own partisan press he served as vice chairman of the Conservative Press Association from 1903 to 1909. He was later a board member of the nationwide Norwegian Press Association. He died in September 1922 in Kristiania."

  "text" : "Orlando Brown (September 26, 1801 – July 6, 1867) was a Kentucky politician, newspaper publisher and historian, who also held the office of Indian Commissioner during the Zachary Taylor administration. Brown was a Whig and an anti-secessionist. He was the son of John Brown, Kentucky's first member of Congress. Orlando Brown received his appointment as Indian Commissioner based on his loyalty to the Taylor campaign, and used it to distribute further patronage appointments. He became disillusioned with the position, and resigned it on July 1, 1850, eight days before Taylor died. Brown spent most of his later years working on a history of Kentucky governors, but his work was uncompleted when he died in 1867."

  "text" : "Otabek Mahkamov (Uzbek: Otabek Mahkamov, Отабек Маҳкамов; Russian: Отабек Махкамов) (born September 5, 1984) is an Uzbek film actor and lawyer. Mahkamov is mostly known for his supporting roles in several Uzbek films. The actor usually plays negative characters. He has also appeared in music videos of several Uzbek singers, most notably in Ozodbek Nazarbekov's \"Meni kuchliroq sev\". Mahkamov's first studio movie appearance was in the 2010 film Boʻrilar 3: Oxirgi qarz (Wolves 3: The Final Debt). In the movie, he played the role of a criminal investigator. He achieved further notability in Uzbekistan after his role as an investigator in the 2011 film Majruh (Insane). Other notable films in which Mahkamov has appeared include Men yulduzman (I'm a Star) (2012), Jodugar (The Witch) (2012), Yondiradi, kuydiradi (My Love, My Pain) (2012), and Fotima (Fotima) (2013). In 2015, it became known that Mahkamov had made contradictory and false claims about his birthplace, academic qualifications, and skills. The first article that brought to light the contradictions in Mahkamov's claims was published by the Osh-based literature website Ijodkor. A month later the Uzbek entertainment website Sayyod published a short article which stated that Mahkamov had provided Uzbek journalists with false information about his background. The author fell short of directly accusing Mahkamov, but promised to publish a more detailed account of the matter. In an interview with the Uzbek tabloid Bekajon, Mahkamov denied the accusations. However, he refused to comment on the contradictions in his claims and only stated that \"Those rumors you're talking about are unfounded\"."
