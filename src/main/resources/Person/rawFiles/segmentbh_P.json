He is renowned as Mahaguru (the great teacher) especially among the Limbus. He is remembered for his outstanding socio-cultural and religious messages in the Limbu ethnicity, while not less exemplary are these to others as well. His one message is practice no animal sacrifice, since this sacrifice (taboo) raises social expenditures on celebrations; like birth, wedding and funeral. His further messages are similarly: eliminate social orthodoxies, run school for children, give literacy and awareness to children through their mother tongue. Education he stressed on chiefly because he believed it brings in knowledge to wash one's heart clean which alone is key to emancipation which again is the Ultimate Truth to realize God. In his philosophy there can be no better friend than love and nonviolence. Falgunanda who also built innumerable shrines died in 1949.

  "text" : "Pierre Martory (December 1, 1920 – October 5, 1998) was a French poet whose influence on New York School poets was quiet but profound. His work was admired by Frank O'Hara, James Schuyler, Harry Mathews, and others, and translated extensively by John Ashbery, with whom he shared his life in Paris for nearly a decade. His work has appeared in many books in both England and the United States, as well as in The New Yorker and Poetry. Martory’s personal “charm,” the poet Ann Lauterbach once said, “devolved back to the original meaning of ‘spell.’” However, as Ashbery has noted, “Both the humor and the sadness in his poems are always rendered with an unemphatic clarity that is certainly Mozartian.”Born in Bayonne, France, of partly Basque ancestry, Pierre Martory spent much of his early life in Morocco. He joined the Free French Forces in North Africa when World War II interrupted his college studies at the School of Political Science, Paris. Afterwards, he began writing fiction and poetry and studied music as well. In 1953, Denoël published his first novel, Phébus ou le beau mariage. His other novels remain unpublished. For more than twenty years, he was drama and music critic at Paris Match, where he mentored and worked with the journalist Denis Demonpion, now editor of Le Point and a biographer. John Ashbery, in France on a Fulbright scholarship, met Martory in March 1956, and they lived together there for nine years, inspiring and influencing each other’s work. Ashbery dedicated The Tennis Court Oath (1962), one of his most experimental collections, to Martory. As Ashbery suggests, Martory composed poetry with “trace elements of Holderlin, Rilke and Trakl,” with “echoes of ‘fringe’ surrealists like Pierre Reverdy and the chameleon-like Raymond Queneau,” and with “the austerity of Jouve’s poetry and the cloudy fantasy of Supervielle’s. . . . There is a touch of the gaiety of Charles Trenet and of René Clair’s early films; of the blues of his favorite singers Florel and Piaf.” But as Ashbery concludes, “In the end, the only fruitful comparison seems to be with Arthur Rimbaud, and not because Martory’s poetry resembles his, but because both are similar in resembling no one else.”Martory collaborated with Francis Wishart on a volume of text and etchings entitled Père Lachaise in the seventies, and Wishart also created art for a posthumous collaboration, Oh, Lac / Oh, Lake, in 2008. In 1990, Ashbery translated Martory’s first poetry collection, Every Question but One (Intuflo Editions–Groundwater Press, 1990). Of his second collection, The Landscape is Behind the Door (Sheep Meadow Press, 1994), Ashbery says, “His dreams, his pessimistic résumés of childhood that are suddenly lanced by a joke, his surreal loves, his strangely lit landscapes with their inquisitive birds and disquieting flora, are fertile influences for me.” Veilleur de jours (Alyscamps Press/Sheep Meadow Press, 1997), his first French collection, contains a broad selection of work. An extensive selection of his poetry and an essay on Henry James's Washington Square appear in Ashbery's two Collected French Translations volumes. Schuyler's poem \"Letter to a Friend: Who Is Nancy Daum\" refers to an Alex Katz portrait of Martory with a pipe, in the collection of the Flow Chart Foundation. An interview in The American Poetry Review with the poet from 1992 is available online. In the Times Literary Supplement, the poet Mark Ford predicts a wider recognition to come for this transatlantic poet: \"It is to be hoped that, just as Edgar Allan Poe only became acceptable to Americans once endorsed by Baudelaire, the French will soon find themselves belatedly discovering one of their finest twentieth-century poets, and saluting him in the niche in the poetic pantheon prepared by his American admirers.\""

  "text" : "Piper Anne Wind Campbell is an American diplomat. She was the 9th U.S. Ambassador to Mongolia. Campbell was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1965, the daughter of Gay and David N. Campbell. She attended Nichols School in Buffalo and was inspired to pursue a career in the Foreign Service after a study abroad program in Japan. She obtained a bachelor's degree from Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in 1988 and joined the Foreign Service in 1989. Campbell's early assignments included Manila, Brussels, the State Department's Operations Center in Washington, DC, and the Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs. In 1996 she joined the civil affairs section of a United Nations peacekeeping mission in eastern Croatia and helped open an office of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Eastern Slavonia, Croatia. In 1999 Campbell took a year's leave to pursue a master's degree in Public Administration from the Harvard Kennedy School. Campbell went on to work at the U.S. Missions to the United Nations in New York (1999-2002) and Geneva (2002-2006). From 2006 to 2009 she was the Deputy Chief of Mission in Phnom Penh, Cambodia where she spent almost five months as chargé d'affaires ad interim from August 25, 2008, to January 19, 2009. She then became Chief of Staff to the first-ever Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Jacob J. Lew (the current Treasury Secretary), and his successor Thomas R. Nides. From June 2011-June 2012, Ms. Campbell served as the senior civilian representative of the U.S. government in southern Iraq, opening Consulate General Basra on July 5, 2011. President Barack Obama nominated Campbell as U.S. Ambassador to Mongolia on March 5. 2012 and the U.S. Senate confirmed her on June 29, 2012. She was sworn in on August 6, 2012 and presented her credentials to President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj on August 24, 2012. Campbell's focus as Ambassador to Mongolia has been \"steering the U.S. government interaction with Mongolia, driving that relationship through a change, a transition.\"  She has stated that there are three main areas upon which she would like to strengthen ties between the U.S. and Mongolia; broadening commercial development, military and development cooperation, and cultural cooperation. Campbell's tour in Mongolia ended in 2015."

  "text" : "Paul Flowers FRSA FRGS (born 5 June 1950) is an English local politician and ordained Methodist minister, currently suspended indefinitely by the church. He is a former Labour councillor in Rochdale, and was non-executive chairman of the Co-operative Bank. In 2013, the activities of Flowers, who had occupied a variety of powerful political and business posts and had been appointed by Labour leader Ed Miliband to a senior post in 2010, were widely reported in the media. Flowers was filmed by an acquaintance in his car apparently agreeing to buy cocaine and methamphetamine, and appearing to count large sums of money while discussing his use of a range of other non-medicinal drugs. He was subsequently taken to court and convicted of possession of drugs. Soon after the film of the apparent purchase of illicit drugs was released to the media, it was revealed that, while deputy head of social services at Rochdale Council, Flowers had known about the activities of paedophiles at a residential boys' school, but had not informed parents or taken measures to close the school, was responsible for rejecting allegations of child sex abuse against the late Rochdale MP Cyril Smith, and that, in 2011, while working at Bradford Council, \"inappropriate but not illegal adult content was found on a council computer handed in by Councillor Flowers for servicing. This was put to him and he resigned immediately.\" Several newspapers reported allegations that he communicated with rent boys using his work email account while he was in charge of the Co-operative Bank, and was convicted of carrying out a sex act in a public toilet more than 30 years ago. After the bank lost £700m in the first half of 2013, and a £1.5 billion hole in the bank's finances was discovered by the new chief executive Euan Sutherland in May 2013, Flowers resigned in June 2013."

He was born in Flemington, near Navan in County Meath. Little is known of his early career. He was appointed Baron of the Exchequer in 1521, and apart from a short period on the Court of King's Bench (Ireland) served on the Court of Exchequer until his death. He was one of the original lessees of the King's Inns in 1541. He became a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1533, and was knighted. John Rawson, the last Prior of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem at Kilmainham, and later Viscount Clontarf, had by then been for many years the dominant influence on the Privy Council, and White is known to have been close to him, marrying his son to Rawson's natural daughter. Like most of his fellow judges he was enriched by the Dissolution of the Monasteries; he obtained lands at Clontarf which had belonged to the Order of St John (which was dissolved in 1541), possibly at Rawson's suggestion.He also held lands at Rathsallagh in County Wicklow. He died in 1561, while still in office on the Court of Exchequer. He married twice: little is known of his first wife. His second wife was Alison St Lawrence, daughter of Nicholas St Lawrence, 4th Baron Howth, and widow of John Netterville. He had at least two children: \n* Rowland, who married Catherine Rawson, natural daughter of Viscount Clontarf \n* Margaret, who married Walter Forster, alderman of Dublin, and had issue."

Jackson was the Chairman of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group of the Species Survival Commission between 1983 and 2000, and subsequently became chairman emeritus. He is a world-renowned tiger conservationist who was involved in tiger research and conservation efforts since the late 1960s. His interest in tigers arose during 18 years in India as a news correspondent, which led to work with WWF International, Operation Tiger, India's Project Tiger, and conservation programs in Nepal, Thailand and Indonesia. Peter Jackson has co-authored and co-edited several publications on big cats and tigers, including Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan, compiled and edited by Kristin Nowell and Peter Jackson (IUCN 1996), and Riding the Tiger: Tiger Conservation in Human Dominated Landscapes (Cambridge University Press 1999). Jackson initially worked independently to promote tiger conservation. In 1983 he became the Chair of the Cat Specialist Group. He held this position for 17 years. In 2004 a newly established subspecies of the tiger, Malayan tiger, was given a name Panthera tigris jacksoni in honour of Peter Jackson."

  "text" : "Peter Halldorf (born 21 June 1958) is a Swedish Pentecostal pastor, self-taught theologian, and writer. He is known for exploring Patristics, particularly the Desert Fathers, within a Pentecostal context. His interest has led him to be dubbed \"The Pentecostal Monk\" and sometimes prays in Coptic monasteries. He is a third generation Pentecostal preacher who became interested in the Desert Fathers out of concerns Pentecostalism could fall into worldliness or shallowness. He also found an ultimate \"gentleness\" in much of the Desert Fathers stories. Peter Halldorf is additionally a two-time winner of the Emmausprisen for Christian writing."

  "text" : "Peter Stas (born 1963) is a Dutch entrepreneur and author. In 1988, after he completed his studies in Business Economics at the Erasmus University and worked as Product-Marketing Manager for Royal Philips Electronics, he founded, with his wife Aletta Stas-Bax, the watch company Frédérique Constant. The manufacture's initial strategy was to focus its energy on classical luxury watches at an affordable price. The Accessible Luxury positioning was the basis of strong growth during the financial crisis when consumers came back more to classical values and accessible prices. Peter Stas played an outspoken role in a conflict with the Swatch Group after it announced a reduction in its provision of watch component parts to third parties. Stas said the proposed cuts would establish an unfair advantage and stifle competition, and not be good for the Swiss watch industry or consumer choice. A legal action to request a freeze before the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland together with eight independent watch and movement companies to block the 2012 cuts was rejected. After a long standoff, Switzerland’s Competition Commission (COMCO) finally ruled that it would not allow the Swatch Group to reduce supplies of assortments (i.e. the regulating organ of a mechanical movement: escape wheel, pallet lever, balance wheel and balance spring) that it sells to Swiss watch brands outside the group. In 2002, to diversify the Frédérique Constant group, Stas and his wife acquired Alpina Watches, a manufacturer of Swiss sports watches founded in 1883. In 2009, Stas co-founded Ateliers deMonaco, a high-end watch manufacturer based in Monaco. In 2013, in collaboration with Aletta Stas, Gisbert L. Brunner and Alexander Linz, Peter Stas wrote the book Live your passion, Building a watch manufacture. In 2015, Stas played a substantial role in the introduction of the \"Horological Smartwatch\", a smartwatch design that uses a secondary analog dial rather than a screen for its display – giving the timepiece a more classic look than other such devices. The Horological Smartwatch product line included models for both the Frédérique Constant and Alpina watch brands, and used \"MotionX\" core technology licensed from the California-based company Fullpower Technologies. It was developed in a joint venture known as Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT). Peter Stas is currently CEO of Frédérique Constant."

  "text" : "Paul Niehans (21 November 1882 – 1 September 1971) was a Swiss doctor who was one of the developers of cellular therapy. His renown grew through his treatment of celebrities such as Pope Pius XII, King Ibn Saud, Konrad Adenauer and Charlie Chaplin. Live cell therapy (or fresh cell therapy), developed in the ’30s by Swiss doctor Paul Niehans, involves harvesting fresh cells from cow or sheep embryo and injecting them directly (intramuscular) into the person’s buttocks. There is no evidence is it useful for any health problem. In 1937, influenced by the work of the neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing, Niehans first used cerebral cells, from the hypothalamus and the hypophysis. Beginning in 1948, he also used liver, pancreas, kidney, heart, duodenum, thymus, and spleen cells. In 1949, he began to use lyophilized (freeze-dried) cells, not only fresh ones. In 1953, Paul Niehans treated Pope Pius XII, who in gratitude appointed him member of the Papal Academy of Sciences. In the United States, it is not legally available because of safety concerns and lack of proof of its effectiveness. In 1954, Niehans' work, Die Zellulartherapie (Cellular Therapy) was published in German. Swiss publisher Thoune released the English version and update of Niehans' original work which also included papers by researchers from Germany."

Haas had, however, particularly for economic reasons, undertook to carry out ordering graphics such as business cards, embroidery patterns and almanacs. He selected in 1786 to follow his brother Meno to Berlin, where he continued his diverse business, including portrait miniatures, a series Berlin Prospectuses, and a series of scenes from Frederick the Great's life.

After the Khmer Issarak movement disintegrated due to internal political differences, Phiset was elected to represent Battambang (Phra Tabong) in the Thai parliament during the administration of his brother-in-law. After Khuang resigned as Prime Minister and Thailand again ceded the western Cambodian provinces back to French Indochina, Phiset and former Khmer Issarak members formed the Khmer National Liberation Committee (KNLC) in 1948 to further armed resistance against French rule of Cambodia. The KNLC attempted to distance itself from the Indochinese Communist Party and purge other leftists from within its own ranks paving the way for Phiset to become Chairman in 1949. However, he was removed from that position less than a year later after being accused of misappropriating money designating for purchasing weapons."

  "text" : "Patrick 'Pat' Gerard Scammell (born April 15, 1961) is a retired Australian runner who specialized in the 1500 metres. Scammell competed at both the 1984 and 1988 Olympic Games, reaching the semi finals of the 1500 metres in 1988. He also competed at the 1987 and 1991 World Championships, as well as the 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1994 Commonwealth Games. After coming second on four previous occasions, Scammell was Australian 1500 metres champion in 1992, his first Australian title. Born and raised in Albury (NSW), Scammell first trained under David Jones, before moving to Canberra. Throughout his 16-year career, he was coached by Pat Clohessy and Chris 'Rab' Wardlaw in Australia. During his time in the European 1986 - 1990 seasons, he was guided by John Anderson in London. Scammell can claim to be the Australian who has clocked more sub 4 minute miles than any other Australia, a total of 28 times. The first time was in 1982 and in 1991 he set what would be his lifetime best of 3:53.58.

In 1883 he undertook a zoological expedition to eastern Sudan and Eritrea, in which he collected a number of Hymenoptera species new to science. In 1900, he returned to Eritrea, where he spent two months collecting more zoological specimens. He donated his African collections to the zoological museums in Genoa and Milan. In addition to his work with African species, he conducted research of Hymenoptera native to Burma. During the last years of his life, he worked as a curator at the Natural History Museum of Milan. Magretti was the author of 28 publications on Hymenoptera. Besides his endeavours in entomology, Magretti was also a cyclist, winning the first edition of the Milano–Torino race in 1876."

He was also elected to the National Defence Commission in April 2011 and promoted to Politburo full member in April 2012, largely replacing Jon Pyong-ho as North Korea's military industry manager. In that capacity, Pak supervised the Kwangmyongsong-3 and Kwangmyongsong-3 Unit 2 launches in 2012, as well as controversial nuclear tests in February 2013. He was demoted from member of the NDC in April 2015 and appears to have stepped down as central leadership member ever since."

In his journalism career spanning over 60 years, Chopra worked for the The Hindu and The Tribune and produced two magazines, The Citizen and The Weekend Review, but is most commonly associated with The Statesman after he became the newspaper's first Indian chief editor after its transfer from British ownership in the early 1960s. He was fired from The Statesman in the late 1960s for refusing to reflect the attitude of the paper's management to the United Front government in West Bengal. From the late 1990s, he was a freelance journalist and writer, who wrote, edited or contributed to over a dozen books on Indian and South Asian politics and democracy. He died on 22 December 2013, aged 92, after a short illness."

  "text" : "Paul Policastro (August 29, 1900 - November 4, 1981) was an American Democratic Party politician who served five terms in the New Jersey General Assembly. He was a graduate of Lafayette College and Rutgers Law School and served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He served on the Newark Board of Adjustment from 1953 to 1954. He first ran for the State Assembly in 1959, but lost. He ran again in 1961 and won. He was re-elected in 1963, 1965, 1967, and 1969. He served as Assistant Majority Leader in 1966 and as Majority Leader in 1967. Had Democrats not lost the majority in the 1967 election, Policastro was expected to become Assembly Speaker. In 1971, Policastro lost his bid for re-election to a fifth term, losing to an independent candidate, Newark vigilante leader Anthony Imperiale. Imperiale received 13,857 votes, followed by Policastro's running mate, incumbent Democratic Assemblyman Frank Megaro with 12,436 votes. Policastro ran third with 10,825 votes, followed by incumbent Republican Assemblyman C. Richard Fiore with 8,215 votes and Republican challenger Ralph D'Ambola with 7,351 votes."

In 1886, Abbelen petitioned the Vatican to recognise German-speaking Catholic parishes in the United States in parallel to English-speaking parishes mostly filled with Irish immigrant Catholics. Abbelen sought this partly in order to allow for a slower integration into American life and in the belief that it would preserve the faith of German immigrants. The Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith did not decide in his favour."

He was president of the French Entomological Society (Société entomologique de France) in 1907. He was president of the French Zoological Society (Société zoologique de France) in 1909. In 1883 Marchal received his undergraduate degree from the Academy of Paris (University of France). In 1889 he received a doctorate in medicine and in 1892 a doctorate in science, from the same institution. Marchal worked for the French government in Paris as an entomologist for the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1894 he became chief-of-staff of the entomology section, and in 1910 he became Director of the entomology station in Paris. In 1898 he started teaching at the Institut national agronomique (National Institute of Agriculture) and in 1900 he was appointed as a professor of applied zoology and agriculture. In 1912, based on the American experience with Novius cardinalis and the earlier work of Raymond Poutiers, he made the first release of acclimatized ladybugs in Europe, in Alpes-Maritimes in southeastern France, for the biological control of cochineal scale. Marchal was a member of the French Academy of Sciences from 1912 until his death in 1942. The standard author abbreviation Marchal is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a zoological name."

  "text" : "Polly Cohen Johnsen is an American film executive and producer. She went to college at the University of California at San Diego, where she majored in Chinese, and is also a graduate of the Peter Stark Producing Program at the University of Southern California. Johnsen began her career working at Warner Bros. in the physical production department while in graduate school. She then became a story editor for producers Stacey Sher and Michael Shamberg at Jersey Films, where she worked on such projects as Gattaca. During her tenure at Jersey Films she teamed up with producer Roy Lee and Glen Gregory of Propaganda Films to create an online tracking board, where script readers could discuss the scripts they read. Online tracking boards have since become a useful tool throughout the film industry. Johnsen re-joined Warner Bros. in 1997 as a creative executive and worked on such movies as Three Kings, The Perfect Storm and Analyze This.She was promoted to production executive in 1998 and then to vice president, production in 1999. In 2003 she was named senior vice president, production and in 2006, executive vice president, production. As an executive, she was noted for recommending the first Harry Potter book for a potential film series, which became one of the studio's most successful franchises of all time. As a senior executive, she oversaw the Harry Potter films, Blood Diamond, I Am Legend, the Scooby Doo series, and Superman Returns, among others. Again in 2006, Johnsen was tapped by former Warner Bros. studio head Jeff Robinov to take over as president of production at Warner Independent Pictures. Among the films she oversaw at the arthouse division were The Painted Veil and Slumdog Millionaire. In 2008, the Hollywood Reporter recognized her on their Power 100 list, as one of the most influential women in Hollywood, and Glamour featured her in their editorial, \"Success Secrets from the Women who Run Hollywood.\" Once Warner Independent Pictures closed in 2008, Johnsen agreed to a first-look producing deal with Warner Bros. under her banner, Polymorphic Pictures. She has since produced Cats and Dogs 2 and Wrath of the Titans for the studio. She also produced Ceremony, written and directed by Max Winkler and starred Uma Thurman and Jake Johnson. In 2013, Johnsen launched mytruestory.com, a website in which writers could share their true stories and Hollywood producers could read them in consideration for potential projects.Johnsen recently served as a panelist at the Shanghai Film Festival and also sits on the USC School of Cinematic Arts Alumni Board.She is married to Robert Johnsen, co-founder of mywedding.com, with whom she has one child."

  "text" : "Peter McLean (September 1837 – 10 December 1924) was a politician in colonial Queensland, Secretary for Public Lands and Mines 1878 to 1879. McLean was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and educated at the Normal School. In 1854 he arrived in Victoria (Australia), and worked on the goldfields until 1862, when he returned to the old country and engaged in agricultural pursuits. His health failing, he went to Queensland in 1865, where he commenced dairying operations. McLean was returned to the Queensland Legislative Assembly on 9 May 1876 for the Electoral district of Logan, and was appointed Secretary for Public Lands and Mines in the Douglas Ministry on 7 December 1878, just six weeks before their defeat. McLean was a prominent advocate of total abstinence in parliament. He was returned three times for Logan, but was defeated in 1883. He thereafter became Inspecting Commissioner of Crown Lands in November 1883, a post which he held until his nomination as Under-Secretary of the newly created Department of Agriculture in July 1887. In March 1889 he received the additional appointment of Curator of Botanic Gardens, Parks, and Preserves. McLean died in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia on 10 December 1924 and was buried in South Brisbane Cemetery."

In April 2012, the Board approved three items proposed by Hantman. She was re-elected for the seventh time in 2013, previously serving in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Her 2010 campaign was met with minor controversy as Ralph Arza was noted being at her headquarters. Arza had previously resigned from the Florida House, in 2006, for sending out expletive-filled threats to another state representative. In 2014, she ran for re-election, and drew a challenger, Duysevi “Sevi” Miyar. The Miami Herald recommended its readers to vote for Hantman for the Miami-Dade School Board. Hantman won the race against Miyar."

  "text" : "Louis-Jacques-Paul Bergon (27 September 1863, in Paris – 27 January 1912) was a French photographer, musician and naturalist. He was a nephew of photographer René Le Bègue (1857–1914). Son of a banker, he was introduced to photography by members of his family circle. Around 1885, he began his career in photography in earnest. He is considered to be an important representative of French pictorialism. A member of the Société française de photographie from 1896, he experimented with color photography at the advent of \"Autochrome Lumière\" (1907). He specialized in photographing nudes. In the field of orchidology, with Edmond Gustave Camus and Aimée Antoinette Camus, he was co-author of \"Monographie des orchidées de l'Europe : de l'Afrique septentrionale, de l'Asie Mineure et des provinces Russes transcaspiennes\" (Monograph of orchids from Europe, northern Africa, Asia Minor and the Russian Trans-Caspian provinces, 1908). His monograph on the diatom genus Entogonia was later translated into English and published with the title \"Diatomaceae : Bergon's monograph on Entogonia : translation into English of descriptions of species and varieties\".

  "text" : "Phyllis Chase, married name Phyllis Samuel (c.1897 – c.1977), was an English illustrator. A schoolfriend of Enid Blyton at St. Christopher's School in Beckenham, Chase and Blyton reunited several years after leaving school at a garden party in 1920 and began collaborating. She is best known for being the illustrator of Blyton initial books such as Child Whispers (1922) and Real Fairies: Poems, but illustrated many of Blyton's short stories which appeared in newspapers and magazines (such as those of publisher Cassell) throughout the 1920s. Chase also illustrated Blyton's Pinkity's Pranks and Other Nature Fairy Tales with A. E. Jackson and The Nursery Book (1927), among many others. She later married Felix Samuel in Sussex, who died in 1967. In 1975 Chase was interviewed on BBC Radio."

  "text" : "Philip Bounds is a Marxist historian, journalist and critic. He holds a PhD in Politics from the University of Wales and has written a number of books, including Orwell and Marxism and British Communism and the Politics of Literature,1928–1939. . Much of Dr Bounds's work is concerned with the intellectual history of the British Left. His book on George Orwell advances the controversial argument that Orwell's literary and cultural criticism was deeply influenced by the work of British communists. The book has been praised for its originality by leading Orwell scholars such as Peter Davison, John Newsinger and Jean-Jacques Rosat. Bounds's most recent book is a memoir of life on the British left entitled Notes from the End of History. Drawing on his own experience of organisations like the Socialist Party of Great Britain and the Communist Party of Britain, Bounds evokes the evolution of the Marxist left over the last thirty years in a style that is simultaneously affectionate and satirical. In her review of the book in the journal New Welsh Review, Helen Pendry described it as \"a romp of a read...politically searching [and] gloriously well written\". A review in the Socialist Standard described it as \"exceptionally well written\" and suggested that \"Bounds wishes to challenge his readers to move beyond the stock-in-trade reformism and sloganeering of the far left\". Philip Bounds has described himself as a \"libertarian Marxist\" and says that his \"enduring belief is that individual liberty can only be achieved in a socialist society\". In some of his writings he has expressed cautious sympathy with free-market libertarians and has written pamphlets for the Libertarian Alliance. He once claimed that \"The great virtue of right-wing libertarians is that they stolidly defend freedom even in the hardest cases.\" Bounds's work on the history of the left has been supplemented by shorter pieces on an eclectic range of subjects, including the music of Pete Townshend, film and the paranormal. He sits on the editorial board of Fifth Estate Online – A Journal of Radical Mass Media Criticism. His articles, reviews and essays have appeared in a range of journals and newspapers including Cultural Logic, Nature, Society and Thought, Critique, Fifth Estate Online, Freedom in a Puritan Age, The Individual, the Morning Star, Weekly Worker and Caravan."

Remember is a career highlight (so far) for DaCunha, as he shares extensive dialogue with Academy Award-winning co-star Christopher Plummer (also a native of Toronto). Plummer advised him that the theater is a good platform for actors to become comfortable with their craft; DaCunha had already taken this step, having worked in theater before moving onscreen. He also participated in the TV Show \"The Reign\" as Prince Charles (Season 1 & 2).He also has a recurring role as Samuel Ramse on Season 2 of the 12 Monkeys television series."

  "text" : "Paul Wilhelm Magnus (29 February 1844, Berlin – 13 March 1914, Berlin) was a German botanist and mycologist. He studied natural sciences at the Universities of Berlin and Freiburg. As a student of Alexander Braun at Berlin, he obtained his PhD in 1870 with a thesis on the aquatic plant genus Najas. In 1875 he became privat-docent at Berlin, where beginning in 1880, he served as an assistant professor of botany. From 1871 to 1874, as a botanist aboard the vessel Pomerania, he conducted investigations of algae found in the North and Baltic Seas as well as in the Schlei estuary. In 1893 he was instrumental in the founding of the Biologische und Fischereistation Müggelsee (presently serving as a measuring station for the Leibniz-Institut für Gewässerökologie und Binnenfischerei). During his career, he analyzed material collected by other botanists, including specimens collected by Joseph Friedrich Nicolaus Bornmüller (Turkey and Syria), Georg Schweinfurth (Eritrea) and Rudolf Marloth (South Africa). Nearly half of his more than 600 works concerned mycological topics, and he is remembered for his investigations of the parasitic fungi families Ustilaginaceae and Uredinaceae. He was responsible for \"Die Pilze (Fungi) von Tirol, Vorarlberg und Liechtenstein\", an 810-page monograph on fungi that was Volume 3 of Dalla Torre and Sarnthein's series on the flora of Tyrol, Vorarlberg and Liechtenstein."

  "text" : "Pepita Ferrari is a Canadian filmmaker. In 1994 she began her long-standing relationship with the National Film Board of Canada, who have produced seven of her films, five of which are available to stream online in both English and French. Her directorial debut By Woman's Hand was a documentary about the Beaver Hall Group, a group of Canadian women painters, who were associated with the Group of Seven. Ferrari focused on the three most prominent artists from the group: Prudence Heward, Sarah Robertson and Anne Savage. Her 2010 documentary Capturing Reality: The Art of Documentary features well-known living documentary filmmakers such as Nick Broomfield, Werner Herzog, Kim Longinotto and Errol Morris watching their own films and discussing the technical and ethical choices that guided their work. The film sets out to answer the question - “What is documentary?” - by taking the viewer through the process of creating a documentary from initial idea to final edit. Since 2009, Ferrari has also written for Point of View, a Canadian magazine about documentary and independent film, published by the Documentary Organization of Canada."

Pope Felix III (13 March 483–492) excommunicated Acacius for his heretical theories. Thus the foundation was laid for the Acacian Schism between the Eastern and Western Christian Churches. Photinus was sent to Pope Anastasius II (496–498), probably by a supporter of Acasius, to plead his case. This Pope was, however, a moderate and tried to resolve the conflict by allowing the heretic deacon, who had been labelled an Acacian by his predecessor Pope Gelasius I, to partake in holy communion. This peace offering did not sway Photinus, but did result in suspicions among certain groups of Christians in the West about the views and opinions of Pope Anastasius. Pope Anastasius died shortly after this visit in 498 and many Christians in the West perceived his death as a sign of God thus deepening the growing divide between the Western and Eastern Christian Churches even further, which resulted in an additional schism, the so-called Laurentian Schism."

As a child she received teachings from her paternal great-aunt Jetsunma Tamdrin Wangmo, her elder brother, her father Kunga Nyingpo Sampel Norbu, and the abbot of Ngor, Ngawang Lodro Nyingpo. She rarely gave public teachings. She did tour eastern Tibet to give and receive teachings, and her main teacher there was Tenpai Wangchuk, who himself was a disciple of her great-aunt Tamdrin Wangmo. She also received Lamdre teachings from Jamyang Loter Wangpo, and gave teachings to the 3rd Dezhung Rinpoche. She was known as a very famous nun who could predict anyone's time of death, and as a powerful medium to the Bamo deities, who were associated with the Khon family (her family). There is a tradition that when she was giving initiations in one of the Sakya monasteries, other monasteries criticized having a woman do this, and they sent some monastic police to beat her; however, she caused an initiation vase to levitate in front of her while she adjusted her robes, and the police prostrated, received blessings from her and left.

  "text" : "Shri. V.T. Prakashan alias Prakash Chennithala (Malayalam:പ്രകാശ് ചെന്നിത്തല) born on 19 May 1967 (Chennithala, Mavelikkara, Kerala, India) is a well known social worker and president of Human Rights Protection Mission.Born and brought up in a small village and a very poor family engaged in agriculture, he had to face many hardships during his upbringing. After completion of his education he started his career in the construction field as a contractor. He continued in this field for 15 years and completed a number of projects in Goa, Karnataka and Kerala and established himself as a well reputed contractor. From childhood he had an instinct to help other's as much as he can. In the year 2002 he came into contact with Sree Matha Sachinmayi Devi Ashram, Chennithala, which was into various kinds of charity activities for the poor. He actively participated in charity work there and as a recognition of his hard work, became the Vice Chairman of Sree Matha Sachinmayi Devi Charitable Trust. During his tenure as Vice Chairman of the Trust he got the opportunity to serve the downtrodden and enjoyed great mental satisfaction. He realized that majority of these poor people are suffering from violations of human rights at different levels and they are unaware about their own rights. He was witness to different occasions of denial of basic rights of people at Government offices, hospitals, police stations etc. The rich and powerful people made the society in such a way that the poor innocent people have to beg for their constitutional human rights. He himself was a victim of denial of basic human rights. Realization of the pathetic condition of the society, he decided to embark upon a journey to make people aware of their basic human rights and started an organization in the name and style of “ Human Rights Protection Mission” in the year 2008. At present, he is the National President of HRPM and under his guidance the organization is actively working for Human Rights awareness among people and helping the poor and needy through charity works. HRPM has its presence in almost all states of India at different levels. Prakash Chennithala has received many honors and awards for his contribution to Human Rights Awareness and Charity Activities."

  "text" : "Peter Suedfeld (born August 30, 1935) is a Canadian/American/Hungarian psychology professor, psychologist, writer, scientist and researcher. With a Ph.D. from Princeton University, Dr. Suedfeld has spent his career studying human beings' reactions to coping with the world around them. He is one of the pioneering researchers in the field of REST (Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy), and was the founding President of IRIS (the International REST Investigators Society). His archival and field research studied the reactions and adaptation of crews in the Antarctic, the Canadian High Arctic, and space vehicles. The findings were among the first to emphasize the positive aspects and consequences of these experiences.

  "text" : "Pierre Frank (24 October 1905, Paris – 18 April 1984, Paris) was a French Trotskyist leader. He served on the secretariat of the Fourth International from 1948 to 1979. Educated as a chemical engineer, Frank was one of the first French Trotskyists, working with surrealist Pierre Naville and the syndicalist Alfred Rosmer. In 1930, he joined Trotsky on the island of Prinkipo to work as a member of the secretariat that prepared the first conference of the International Left Opposition. Returning to France, he was a leader of the Communist League, the French Trotskyist organisation, in the 1930s. After the rise of the 1934 Popular Front government in France, Frank was a part of the faction within the movement led by his friend Raymond Molinier that remained inside the SFIO after the majority followed Trotsky's advice to leave. Frank and his co-thinkers were expelled from the Movement for the Fourth International as a result. Frank was a founder-member of the \"La Commune\" group formed by Molinier. Ernest Mandel comments that the group \"was chiefly identified with a thorough-going preparation of anti-militarist and anti-imperialist work that earned them repression and persecution at the hands of the French imperialist government.\" When the Second World War broke out, Frank was sent to Great Britain in order to continue legally publishing the movement's documents. He issued a publication called International Press Correspondence (Inprecor) but, as an illegal resident, was briefly interned in a British internment camp. Apart from the help of Betty Hamilton, the British Trotskyists were not in sympathy with his views. At the end of the Second World War he returned to France where his current campaigned for the reunification of the French Trotskyists. He joined the leadership of the Internationalist Communist Party (PCI). At the 1948 World Congress he joined the international leadership team that included Ernest Mandel and Michel Pablo. He was important in maintaining the PCI in the 1950s and into the 1960s. He was elected to the United Secretariat of the Fourth International in 1963 and served as an editor of Intercontinental Press. When the PCI was dissolved into the new Communist League in 1968, he was a part of the leadership and continued in it until his death. He was the author of a history of Trotskyism entitled The Long March of the Trotskyists and Histoire de l'Internationale communiste (1919–1943), ed. La Breche, 1979. His ashes are in the Cimetière du Père Lachaise."

He shared the award with Richard Taylor. He was nominated again at the 2012 Academy Awards for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Besides bringing movie characters to life by way of make-up and hairstyling, Peter King, for the 13 dwarves in the movie The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, had to work on 1,000 drawings before finalizing down to a single image. \"We make the prosthetics, wigs, beards and then do a show-and-tell for each character in the film\", was the remark made by Peter about his work. He is credited for his exemplary work of immortalizing characters like the King Kong and Marquis de Sade on celluloid. His other movies include Quills, Thunderbirds Little Voice, The Importance of Being Earnest, An Ideal Husband and The Avengers. King has also won several BAFTA Awards. He has worked on nearly 40 films since 1982. King is artistic director at Bath Academy of Media Makeup, which is a private school for makeup artistry within media and fashion."

  "text" : "Pascal Sebastien Iauko, born 16 May 1986, is a ni-Vanuatu politician. He entered politics at an unexpectedly young age, following the death of his father Harry Iauko, MP for Tanna and Minister for Infrastructure, Public Utilities and Public Service in Prime Minister Sato Kilman's government, on 10 December 2012. Harry Iauko's death led to a by-election for his seat in Parliament. By the time the election was held on May 27, the Kilman government had lost its majority in Parliament and resigned; Moana Carcasses (of the Green Confederation) was the new Prime Minister, leading a broad coalition government. In the by-election, Pascal Iauko stood as the candidate of the Iauko Group, a small political movement which had been headed by his father, after his break-away from the Vanua'aku Pati. Parties within the Opposition coalition tacitly endorsed him and did not stand against him, while the main parties within the coalition government each stood a candidate. Thus, \"the seat was contested by almost a united opposition against a divided government side\". Iauko's youth and \"quiet demeanour\" were commented upon, but he was also endorsed by local elders. His father, despite having been a highly controversial figure, convicted in 2011 for aiding and abetting intentional assault (having supervised the beating up of a journalist who had criticised him), had remained popular on Tanna, where there remained a strong tradition of handing on leadership positions to family members of deceased leaders. Pascal Iauko, at the age of just 27, was elected in a landslide victory, with the largest vote tally in the country's history. He secured 4,017 votes, a record, corresponding to 32% of the vote, with a record lead of 1,341 votes (10.7%) over his closest opponent, and joined the Opposition benches. In October 2013, the Iauko Group, under the leadership of Tony Nari, merged back into the Vanua'aku Pati, and joined Prime Minister Carcasses' parliamentary majority. From then on, Pascal Iauko sat as a Vanua'aku Pati government backbencher. On 22 October 2015, he was found guilty of bribery, was sentenced to three years in prison, and lost his seat in Parliament."

  "text" : "Paul Farwell Keene Jr. (24 August 1920 – 26 November 2009) was a Philadelphia-area artist and teacher whose work helped raise the visibility of Black American artists. As a self-described “abstract realist,” his story reflects both the accomplishments and the difficulties of African American artists in the 20th century. Keene was born in Philadelphia and died in Warrington, PA. He earned a reputation at a time when that was exceedingly difficult for artists of his race. He earned three degrees (B.F.A., B.Sc.Ed., and M.F.A.) and taught at Temple University’s Tyler School of Art and the Philadelphia College of Art. He was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. During World War II, Keene enlisted in the Air Force. He attained the rank of lieutenant and served with the Tuskegee Airmen in the 332nd Fighter Group. He used the GI Bill to study at the Academie Julian in Paris. While there, he helped found Gallerie 8, a collective gallery for American artists working in Paris. Keene exhibited with Picasso and Leger at the Salon de Mai and through Whitney Fellowships directed courses at the Centre D'Art, Port-au-Prince, Haiti between 1952 and 1954. When Keene returned to the United States he began work as an associate professor at the Philadelphia College of Art. He later left for a professorship at Bucks County Community College (BCCC) in Newtown, Pennsylvania, where he helped to establish a new art department. Keene retired from teaching in 1985. He was the son of Paul F. Keene Sr and Josephine Hebron, co-founder of the National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women’s Clubs, Incorporated. He married Laura Mitchell and they had a son and a daughter."

  "text" : "Patrick Boyce Coglin (15 January 1815 – 22 July 1892) was a businessman and politician in the early days of South Australia. Coglin was born at Ballynote, in the county of Sligo to an old and honorable family. His uncle, Dr. Boyce, of Tullamore, county Roscommon, was a noted horse breeder. In 1831 he, his parents, brothers and sisters sailed for Tasmania in the Lindsay, captain Fenton, arriving in Hobart on 24 June. After completing his education in Hobart he was articled to Mr. Biggins, a prominent architect and builder. In 1836 or 1837 he left in the Lady Liverpool for South Australia, where he was married. Shortly after his arrival he purchased from Charles Beaumont Howard, the Colonial Chaplain, land in Hindley Street and opened a timber-yard, which developed into a flourishing business, bringing in Tasmanian timber, and when the Burra mines were opened up he purchased the site upon which the Napoleon and Royal Exchange Hotels later stood, to cope with the expanded business. He built the first Napoleon Hotel, and was its landlord for many years. He purchased more land about the corner of Waymouth and King William Streets, which he later sold at a great profit. He invested in pastoral properties, in which he was equally successful. About 1877 he purchased a section of land adjoining Brompton and laid it out as a township, giving it the name of Brompton Park, where resided until his death. Coglin Street is a major thoroughfare in this area."

He visited England and became friends with Robert Stephenson, with whom he surveyed a route for a Suez Canal in 1847. The French Revolution of 1848 was followed by a financial crisis, and Talabot formed a company in 1852 to take over the struggling railway between Lyon and the Mediterranean; this merged with the Paris to Lyon Railway in 1857 to become the Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée. In 1862 Talabot became its first Director General and he died on 21 March 1885."

  "text" : "Ketevan (Georgian: ქეთევანი, Persian: کتایون‎, translit. Katāyūn‎; fl. 1737) was a Georgian princess royal (batonishvili) of the Bagrationi dynasty. She was a daughter of Teimuraz II and sister of Heraclius II and married the Afsharid Iranian royal Adil Shah (Ali-qoli Khan) in 1737. Ketevan was the eldest daughter of Teimuraz, of the royal house of Kakheti, by his second wife, Princess Tamar of Kartli. Teimuraz, then at war to secure his throne, was summoned by his suzerain Nader Shah, the Afsharid ruler of Iran, in 1737. In a show of loyalty, Teimuraz had to agree on Nader's terms, which included the marriage of Teimuraz's daughter Ketevan to Nader's nephew Ali-qoli Khan and summoning his son Heraclius to join Nader's campaign to India, the deal which Teimuraz would lament in his autobiographical poem. The marriage was celebrated at Mashhad, attended by Teimuraz and his entourage of 2,500. Ketevan's subsequent fate is unknown. Her husband, Ali-qoli Khan, maintained friendly relations with Teimuraz and the Georgians. He relied on Sohrab Khan, a vizier of Georgian background, and exchanged gifts with his father-in-law during his brief reign over the crumbling Afsharid empire as Adil Shah from 1747 to 1748. Adil Shah was overthrown by his brother Ebrahim Khan and killed in 1749."

Dadd studied at the Slade School of Fine Art 1900 to 1903, and he became a staff artist at The Sphere magazine. He illustrated the 1904 book William Tell Told Again by P. G. Wodehouse, accompanied by verses written by John W. Houghton. His work was included in several public exhibitions before 1914, at the Royal Academy, Brook Street Art Gallery, the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. After the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted in December 1915 as a private in the 16th (County of London) Battalion, the London Regiment (Queen's Westminster Rifles). He served on the Western Front in France. On 12 August 1916, Dadd's illustration of a British gas sentry ringing a medieval church bell to alert troops of a German gas attack appeared on the cover of The Sphere. The illustration had been published posthumously: Dadd was killed in France on 2 August 1916. He is buried in the Maroeuil British Cemetery near Arras."

To quote co-author of \"The Great American Pin-Up\", Louis K. Meisel; \"Frush's technical brilliance was such that, upon close examination, her works even begin to take on a photographic clarity. Those knowledgeable collectors who have studied her paintings have often judged her the equal of Alberto Vargas in artistic excellence.\"  She sometimes signed her paintings with her [then] married names; \"Pearl Frush-Brudon\", or \"Pearl Mann\". One of her most recognizable and enduring contributions to American Advertising Iconography was her original rendering of Little Debbie® McKee, for McKee Foods in 1960."

He lived in Berlin-Lankwitz, Germany. In 1866 he imported the first goldfish (Carassius auratus) to Germany from Japan, and the offspring were referred to as the \"Matte-strain\". He was the first to breed the Paradise fish and Siamese fighting fish in Germany. In 1896 he imported ten pairs of Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) to Germany from Moscow, from the strain bred by Pierre Carbonnier in France. In 1897 he imported and bred the first specimens of the banded gourami (Trichogaster fasciata) to Europe. In 1905 he imported the first zebrafish (Danio rerio) to Europe. Matte was the first to import both sexes of swordtail (Xiphophorus hellerii). The characin Hemigrammus matei is named after Paul Matte, since he delivered the first specimens to the author Carl H. Eigenmann, who described the species in 1918."

His other works include Akasathinte Veru, Uyarthezhunnelppu, Thalappoli and Kavalkkarante Pattu. He also worked as the programme executive in All India Radio. Among contemporary Malayalam poets P.P. Sreedharanunni has acquired a space which is both prominent and unpredictable. By not falling in line with any of the currently popular trends of Malayalam poetry his art exhibits bold isolation. At the same time he draws strength from the history of Malayalam versification, from the classical down to the post-modern age. His poetry manifests itself as an elusive mosaic made of myths and urban images, of plain narrative lores turning into formidable riddles, and of silken romanticism in strange company with post modern meta-narratives. When his poetic career started critics soon identified him as a later-romantic. But this rather pejorative label soon proved insufficient to explain his poetry as the poet exhibited growth in multiple directions. Today, he remains an important figure in the contemporary Malayalam poetry."

Over the next five years he became ambassador to eleven European countries and the United States of America. King Rama V asked Prince Prisdang his opinion on how to deal with European countries hunting for new colonies. In response Prince Prisdang and his associates penned a draft democratic constitution which stipulated that the monarchy be subject to constitutional law and that there be a cabinet. Siam was not yet ready for such radical a change and the prince was recalled to Bangkok where he worked as a civil servant until 1890. He then went to India to become a Buddhist monk under the name of Jinavarawansa. On his pilgrimge to the northern border with Nepal he came across the bones of the Lord Buddha complete with inscriptions dug up by Mr. Peppé, the English land owner. Through his intercession, the Vice Roy of India agreed to place the relics under the care of King Chulalongkorn of Siam. The prince became the Buddhist patriarch of Colombo, Sri Lanka, but returned to Bangkok in 1911 where he was obliged to disrobe and lived in poverty until his death in 1935."
