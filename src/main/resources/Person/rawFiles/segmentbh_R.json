During the Anglo-Spanish War (1654–60), he won renown and a fortune in prize money when he captured great part of Spanish West Indian treasure fleet off Cadiz in 1656. He was knighted by the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell for services in Admiral Robert Blake's destruction of Spanish ships at Santa Cruz, 1667. He was a rear-admiral of the fleet which brought Charles II to England in 1660. He was again knighted at the Restoration. He died at Lisbon, while serving as vice-admiral of Mediterranean fleet."

  "text" : "Ryan Noah Shapiro (born 1976) is a doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Doctoral Program in History, Anthropology, Science, Technology, and Society (HASTS), a U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) researcher, and an advocate for animal rights. Shapiro's baccalaureate and graduate studies have dealt extensively with the history of vegetarianism and the animal rights movement. His first publication was an in-depth review of James Gregory's seminal \"Of Victorians and Vegetarians: The Vegetarian Movement In Nineteenth-Century Britain\". His forthcoming doctoral dissertation is titled \"Bodies at War: Animals, The Freedom of Science, and National Security in the United States, 1899-1979\" and will focus on the conflict between ethical concerns over animal rights and U.S. national security concerns. In addition to the dissertation, he is also developing a historical map of how the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has handled the animal rights movement. Both projects rely on large amounts of information that, while not necessarily classified, is usually only be made public once formally requested under the Freedom of Information Act. When agencies of the U.S. Government have refused to process those requests or provided data that is highly redacted or otherwise manipulated, Shapiro has pursued repeated litigation that has been widely publicized. Shapiro is regarded by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) as the \"most prolific\" FOIA requester, and the FBI has claimed that his requests for information through the FOIA are \"irreparably damag[ing] to national security.\""

  "text" : "In international trade law, Bhala’s Stare Decisis Trilogy was the first to highlight that, in practice, the doctrine of precedent operates in multilateral trade adjudication. His Doha Round Trilogy pointed out that the detailed negotiating texts of the round had deviated from a key original purpose of the round: re-writing trade rules to help alleviate poverty, and thereby reduce the vulnerability of marginalized populations to Islamist extremist ideologies. Bhala’s articles appear in general and international law reviews, and five are in The International Lawyer, the award-winning, peer-reviewed journal of the American Bar Association (ABA) Section of International Law, which circulates worldwide to over 15,000 readers. The Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law publishes the annual WTO Case Review, which Bhala co-authored since its inception in 2000. Bhala authored Modern GATT Law, the first major treatise on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade since the 1970 publication of The Law of the GATT (Kenneth W. Dam) and 1969 publication of World Trade and the Law of GATT (John H. Jackson). The Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) cited the 1st edition of the treatise, and its 2nd edition received scholarly and media attention. He also has authored the textbook International Trade Law, which has been cited by United States federal courts, and portions of this text were translated into Vietnamese. The latest edition, with the sub-title \"An Interdisciplinary, Non-Western Textbook,\" is in two volumes, has been endorsed by 19 trade experts in 10 different countries, including Columbia University Professor Jagdish Bhagwati and Texas A&M President Michael Young, and been profiled in the media. Bhala’s monograph Trade, Development, and Social Justice, applies Catholic social justice theory to special and differential treatment rules of the multilateral trading system. In Islamic Law, Bhala became the first non-Muslim American law professor to produce a textbook on the subject designed for English-speaking law students, teachers, and practitioners (Understanding Islamic Law (Shari’a)). He has spoken out against state anti-Sharia legislation, arguing it is unfair and bad for business. The textbook has received media attention, such as after the November 2015 Paris attacks, and has been reviewed as a \"brilliant and much-needed resource\". It is in its second edition. Some of Bhala’s research is at the intersection of International Trade and Islamic Law. One article analyzes the tariff schedules of every Islamic country in the world, and points out few such countries use the GATT Article XX(a) public morality exception to ban importation of products, such as alcohol and pork, the consumption of which the Sharia forbids. Like non-Islamic countries, most of them impose tariffs on these products, possibly for moral, secularist, legal, or economic reasons. Other areas of Bhala’s research are the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Indian trade law and policy. His book TPP Objectively examines the legal, economic, and national security aspects of TPP, arguing the deal merits a grade of “B,” and calls for stronger provisions to benefit women and their extension to the LGBTQ community. Via scholarly presentations and media appearances in India, he urged India to consider joining TPP. Speaking in Riyadh at the Council of Saudi Chambers of Commerce and Harvard Alumni Association of Saudi Arabia (HASA) in April 2015, he discussed reorienting Saudi trade law and policy toward the Asia-Pacific region. He addressed the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Law Association of Malaysia, and justices from the Supreme and High Courts of Malaysia, in April 2016 on the topic of Risks and Opportunities with the Trans-Pacific Partnership for Malaysia."

  "text" : "Robert Spankie (17 April 1774 – 2 November 1842) was a Scottish-born journalist, barrister and politician who spent most of his career and life in England and India. Born in Falkland, Fife, he was the son of a Church of Scotland Minister. He entered the University of St Andrews but left without graduating, moving to London in about 1792. He became a reporter for the Morning Chronicle rising to be the editor. In 1803 he left journalism and became a law student at the Inner Temple in 1803, and was called to the bar in 1808. Following his marriage to Euphemia Inglis, daughter of an East India Company director in 1813, he pursued a legal career in India. In 1817 he became Advocate-General of Bengal. He returned to England in 1823 due to illness. He resumed his legal practice from his home in Russell Square, London, and became a serjeant-at-law in 1824 and a king's serjeant in 1832. At the 1832 general election Spankie was elected as one of two members of parliament for the new London constituency of Finsbury, enfranchised under the Reform Act 1832. Elected as Liberal, in parliament he took a distinctly Conservative line, leading to his defeat at the next election in 1835. He subsequently stood as a Conservative candidate at Bury in 1837 without success. He continued his legal practice, becoming standing counsel for the East India Company. He died at his London home in 1842 aged 68."

He is the author of several books, including Reflections on Frege's Philosophy (1969), Meinong (1974), and Phenomenology and Existentialism (1984). Grossmann has developed a neo-Kantian epistemology according to which what passes for reality is determined by an intellectual categorical framework. He has expounded it in The Structure of Mind (1965) and The Categorical Structure of the World (1983)."

Marks and members of her extended family operated multiple storefront businesses, four in Broward County, Florida one of which was in Fort Lauderdale, named \"Astrology Life\" and one in Manhattan on W. 58th Street near Central Park. They told vulnerable clients that the only solution to their problems was to give the purported psychics money. Prior to this case there was doubt that a psychic could be criminally charged. Jurors were told that fortune-telling is constitutionally protected free speech, but federal prosecutors contended Marks engaged in fraud by promising to keep clients money safe, \"cleanse\" it and return it when she had no intention of returning it. The case drew widespread coverage. Charles Stack, a retired Fort Lauderdale police detective, said the case and the ensuing publicity brought attention to predatory and fraudulent fortune tellers. The family amassed a fortune estimated at between $25 and $40 million. Defense attorney Fred Schwartz said the federal government seized Marks' family assets including cars, motorcycles, a boat, gold, jewelry and a home near the Intracoastal Waterway. In 2014, Marks was sentenced over 10 years in prison for defrauding clients of her family's fortune-telling businesses out of more than $17.8 million."

Burrowes was returned to the Victorian Assembly for Sandhurst in January 1866, and held the seat till his defeat in May 1877. In May 1880 he was re-elected, and held the seat until his death on 16 September 1893. From August 1881 to March 1883 he was Minister of Mines in the O'Loghlen Government.

  "text" : "Roland Stone (born Roland LeBlanc, 12 August 1941 – 22 December 1999) was an American rhythm and blues and pop singer who performed and recorded in New Orleans between the 1950s and 1990s. Singer Aaron Neville described him as \"the singingest white guy I've ever heard\". He was born in New Orleans, and in his teens played guitar in a Warren Easton High School band, The Jokers. In 1959 he was invited by Mac Rebennack (later known as Dr. John) to join his group, The Skyliners. He won a contract with Ace Records, but made his first recording, a version of the song \"Junco Partner\" re-worked as \"Preacher's Daughter\", for the Spinett label, set up by singer Frankie Ford and his manager Joe Caronna. For contractual reasons Caronna changed the singer's name to Stone. At the Ace label, he then recorded \"Something Special\", which was written and produced by Rebennack, and arranged by Allen Toussaint. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Another was \"Just A Moment\", which became a regional hit and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. However, later records in the early 1960s, some released on Cosimo Matassa's White Cliffs label, failed to sell. In 1964, Stone quit the music business. He worked in New Orleans and then Texas – where he performed occasionally under his real name until the late 1970s – before returning to his home city in 1979 to work in his uncle's dry cleaning business. Following an approach from record producer Carlo Ditta, he recorded again with Dr. John in the 1990s, releasing two albums on Orleans Records, Remember Me (1994) and Live on the Creole Queen (1997). He also performed at local clubs and festivals, while working with his brother in a galvanized metal company. A compilation of his Ace recordings was issued in the UK in 1999. He died in New Orleans that year at the age of 58."

Byrne was born in Waterford, Ireland, the son of Robert Byrne. He left Ireland for New York City in 1848, and settled there, carrying on the business of general auctioneer in that city as well as in Boston. Towards the end of 1852 he left America for Victoria, arriving in Melbourne In February 1853, He commenced auctioneering at Sandridge, now called Port Melbourne, and represented the district in the Melbourne Corporation prior to its being constituted a separate municipality. At the general election of 1864 Byrne contested Sandridge for a seat in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in the Liberal interest against the Hon. David Moore, but was defeated by three votes, and was unsuccessful on petition. Shortly afterwards he was returned for Crowlands by a very large majority. In 1869, when Sir James McCulloch went outside the House for a Commissioner of Customs, Byrne carried a motion censuring the Government, which was taken by them as a vote of want of confidence, on which they resigned, a new Ministry being formed on 20 September 1869, with the Hon. John Alexander MacPherson as Chief Secretary and Byrne as Treasurer. When, however, the latter sought re-election at the hands of his constituents, he was defeated by George Rolfe, the gentleman to whose appointment he had objected, and retired from office on 21 January 1870, being succeeded by Graham Berry. Byrne did not re-entered public life unsuccessfully contesting the upper house seats of Central Province in 1878, Melbourne Province in 1888, and the lower house seat of Avoca in 1880. Byrne died in Richmond, Victoria on 24 March 1909 aged 88 years, survived by three daughters."

  "text" : "Raymond Barkway (1924–1956) ran the 110M high hurdles for Great Britain in the 1948 London Olympics. He was killed in a plane crash he was piloting aged only 32 years old. Barkway was born in Croxley Green and began his athletics career at Harrow County High school. After his father got the job of station master on the Watford metropolitan line the family moved into the station house on Cassiobury park avenue, and the young Barkway arrived at Watford Boys Grammar School in 1937. He went on to win a place at Exeter College, Oxford to read Chemistry. Whilst at Oxford he became one of the country’s top high hurdlers. He recorded his lifetime best of 14.9s in 1950. A fine victory in the South of England champs in the same year saw him take the victory by less than a foot between all 3 medalists. Barkway went out in the heats in London 1948, placing 4th in a time of 15.3s although he did go onto win a medal on the world stage when in 1951 he took the bronze medal in the Summer International University Sports Week held in Luxemburg. An event now referred to as the World Student Games, he finished in a time of 15.5s. During his time at Exeter college he befriended and trained alongside Roger Bannister and was the official starter for Bannisters 4 minute mile record breaking run on 6 May 1954. The silver Smith & Wesson revolver used by Barkway is now on display at Clifton College in Bristol, where Barkway worked as Chemistry teacher upon finishing his studies at Oxford.A member of the RAF reserve, and later the Naval Reserve, he reached the rank of Lieutenant and traveled to Canada where he underwent elementary pilot training. By coincidence he was taught his flying skills by the son of his former Maths teacher at Watford Boys. On 1 July 1956, Barkway was on flying exercises at Tilstock Airfield near Whitchurch, Shropshire. The Grumman TBM-3E Avenger he was piloting crashed and killed both Barkway, and his co-pilot. The inquest into the crash found that the engine failed during a steep turn due to a loose nut in the carburetor. His obituary in the Watford Boys Fullerian journal at that time read he took a \"fierce pride in his old school which he would allow to take no second place in comparison with any other\". He had only recently turned 32 years old at the time of his death."

  "text" : "Richard Greeff (14 March 1829, Elberfeld – 30 August 1892, Marburg) was a German zoologist. He studied medicine in Würzburg, Heidelberg and Berlin, receiving his medical doctorate in 1857. Following graduation, he worked as a hospital assistant in Danzig, returning to Elberfeld in 1859 as a physician. Soon afterwards he quit his medical practice in favor of zoological research, subsequently obtaining his habilitation for zoology at the University of Bonn in 1863. In 1871 he succeeded Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Claus as professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Marburg. He traveled extensively during his career, conducting zoological investigations in Portugal, the Adriatic Coast, the African tropics and the Canary Islands. Inspired by the work of Bonn professor Max Schultze, he focused his attention on the anatomical construction and reproductive behaviour of protozoa, especially Rhizopoda. He also made significant contributions in his research of annelids and echinoderms. The nematode genus Greeffiella is named after him, as are species with the epithet of greeffii, e.g. Acinetoides greeffii. A species of gecko, Hemidactylus greeffii, was named in his honor in 1886 by Portuguese zoologist José Vicente Barbosa du Bocage."

He founded the Mount Cook Group of tourism and transport companies, which were taken over by his son Henry Wigley. He was a son of Thomas Henry Wigley, MLC and sheep-farmer. His first business in 1904 was \"Wigley and Thornton\" which transported wool from South Canterbury sheep stations to Timaru using steam traction engines. In 1906 he purchased a 6 hp De Dion car and drove it to The Hermitage hotel near Mount Cook; and subsequently dissolved his first firm and formed the \"Mount Cook Motor Co Ltd\" with four Darraq cars to provide transport for tourists to The Hermitage and from 1912 Queenstown also. When the Lakes County Council tried to stop motor cars on the Queenstown route by banning any vehicle propelled by its own power from a critical two mile stretch, he hired men with horses to pull the cars with passengers over the section. After the Great War he purchased five war surplus British aircraft and formed \"The New Zealand Aero Transport Co\" in 1921, the precursor to Mount Cook Airline. He was also a notable mountaineer, making the first ascent of Mount Cook in mid-winter with two guides, on 11–12 August 1923."

During the opening stages War of the Two Kings Kingston took command of the Protestant forces raised in Sligo in defiance of James II. Following a series of defeats for the Protestants in Eastern Ulster, it was decided to abandon Sligo and withdraw towards Ballyshannon. During their march his men fought a skirmish with a force of Irish Army troops under Sir Connell Ferrall near Bundoran, driving them off and safely reaching Ballyshannon. Kingston garrisoned Ballyshannon but, after receiving orders from his superior Robert Lundy at Derry following the Protestant defeat at the Battle of Cladyford, he disbanded his forces and departed for Scotland. Most of troops went to Enniskillen where they took part in the successful defence of the town."

Webster was born in Tiffin, Ohio and educated in Pennsylvania. He served in the United States Navy during World War II. Webster applied to Rand Development in November 1957 to work as a plastics chemist. In 1959 Webster travelled several times to Moscow for Rand to prepare for the American Exhibition there. During a seven-week stay beginning in May 1959, Webster began dating a waitress at the Hotel Ukraine, who is suspected of being a KGB agent. On July 11, 1959 Webster approached Soviet officials at the exhibition to ask about procedures for a US citizen to remain in the Soviet Union. After several further meetings, including one in which Webster told two Soviet scientists he could help them duplicate the Rand spray gun on show in the exhibition, he was accepted by the Soviets, although posted to work in Leningrad rather than Moscow as he had asked. On October 17 he attended the US Embassy in Moscow (having already sent a postcard), meeting with Richard Edward Snyder. He filled in a \"Affidavit for Expatriated Person\" form and wrote a resignation letter to Rand. He had left his wife and two children behind. On January 27, 1960 Webster received a letter from his father stating that his mother had had a nervous breakdown and that he had assumed financial support for Webster's children. Webster then decided to return to the US, asking the US Embassy in Moscow in May 1960 how to do so. He was told to apply for a Soviet exit visa, which he did, but was turned down, and that he could not reapply for a year. Reapplying a year later, he was granted an exit visa in February 1962, and returned to the US on 20 May, classified as an alien. He left behind his Soviet girlfriend and the daughter he had with her. On his return, James H. Rand, III, President of Rand Development, said he \"felt a responsibility\" for Webster and would help him to secure employment (though not at Rand). A World War 2 Veteran, Robert Edward Webster died in Fall River, Massachusetts within Bristol County, Massachusetts on Veterans Day November 11, 1999; he is buried at the Pine Grove Cemetery, New Bedford, Massachusetts within Bristol County, Massachusetts."

In 2009 she joined the group MADmoiselle, which released one digital single before disbanding. Nine years after her debut, in 2010, she made her comeback as a solo artist, under the stage name Rottyful Sky, with the release of the digital single \"No Way (Rottyful Sky song)\". At that time, she became the first singer to be produced by actor-singer Ryu Si-won. On June 24, 2010, Sony MUSIC launch the first Korean video of \"No way\" in 3D.

  "text" : "Robert Wayne Bates, I (born May 1941), is an horticultural nurseryman in Forest Hill in south Rapides Parish, Louisiana, who was an agent of the United States Secret Service under U.S. Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, and Gerald R. Ford, Jr. He also provided security for Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, former First Lady Mamie Eisenhower and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Bates was reared by a single mother in \"a shotgun house with a dirt-floored kitchen.\" He graduated from Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana. In 1965, he joined the Secret Service and was posted at the White House. He provided security for the Johnson and Nixon daughters while they were college students. He was with Nixon in the 1972 trip to China. He ended his Secret Service career in 1976 as the agent in charge in the field office in Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. Bates described the people he protected as \"just people, like you and me\" who obtain high political office and must provide for the security of the nation. After his eleven years in the Secret Service, Bates relocated to Forest Hill, where he operates Robert Bates Nursery, in the commercial nursery complex south of Alexandria.  One of Bates' fellow nurserymen in Forest Hill is Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Clyde C. Holloway, a Republican who held Louisiana's 8th congressional district seat from 1987 to 1993, since disbanded. On November 16, 1991, Bates was the Republican candidate for the District 29 seat in the Louisiana State Senate. He lost to the incumbent Democrat Joe McPherson, then of Pineville. McPherson received 23,428 votes (56.8 percent) to Bates' 17,819 (43.2 percent).Three other Democratic candidates, including state Representative Charles R. Herring of Alexandria and singer Jay Chevalier, had been eliminated in the primary election held earlier on October 19. In 2005, Bates was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. Holloway, who defeated Joe McPherson in 2009 for Holloway's current seat on the Public Service Commission, has not been inducted into the Hall of Fame."

  "text" : "(Mary) Rosalie Glynn Grylls (13 April 1905 – 2 November 1988), was a British biographer, lecturer and Liberal Party politician. In 1945 she became known as Lady Mander. She was the daughter of Archibald Campbell Glynn Grylls of Cornwall; the family had been established in the county for centuries. She was educated at Queen's College, London and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford where she graduated with a Master of Arts. She married, in November 1930, Geoffrey Mander MP for East Wolverhampton. She was his second wife. They had one son and one daughter. In 1929 she was employed as Secretary to the Liberal MP Edgar Granville. In July 1930 she was selected as Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate for the Reading Division of Berkshire for the General Election that was to occur in 1931. In November 1930 she married Liberal MP Geoffrey Mander at a ceremony at the House of Commons where Granville was Mander's best man. By the time the General Election came, a National Government had been formed and the Reading Liberals did not contest the constituency. Although she remained interested in politics, she did not attempt to stand again for public office and instead concentrated on her writing. She was a noted biographer with a special interest in the writers and artists of the Romantic period and an early connoisseur of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Her biographical subjects included Mary Shelley (1938), Claire Clairmont (1939), Edward John Trelawny (1950), William Godwin (1953), Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1965), Ivy Compton-Burnett (1971) and Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1980). She was influential in the overdue reassessment of the artists and writers of the Victorian period. She lectured frequently in the USA."

His mother was the daughter of David Charles of Carmarthen, a pioneer of the Calvinistic Methodist denomination in Wales. Davies's status within his denomination was further strengthened by his marriage in 1863 to Frances Humphreys of Llandyfaelog, Carmarthenshire, who was the great granddaughter of Peter Williams. Peter Williams had been responsible for one of the most popular editions of the Welsh language Bible in the late eighteenth century. In 1873 Davies became treasurer of the Calvinistic Methodist General Assembly."

  "text" : "Railway historian Ron Ziel was born July 17, 1939 in Manhattan. His family moved to eastern Queens in 1942, and eventually settled in Melville in 1949. He first became interested in railroads as a small child, when his mother would take him to watch the trains at the Long Island Rail Road stations at Queens Village and Bellerose. He attended Huntington High School, graduating in 1957, and studied advertising design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, earning a BFA in 1961. He first began photographing steam locomotives at Brooklyn’s Eastern District Terminal in the fall of 1960. According to Mr. Ziel, these were the last steam locomotives to be used in freight service in the state of New York. While at Pratt Mr. Ziel joined the ROTC, and upon graduation received a commission as a reserve second lieutenant in the United States Army. He served in the Army Signal Corps, stationed at Fort Gordon, Georgia, from September, 1961 to January, 1962, when he was given a medical discharge because of a diabetic condition. While stationed at Fort Gordon, Mr. Ziel began photographing steam locomotives in the southern United States. Eventually these photographs were included in his first book, “Twilight of Steam”, published by Grosset and Dunlap in 1963. He has since written ten more books, including five about the Long Island Rail Road, and has also contributed articles and photographs to Railroad Magazine, Railfan and Railroad, and Trains Magazine. He also served as executive editor for Dan’s Newspapers, a chain of community newspapers serving the East End of Long Island, in addition to working as a writer and staff photographer for those publications. In 1965, Mr. Ziel and his longtime collaborator George Foster published the book “Steel Rails to the Sunrise”. In the course of researching the book they met numerous railroad historians and photographers on Long Island, an experience that led them to form a Long Island chapter of the National Railway Historical Society. The Long Island-Sunrise Trail Chapter was chartered in 1966, with Mr. Ziel serving as its first president, an office he held until 1969. Other founding members included Winfield S. Boerckel, F. Rodney Dirkes, Harold Fagerberg, Arthur J. Huneke and Robert Michel. Mr. Ziel was also the founder and first president of the Steam Locomotive 39 Preservation Fund, which was responsible for refurbishing LIRR Engine #39 and moving it from the Carriage House Museum in Stony Brook to a new location in Riverhead. Throughout his life Mr. Ziel has traveled to over fifty countries and has, by his own estimate, taken over twenty five thousand photographs of steam locomotives in regular service. In April 2005 Mr. Ziel moved from his long-time home in Water Mill, Long Island to Tucson, Arizona, where he currently resides. In 2008, the Archives at Queens Library purchased Mr. Ziel's collection of Long Island photographs. This collection includes both Mr. Ziel's own photographs, as well as images by other photographers that Mr. Ziel collected. While it takes as its major subject the history of the Long Island Rail Road (and to a lesser extent its parent company, the Pennsylvania Railroad), the collection also includes many photographs documenting subways, buses, trolley lines and other forms of mass transit in Brooklyn, Queens and suburban Long Island, as well as views of boats, docks, lighthouses, residences and many other subjects relating to the history of Long Island."

  "text" : "Reginald Beaumont Heygate (13 May 1883, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire – 24 April 1956, Crieff, Scotland) was an English cricketer who appeared in 73 first-class matches from 1902 to 1904 and 1909 to 1911 as a right-handed batsman who scored 2,818 runs with a highest score of 136 and took four wickets with a best performance of two for 21. Heygate played for Epsom College between 1898 and 1901. In his last season at school Heygate scored 599 runs in nine innings (two not out) at an average of 85.57, which was regarded as exceptional given his limited support despite the fact that Epsom never played the strongest cricket schools. For 1902, Heygate was sought after by both Sussex and W.G. Grace’s London County team, but he played only ten matches, all for Sussex in May and August. Only with an innings of 95 against Gloucestershire did Heygate live up to his Epson form, and he had a very modest average of 16.06 from seventeen innings. In 1903 on his sole appearance for London County, Heygate played a fine innings of 61 not out to help Sussex teammate Ranjitsinhji orchestrate an unlikely victory over MCC and averaged 27 for ten innings in a very wet summer for Sussex despite playing no innings higher than 55. In 1904, Heygate was disappointing apart from a score of 72 at The Oval, and owing to medical duties he was not seen even once in first-class cricket between 1905 and 1908, yet in 1909 and 1910 Reginald Heygate managed to spare the time to play a full season for Sussex. In each of those two years he scored just over a thousand runs, despite both summers being wet and unfavourable to Heygate’s style, which depended upon hard hitting in front of the wicket to an extent considered \"old-fashioned\" by contemporary observers. Heygate’s moderate defence on the sticky wickets common in his two full seasons explains why he failed in his one appearance for the Gentlemen on a Lord’s wicket where shooters were more common at Lord's than at any time since the heavy roller was introduced in the 1870s. The hot and dry 1911 season, which would have suited his style much better, saw Heygate’s work as a doctor take up more of his time, and he could play only twice that season and not at all subsequently. He did however continue to play regularly for the Winsborough Green club until 1918, and was that club’s president until 1932. Following his retirement from county cricket, Heygate moved to Scotland where he practised as a doctor until his death in 1956."

  "text" : "Richard Lee Stalder (born March 23, 1951) is the former secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections, a position to which he was appointed in 1992 by then Governor Edwin W. Edwards. The position is now held by James M. LeBlanc, Stalder's former colleague. Stalder is one of four children of Edgar A. Stalder, who died on his 92nd birthday on December 13, 2015, and the former Mildred A. Strahm (also born 1923) of Topeka, Kansas. Edgar Stalder was reared on a farm along the Kansas-Nebraska border. After distinguished service under General George S. Patton, with the United States Army in World War II. He received the Silver Star, was recognized by the historian Stephen E. Ambrose with the placing of Stalder's war memoir at both the Eisenhower Center of the University of New Orleans and in the National World War II Museum in Washington, D.C., he worked for the United States Department of Agriculture in New Orleans and later Washington, D.C. Richard Stalder has three siblings, Robert Stalder and his wife, Pattie, of Westmoreland, Kansas; Ronald Stalder of Austin, Texas, and Susan Brinker and her husband, Brian, of Stillwater, Oklahoma. In 1971, Richard Stalder began working as a prison officer to earn money while he was attending Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He worked his way to the positions of federal programs administrator, corrections budget officer, and the superintendent of Louisiana Training Institute in Monroe, Louisiana, deputy warden of Dixon Correctional Institute in Jackson, Louisiana, and warden of David Wade Correctional Center in Homer. in Claiborne Parish, named for the late American general David Wade. From 1998 to 2000, Stalder was the president of the American Correctional Association. Stalder was the choice of a new group founded in 1991 and known as Louisiana Wardens and Superintendent (LAWS) to head the corrections agency. The driving force behind LAWS was Burl Cain, a long-term warden at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, under whom Stalder had previously worked as deputy warden at the Dixon Correctional Institute. Stalder was at first reluctant to take on the statewide position because he preferred to remain warden at David Wade Correctional Institute, the only prison in Louisiana at the time to have been accredited by the American Correctional Association. Stalder's colleagues persuaded him to meet with Edwards, then a candidate for a fourth nonconsecutive term as governor, to discuss the secretary's position. After some delay, Edwards appointed Stalder; the position had been traditionally given to political supporters of the governor. Stalder is a registered Republican voter in East Baton Rouge Parish. In 2003, he was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. Burl Cain was inducted into the Hall of Fame the previous year in 2002. He resides in Zachary with his wife, the former Pamela Davis (also born 1951). The oouple has two sons, Jonathan Eli Stalder (born 1978) and Christopher Davis Stalder (born 1981)."

At Vienna, his instructors included Gustav Tschermak and Albrecht Schrauf. In 1884 he began work as a volunteer in the mineralogical-petrography department of the Naturhistorisches Hofmuseum in Vienna. In 1897 he became a \"custos-adjunct\", later named a curator first-class (1912), and in 1920, was appointed director of the mineralogical-petrography department. His scientific research largely dealt with minerals found in the Tauern region in Austria, e.g. bornite, euclase and sphene as well as the salt minerals glauberite and simonyite from the salt mine at Hallstatt. The mineral koechlinite is named in his honor. He was the author of around 70 scientific papers and made important contributions towards publication of the \"Mineralogisches Taschenbuch\" (first edition, 1911). From 1910 to 1932, he was a staff member of the Wiener Mineralogische Gesellschaft. In 1922, he became a correspondent member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences."

  "text" : "Commander Ralph Frederick Seymour, RN, CMG, DSO, born 6 January 1886, d. 4 October 1922, was a British naval officer. Throughout the First World War he served as Flag Lieutenant to Admiral Sir David Beatty, despite the fact that he did not possess a full training in signalling. During the Battle of Dogger Bank and the Battle of Jutland he was responsible for sending flag signals so ineptly worded that, after the event, they were considered to have diminished the British success in those conflicts. A badly-worded signal he sent during the German battlecruiser raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December 1914 also caused Beatty's scouting forces to break off contact with the enemy, thus prematurely ending the pursuit. Beatty remained loyal and supportive of Seymour during and after the war, and took him to the Admiralty when he became First Sea Lord. After this, however, when Beatty's actions at Jutland began to receive hostile scrutiny, his attitude to Seymour changed and became much more negative. Seymour suffered a nervous breakdown, and was invalided out of the Navy in 1922. He committed suicide by jumping off Black Rock, Brighton, a landmark near his home since redeveloped into Brighton Marina."

The monks had had their privilege of episcopal immunity and right of free election of their abbot confirmed at the council of Bonneuil in 855 and again in 862 at Pîtres. Robert succeeded in having Pope Nicholas I order the case re-opened. King Charles the Bald ruled in the Saint-Calais's favour at a synod in the palace of Verberie on 25 October 863. Charles had granted the abbey to Robert in 862, but he was able to claim that it was only a benefice and thus revocable, and that the bishop did not possess it by right, as he claimed. At Verberie, Charles placed the abbey under royal control and denied its claimed immunity. In 864 Charles sent Robert to Rome with Rothad, the deposed bishop of Soissons, to argue his case before Pope Nicholas. In 873 Robert requested Charles to approve the surrender of some precaria to the monastery of Saint-Vincent du Mans, which was under episcopal control at the time."

When Louis regained his position in 834, Jesse was again deposed and this time exiled to Italy, where he died in 836. Ragenar signed a charter of Archbishop Aldric of Sens giving a privilege to the abbey of Saint-Remy in the diocese of Sens. He was present at the Synod of Thionville in 835, where Archbishop Ebbo of Reims, who with Lothair had restored Jesse to Amiens in 833, was deposed. In 840, after the Emperor Louis's death, he attended the synod at Worms where Ebbo was restored. Ragenar, at the head of a small force raised from the temporalities of his diocese, was part of the army which was on its way south to Toulouse to join King Charles the Bald when it was ambushed by King Pippin II of Aquitaine in the Angoumois on 14 June 844. Ragenar was among the captives while the king's uncle, Hugh, was among the dead. Ragenar remained a prisoner until May 845. That year he managed to attend the synod of Beauvais where Hincmar was chosen to succeed Ebbo. Ragenar attended the regional synod in Quierzy-sur-Oise, held before Easter (14 April) 849, where the doctrine of Gottschalk of Orbais was condemned. He died later that year, possibly in June. No acts of Ragenar's have been preserved in the meagre first millennium archives of Amiens. He was succeeded by Hilmerad. Some 19th-century scholars placed a second Ragenar after Hilmerad, but this was based on confusion."

  "text" : "Richard Davies Ireland (1816 – 11 January 1877) was an Australian politician, a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly and Attorney-General. Ireland was born in Galway, educated at Trinity College, Dublin (B.A., 1837) and was called to the Irish bar in 1838. Ireland emigrated to Victoria in 1852, and was called to the local bar in the following year. His brilliant and gratuitous defence of the Ballarat rioters brought him enormous popularity, and he was elected to represent Castlemaine Boroughs in the Assembly in 1857, and was appointed Solicitor-General in March 1858 in the John O'Shanassy Ministry, retiring with his colleagues in October 1859, when he was returned for Maryborough. Ireland joined the Richard Heales Administration as Attorney-General in November 1860, but resigned in July 1861, four months before the fall of the Ministry. When the O'Shanassy Ministry, which succeeded, came in November, Ireland again became Attorney-General, retiring with his colleagues in June 1863, he did not again hold office. Ireland represented Villiers and Heytesbury from August 1861 until resigning in April 1864, he then represented Kilmore from February 1866 to December 1867. Ireland died in South Yarra, Melbourne on 11 January 1877; his wife Sophia Mary, née Carr predeceased him."

His main concern was the invasion of cattle into the Okavango Delta and the construction of the Northern Buffalo Fence. He was tragically killed in 1994 while on location in Angola filming the Luanda Zoo Rescue Operation when he was attacked by an escaped Bengal tiger. A chapter in the book Carte Blanche, the Stories Behind the Stories by Jessica Pitchford, dealing with 25 years of the history of this South African M-Net television program, has been devoted to the story of his death. His work includes two documentaries on the devastation and desertification of Africa – the 1986 film The End of Eden and the shorter \"The Frightened Wilderness\" of 1984. The ROSCAR award for the environmental conservation campaign is dedicated in the name of Rick Lomba. Lomba`s wife, Brita wishing for his work to go unforgotten, has donated his entire library of work to the African Environmental Film Foundation."

Eichhorst (born October 21, 1933) is a retired professional basketball player who played one game with the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the St. Louis Hawks during the 1961–62 season. Eichorst scored two points, had three assists, and grabbed one rebound in ten minutes of action. He attended Southeast Missouri State College, now known as Southeast Missouri State University. As a senior during the 1955-56 season, Eichorst set a school single-game scoring record of 36 points. Eichhorst was an official in the American Football League, moving to the National Football League in 1970, the first season following the NFL-AFL merger. He resigned from the NFL at the conclusion of the 1970 campaign to concentrate on his career as a college basketball official. Eichhorst was the line judge on the crew of referee Bernie Ulman and wore uniform number 77 during his lone NFL season. His number and position were filled by Don Orr for 1971, although a shuffling of crew assignments moved Tommy Hensley to Ulman's crew as line judge in 1971."

  "text" : "Reginald Mount (1906–1979) was a British graphic designer. Mount was born Edward Reginald Mount, on 4 July 1906. He worked as a designer for various advertising agencies in London in the 1930s, then joined the Ministry of Information at the outbreak of the Second World War. Throughout the war, Mount worked extensively with the designer Eileen Evans. Together, they produced many posters for the Ministry's public awareness and propaganda campaigns, including their renowned anti-venereal disease campaign of 1943–1944. Other designer colleagues in the Ministry of Information's \"general division\" included Maurice V. Bennett and Kenneth Bird, better known as the cartoonist 'Fougasse'. Their work was overseen by the Ministry's studio manager, Edwin Embleton. Some time after 1941, he worked on a series of posters probably intended for export to the Soviet Union (they were accompanied by Russian text). The example pictured shows a hand, representing the merchant navy carrying a Hawker Hurricane to the USSR, to reinforce the Soviet air force. Several of his wartime works depict an anthropomorphised, cartoon-style incendiary bomb, 'Fire-bomb Fritz'. Mount was subsequently a founding member of the Artist Partners agency, which was established in 1950 by the agent Donovan Candler in Lower John Street, Soho, London. Mount continued to work in partnership with Eileen Evans. In the 1950s and 1960s, their 'Mount/Evans studio' became closely associated with the post-war Central Office of Information, producing designs for a wide variety of government agencies. Mount also designed the cinema poster for the British comedy film The Ladykillers. His work is in collections including those of The National Archives, The Science Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Mount died on 31 January 1979."

  "text" : "Robert E Fuller (born 1972) is a British artist best known for his renditions of British fauna, rendered faithfully in oils, acrylic and bronze. The RSPCA and the National Trust are among his British customers. He also travels the world to study birds and animals in their natural habitat and his paintings sell internationally. His lifelike paintings and sculpture are the result of months spent immersed in the natural habitat of his wild subjects. A passionate conservationist, Fuller combines his art with work to preserve the animals and birds to which he owes his livelihood. He uses his paintings to raise funds for conservation and is a founding member of the barn owl conservation group Wolds Barn Owl Group near his home in North Yorkshire. The artist also writes a monthly column in The Yorkshire Post and the Ryedale Gazette and Herald in which he shares his enthusiasm for all things wild. His regular appearances on British television championing wild creatures near his home and gallery on the Yorkshire Wolds have earned him a reputation as an ambassador for the region's wildlife. As such he appeared on ITV's Calendar, Countryfile on April 12, 2011, BBC Look North and BBC The One Show on 16 January 2013. In 2011 Fuller was given an award for bravery by the RSPCA after his quick action when he stumbled upon an armed gang of badger baiters and helped secure a successful conviction. Born in 1972, Fuller moved to Great Givendale, where his father, Richard Fuller, an author and wildlife enthusiast, earned notability for wildlife conservation after winning the Silver Lapwing award for farm conservation. In 2014, Fuller visited the Galápagos Islands and subsequently painted a series of Galapagos wildlife pieces. These were the focus of the summer exhibition at his gallery and then went on display at The Deep (aquarium) in Hull. He also did a series of school visits in Yorkshire with staff from the Galapagos Conservation Trust. In 2015, Fuller was visited and interviewed by Julian Clary in an episode of Nature Nuts with Julian Clary, a nature show on ITV."

  "text" : "Robert C. Doerr (c. 1914 – December 5, 2013) was an American politician and educator. He served as the 53rd Mayor of San Jose, California, from 1956 to 1958. Doerr was the city's oldest living mayor at the time of his death in December 2013. Doerr's grandfather, Charles, served on the San Jose City Council. His father, Fred Doerr, who was also a member of the city council, also served as the Mayor of San Jose from 1928 until 1930. Robert Doerr lived with his family at a home at Fifth and William Streets during the 1930s. He earned a bachelor's degree from San Jose State University. In 1950, Doerr and Alden Campen, a city landowner and World War II veteran, ran together as candidates for the San Jose City Council. The two men promised that the city would acquire the San Jose Water Company if elected. The San Jose Water Company countered Campen's and Doerr's campaigns by running a series of negative ads which portrayed them as socialists. Campen lost the election, but Doerr was elected to the council. Doerr served on the city council during the 1950s. During the early part of the decade, Doerr proposed a new tax on the city's parochial schools. The tax proposal, which was opposed by the city's Catholic community, was defeated following an effort led by John P. McEnery, the father of a future San Jose mayor, Tom McEnery. Doerr supported the policies of city manager, A. P. Hamann, who spearheaded much of the city's urban expansion during the 1950s and 1960s. Hamann also had San Jose City Hall moved to a new location in Downtown San Jose in 1958. Doerr served one term as Mayor of San Jose from 1956 to 1958. At that time, the Mayor was chosen from members of the city council, rather than through a direct election. As mayor (and a WWII veteran), Doerr pushed for closer ties between the city and Japan. He established a sister city relationship between San Jose and Okayama. He traveled to Okayama to mark the occasion, where he delivered a speech in Japanese from memory. The city of San Jose also celebrated its centennial in 1957 during his tenure as mayor. At the time of his term of Mayor, a part-time job in a city of little more than 100,00, Doerr taught Civics at Willow Glen High School. He advised all of his students to buy real estate, that San Jose was going to be a big city. Speaking as a former student of that time, I wish I had heeded that bit of wisdom. Doerr resided at the Atrium senior home in South San Jose during his later life. He died on December 5, 2013, at the age of 99."

  "text" : "Richard Yates (born 26 January 1986) is an English 400 metres hurdles athlete best known for his 5th-place finish in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi India and bronze medal in the 4x400 metre relay at the same Championships. His personal best for the 400m hurdles is 49.06 seconds. Richard started running in his early childhood at the age of four and continued to pursue athletics alongside his education, first competing at an international level by the time he was 22. Despite becoming the British Champion at 400m hurdles in 2008 he was not selected to represent England in the Beijing Olympics, to some controversy. He later reclaimed his title as English Champion again in 2013. Outside of his achievements on the athletics track, Richard also has an equally impressive academic record. Following the completion of his A level’s at Manchester Grammar School where Richard achieved straight A’s, he went on to study Law at The University of Leeds, achieving upper second class honours (2:1).

Nichol was the original choice to play Captain Antilles, before George Lucas considered using Denis Lawson, the actor that portrayed Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy. However, Lawson turned down the offer and Nichol was once again the choice. Nichol appeared in the 2011 film Red Dog alongside Revenge of the Sith co-star Keisha Castle-Hughes (Queen Apailana).

He was brought up in a prosperous family of Quakers, but converted to Protestantism. Although he was an excellent student at Cambridge University, he did not earn any degree. He devoted his life and wealth to Christian evangelism. He committed himself to a life of tramp and a recluse, minimising his entire expenditure on his own welfare. This was due to his strong premillennialism that when the Gospel of Jesus is spread to the entire world, then the Second Coming of Christ would happen. He was the benefactor to the success of Baptist Missionary Society and London Missionary Society, thereby becoming the principal factor in the spread of Protestantism, modernisation and formal education in the remotest parts of the world."

Brown was born in Hiawatha, Kansas, on July 26, 1891. She attended high school in California and then moved to Oklahoma where she graduated from Northwestern State Normal School in 1910. In 1915 she graduated from the University of Oklahoma. In November 1919 she was hired as the librarian in the Bartlesville Public Library, a Carnegie library which opened in 1913. She held this post until she was relieved of her duties in 1950 on the baseless accusation that she was a communist when, in fact, she was fired because of her desegregation activities. Brown helped established the Committee on the Practice of Democracy in Bartlesville in 1946. This was the first CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) group south of the Mason–Dixon line. Miss Brown is nationally recognized as the first librarian to receive assistance from the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the American Library Association."

  "text" : "Ruth A. Myers (1926–2001) was known as the “grandmother of American Indian Education in Minnesota.” A persistent voice for American Indian children and their families, Myers focused on education policy. She focused on learning opportunities for American Indian children. She also worked for curriculum and resource materials that reflected the American Indian history and culture for all Minnesota learners. Myers was a member of the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. She was not a professional educator. Her interest in education came first as a concerned mother of four children. As a child she was sent to an Indian boarding school. This fact shaped her life. She spoke little of her experiences there but harnessed the pain to inspire positive change. Always an active member of her tribal community, Myers was urged to run for the Duluth School Board in 1971. She was elected, becoming the first non-White elected to public office in Duluth. Four years later, Myers wanted to take her advocacy to a statewide level. She asked Governor Rudy Perpich to be appointed to the Minnesota State Board of Education (SBE). Myers was its first American Indian member. From that position she was appointed to numerous other posts, including a term on the Education Commission of the States. Myers had great impact on the direction of the SBE. She twice served as its chair. She encouraged review of how American Indians were presented in textbooks, library materials, and the core curriculum. She fought for preservation of American Indian languages in the schools. Myers also insisted that every Minnesota student know something about Indian culture. Myers looked at proposed rules from the perspective of their effect on American Indian families. For example, she charged that educators ignored specific nutritional needs and dietary restrictions, such as sensitivity to dairy products among native youth. She also reminded policy-makers of the American Indian origins of the University of Minnesota Morris (UM-Morris) campus. With this history in mind, she advocated for native students to be able to attend UM-Morris without paying tuition. In the early 1990s Myers joined the staff of the University of Minnesota Duluth (UM-D) Medical School. She had been at UM-D since 1973, as part of the Education Department. While there she started sixteen of seventeen UM-D programs for American Indian students. As Co-Director of the Center of American Indian and Minority Health at the UM-D School of Medicine, she recruited students and gave them academic coaching. She also helped them with life’s details. For example, she regularly bought food for the UM-D medical students who might not have time to shop or be able to afford it. When Myers retired from UM-D in1994, the university honored her by establishing the Ruth A. Myers Endowed Chair of American Indian Studies. Her interest in education showed in other ways as well. In 1986 Myers chaired the Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College (FLTCC) task force. The task force helped establish the permanent campus of Fond du Lac Community College in Cloquet. The FLTCC library is named the Ruth A. Myers Library in her honor. The Library contains a wealth of American Indian materials including the Anishinaabe and Minnesota regional collections. It also holds a juvenile/young adult collection of American Indian materials. During her lifetime Myers represented the interests of American Indians in many ways. She was on as many as seventy boards and commissions. She was named the Elder of the Year by the Minnesota Indian Education Association. Other awards included the Marvelous Minnesota Woman Award, the Marge Wilkins Award, the UM-D Chancellor’s Distinguished Civil Service Award, and University of Minnesota President Hasselmo’s Diversity Award. Ruth A. Myers died in 2001 at the age of 75."

  "text" : "Sir Robin Hooper KCMG DSO DFC served in the Royal Air Force during World War II and later became the British Ambassador to Greece. On the night of 16/17 November 1943, Flight Lieutenant Hooper, took off in Westland Lysander ‘MA-D’ from RAF Tangmere, with Special Operations Executive (SOE) agents in the rear cockpit, for a field in France. The outward flight was uneventful, but upon landing in a field he soon realised that all was not well; the ground was extremely soft requiring a great deal of throttle to keep the aircraft moving. In making the turn to return to meet the reception committee, the Lysander became stuck. The aircraft was immovable and even with maximum throttle the aircraft became bogged down in the mud. After attempts to manually push the Lysander out failed, it was decided to get some bullocks from the nearest farm. Two duly arrived with the farmer and his family, only too keen to help – trenches were dug in front of the wheels to form a ramp and all was ready! The bullocks were hitched to the aircraft and started to pull but nothing happened. Two more bullocks were fetched but again the Lysander failed to move. All this took about two hours and Robin finally realised that there was no hope of digging the aircraft out and set about setting it on fire. “D” for “Dog” burnt well in the misty field and soon the agents and Robin were on their way back to a resistance safe house. Robin was safely hidden from the Germans until picked up by fellow pick-up pilot Lewis (Bob) Hodges a month later on the night of 16/17 December. He was British ambassador to the Greek government from 1971 to 1974."

  "text" : "Robert fitzRoger was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk. FitzRoger was the son of Roger fitzRichard, who held Warkworth and was lord of Clavering, Essex. FitzRoger was sheriff of Norfolk from Michaelmas in 1190 to Easter 1194 and then again from Michaelmas 1197 to Easter 1200. FitzRoger's first appointment as sheriff was due to the influence of William de Longchamp, who was Lord Chancellor. Longchamp's influence also secured custody of Orford Castle for fitzRoger. Longchamp also arranged for fitzRoger to have custody of Eye Castle in Suffolk. When Longchamp fell from royal favour and was replaced by Walter of Coutances, fitzRoger was one of the few of Longchamp's appointments to retain his office of sheriff. FitzRoger had confirmation of his ownership of Warkworth in 1199 and in 1205 was granted Newburn and the barony of Whalton in Northumberland. Warkworth and Newburn occasionally were considered baronies, but not consistently. FitzRoger also held Clavering from Henry of Essex for one knight's fee. FitzRoger's holdings were extensive enough that he was considered a baron during the reigns of King Richard I and King John of England. FitzRoger married Margaret, one of the daughters and heiresses of William de Chesney, the founder of Sibton Abbey. Margaret was one of three daughters, but she inherited the bulk of her father's estates. Margaret was the widow of Hugh de Cressy. Through Margaret, Roger gained the barony of Blythburgh in Suffolk. He also acquired lands at Rottingdean in Sussex from Margaret. FitzRoger died in 1214, and his heir was his son John fitzRobert, by his wife Margaret. Margaret survived fitzRoger and paid a fine of a thousand pounds to the king for the right to administer her lands and dower properties herself."

  "text" : "Robert Spangler (January 10, 1933 – August 5, 2001) was a serial killer who came into the spotlight following the murders of his first wife, son, daughter, and his third wife. On the morning of December 30, 1978, in Littleton, Colorado, Robert Spangler lured his wife, Nancy, into the basement with the promise of a \"surprise.\" He then shot her in the head with a .38 handgun. Going upstairs, he shot his teenage children, Susan and David. David was slow in dying, so Spangler finished him off by smothering him with a pillow. Spangler had cunningly framed the crime scene, making it appear that his wife had shot their children and then herself. In April 1993, when Spangler's third marriage to 59-year-old aerobics instructor Donna Sundling went sour, he took her hiking in the Grand Canyon and pushed her off a 140-foot (40 m) drop to her death."

  "text" : "Ralph G. Martin (March 4, 1920 — January 9, 2013) was an American journalist who authored or co-authored about thirty books, including popular biographies of recent historical figures, among which, Jennie, a two-volume (1969 and 1971) study of Winston Churchill's American mother, Lady Randolph Churchill, became the most prominent bestseller. Other successful tomes focused on British royal romance (Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson in 1974, as well as Prince Charles and Lady Diana in 1985) and on the Kennedy family (John F. Kennedy in 1983 and Joseph P. Kennedy in 1995). Born in Chicago, Ralph Martin Goldberg was eight years old when his family moved to Brooklyn, and started using the name Ralph G. Martin at an early age. He studied at City College of New York and, subsequently, University of Missouri from which he graduated in 1941 with a bachelor's degree in journalism. Twenty-one years old upon receiving his diploma, he decided to hitchhike and found a newspaper job at Box Elder News Journal which served Brigham City, the county seat of Utah's Box Elder County. In December, following declaration of war in the aftermath of attack on Pearl Harbor, Martin enlisted in the Army and spent the war as a combat correspondent for the Armed Forces newspaper Stars and Stripes and the Army weekly magazine, Yank. In 1944, having interviewed New York City's mayor, Fiorello La Guardia, for Yank, Martin asked La Guardia to perform his marriage ceremony to Marjorie Pastel. Returning to civilian life in 1945, Martin began working as editor for news and analysis publications Newsweek and The New Republic and became executive editor at decorating and domestic arts magazine House Beautiful. During the months preceding the 1952 and 1956 presidential elections, he served as a member of the campaign staff for the Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson. Having lived for years in the Connecticut town of Westport, near New York City, Ralph G. Martin moved to the Kendal on Hudson retirement community in another of the city's suburbs, Sleepy Hollow, where he died seven-and-a-half weeks before his 93rd birthday. He and his wife Marjorie were the parents of two daughters and a son. Upon publication of Seeds of Destruction: Joe Kennedy and His Sons, he was invited for an hour-long conversation with Charlie Rose, broadcast December 8, 1995 on Rose's long-running TV interview program. A clip from the conversation was included on Rose's year-end show in memoriam of 35 guests on his programs, between 1991 and 2009, who died in 2013."

During the Becket controversy (lasting until Becket's death in 1170) between King Henry and Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, de Broc supported the king and was granted the administration of the exiled archbishop's lands during the later half of the 1160s. This earned de Broc three sentences of excommunication from the archbishop because of de Broc's financial exactions from the estates. De Broc was with the four men who murdered Becket in December 1170, although he did not take part in the actual murder. At de Broc's death around 1179, he left behind a widow and five daughters, who were his co-heiresses."

After the war, he began to translate professionally for Kegan Paul and others, specializing in works on philosophy. Hull was described as quick-minded, a stutterer and a \"tall, elegant, distinguished-looking man sporting a malacca cane with a silver top.\" Most of the English-speaking world know of Carl Jung's work through translations by R.F.C. Hull. He translated or recycled about four million words of Jung's writings, and his obituary said that \"Virtually every word that Jung wrote or that was recorded as his statement passed through the circuit of Hull's mind.\""

His land in Norwalk was immediately south of the present day site of the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery, and the bridge leading south from that area was formerly called Beacham's Bridge. Due to his location being in between the main area of the settlement and the area then called The Neck where cattle grazed, he served as a \"gate-keeper.\" He left Norwalk in 1657 or 1658,  and settled near Green's Farms in present-day Westport. He was made a freeman of Fairfield in 1664. He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founders of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery."

  "text" : "Richard Atkinson Price (1864 – 22 June 1936) was an Irish-born Australian politician. He was born in Dublin and arrived in New South Wales around 1879. He and his brother established a wool importation and tailoring firm and became prominent businessman. From 1887 to 1893 he was a Rockdale alderman. In 1894 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as a Protectionist member for Gloucester. In 1901, when the Protectionists became the Progressive Party, Price instead became an independent, winning re-election as such that year. He was defeated in an attempt to transfer to Durham in 1904 but returned in 1907, once more as the member for Gloucester. He eventually joined the Liberal Party before the 1910 election and received endorsement from the Farmers and Settlers Association in 1913, but he was an independent again by 1917. On 18 October 1917 he was expelled from the Assembly after a Royal Commission found that allegations he had made against Lands Minister William Ashford were found wanton and reckless. Despite this he was re-elected at the subsequent by-election. In 1920, with the introduction of proportional representation, he was elected as a member for Oxley, representing the Progressive Party, forerunner of the Country Party. He was one of the \"True Blues\" in the Progressive split of 1921 and lost his seat in 1922."

With Hitler's rise to power, the family moved to Prague, Vienna and Milan. In 1937, in Vienna, he was received into the Catholic church and took up journalism. In 1939 at the outbreak of the Second World War he was in London, working for Austrian and German newspapers, and in 1940 he was briefly interned on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien. He later joined a Scottish Infantry regiment in the British Army, changing his name in case he was captured. In London, where he died, he worked for The Tablet and as correspondent for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Die Presse and others."

  "text" : "Rusty Ryan was the stage name of Robert Brian Timbrell (December 28, 1947 - July 28, 2003), a Canadian actor and drag queen. He was a founding member of The Great Impostors, a long-running drag troupe in Toronto, Ontario whose members included Ryan, Tammy Autumn, Michelle DuBarry, Danny Love, Jackie Loren, Terri Stevens, Christian Jefferies and Dale Barnett at different times. Timbrell was born in Kingston, Ontario on December 28, 1947, the younger brother of politician Dennis Timbrell. He was working as a stockbroker when he first began performing in the 1970s, and was given his drag name by friend and fellow performer Craig Russell. With the Great Impostors, Ryan toured extensively across Canada, giving many smaller communities their first exposure to drag and LGBT culture; in the 1980s, he accompanied Frankie Goes to Hollywood on their North American tour. In 1992, he wrote and performed a one-man play, Driving to Tatamagouche, at the Toronto Fringe Festival. He also had numerous minor roles in television and film. Best known to film audiences for his supporting role as Jimmy the bartender in Outrageous! and its sequel Too Outrageous, he also appeared in the television films The Sins of Dorian Gray and The Wharf Rat, the theatrical film 54, an episode of Queer as Folk and a music video by Platinum Blonde. He died of a heart attack on July 28, 2003 in Liverpool, Nova Scotia, following a performance that was part of his first tour performing comedy out of drag. Following his death, writer Jeffrey Round prepared and released a documentary film, Driving with Rusty."

  "text" : "Russell Spanner (1916–1974) was a Canadian designer who contributed to residential furniture designs in the 1950s. Spanner's designs included dining and lounge chairs, tables, and modular storage units. The designs were manufactured at Spanner Products Limited, the family-owned woodworking company in Toronto, Canada, founded originally by his grandfather. His furniture lines were sold and distributed at department store chains and independent merchants. \"The Ruspan Originals line was boxy and geometric, but most of all it was simple, functional and modern, all qualities that appealed to young post-war couples buying furniture for their new houses or apartments.\"Spanner's designs utilized innovative manufacturing techniques such as curved plywood and non-upholstered, woven-web seating. Many of the designs reused components and shared consistent proportions, which gave his work a characteristic aesthetic. Among his three residential furniture lines (Ruspan Originals, Catalina, and Pasadena) the Lounge Chair with Arms has been described as the \"best-known and most desirable\" design. Spanner was an amateur wrestling champion, and was known to test the strength of his designs by jumping on them and throwing them across the factory floor."

Among his notable films are the monks-versus-gangsters comedy Hi! Dharma! (2001), \"kimchi\" western The Good, the Bad, the Weird (2008), and Korean War movie The Front Line (2011). He also appeared on TV in the quirky series Evasive Inquiry Agency (also known as Four Gold Chasers, 2007), revenge drama The Chaser (2012), and power-struggle saga Empire of Gold (2013). Despite being one of his earliest projects, the 2002 melodrama Winter Sonata is among Ryu's better known roles outside Korea, given the series' popularity throughout Asia. In 2009, he reprised his character via voice acting in the animated adaptation Winter Sonata Anime. Ryu wrote his memoir Don't Be an Actor Like Me, which was published in 2009."

He took over Best & Lloyd, his father's light industrial engineering works in Birmingham, having previously trained as a metal designer at art school in Düsseldorf. He went on to design the Bestlite, an iconic Bauhaus-styled desk lamp that remains in production and was used by Winston Churchill in Whitehall. Best was an early apostle of the posture therapist F.M. Alexander of the Alexander technique, campaigned for better art-school education for industrial apprentices, and was a founder of the Common Wealth Party in 1942. His social circle included a group of Birmingham artists and intellectuals including Prof. Philip Sargant Florence and others associated with Birmingham University. He also befriended Nikolaus Pevsner during Pevsner's 15 months in Birmingham between 1934-5, and hosted the first visit of Walter Gropius to the Midlands after Gropius's departure from Germany in 1935. Best wrote prolifically, though only one of his books was published in his lifetime: Brass Chandelier, his history of his father's experiments with metal manufacturing and promotion of progressive German pedagogic ideas, which Pevsner reviewed in the Architectural Review. Best's history of his own early life and that of his younger brother Frank, both of whom served in the First World War, was published posthumously as Frank's Great War."

  "text" : "Ryan W. Ferguson (born October 19, 1984) is an American personal trainer and author who spent nearly 10 years in prison after being convicted of a 2001 murder in his hometown of Columbia, Missouri. At the time of the murder, Ferguson was a 17-year-old high school student. Kent Heitholt was found beaten and strangled shortly after 2 am on November 1, 2001, in the parking lot of the Columbia Daily Tribune, where he worked as a sports editor. Heitholt's murder went unsolved for two years until police received a tip that a man named Charles Erickson could not remember the evening of the murder and was concerned that he may have been involved with the murder. Erickson, who spent that evening partying with Ferguson, was interrogated by police. Despite initially seeming to have no memory of the evening of the murders, he eventually confessed and implicated Ferguson as well. Ferguson was convicted in the fall of 2005 on the basis of Erickson's testimony as well as the testimony of a building employee. Both witnesses later recanted their testimony, claiming they were coerced to lie by the police. The 2005 conviction was eventually vacated on November 5, 2013, by the Western District of the Missouri Court of Appeals, and Ferguson was released on the evening of November 12, after he spent almost a decade in prison. The case has been featured on 48 Hours, Dateline, and numerous other newspapers and media outlets."

He was one of the sons of Mukhtiyar Kaji Damodar Pande. He served as the Prime Minister for two terms, serving 1837 – 1837 (First Term) and 1839 – 1840 AD (Second Term). He became powerful after Bhimsen Thapa was arrested, and was declared Mukhtiyar and Commander in Chief. He was a grandson of Kaji Kalu Pandey who was the commander of King Prithvi Narayan Shah and the Mulkaji of Gorkha and a notable figure during the unification campaign of Nepal. The death of Queen Tripurasundari in 1832, who was a distant cousin of Rana Jang and the strongest supporter and niece of Bhimsen Thapa, and the adulthood of King Rajendra, weakened Bhimsen Thapa's hold on power. The conspiracies and infighting with rival courtiers (especially the Pandes, who held Bhimsen Thapa responsible for the death of Damodar Pande in 1804) finally led to imprisonment of Bhimsen Thapa and death by suicide in 1839. However, the court infighting did not subside with his death, and the political instability eventually paved way for the establishment of the Rana dynasty."

  "text" : "Robert Stephen Strichartz (born October 14, 1943, in New York City) is an American mathematician, specializing in mathematical analysis. In 1966 Strichartz received his PhD from Princeton University under Elias Stein with thesis Multipliers on generalized Sobolev spaces. In 1967 he was C.L.E. Moore Instructor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is a professor at Cornell University. Strichartz works on harmonic analysis (including wavelets and analysis on Lie groups), partial differential equations, and analysis on fractals. Strichartz estimates are named after him due to his application of such estimates to harmonic analysis on homogeneous and nonhomogeneous linear dispersive and wave equations; his work was subsequently generalized to nonlinear wave equations by Terence Tao and others. Strichartz is also known for his analysis on fractals, building upon the work of Jun Kigami on the construction of a Laplacian operator on fractals such as the Sierpinski–Menger sponge. In 1983 he won the Lester Randolph Ford Award for Radon inversion – variations on a theme."

  "text" : "Rudolf Sturany (13 April 1867, Vienna – 28 February 1935, Vienna) was an Austrian zoologist who specialized in the field of malacology, the study of mollusks. He studied zoology at the University of Leipzig under Rudolf Leuckart and at the University of Vienna, where his instructors included Carl Claus, Friedrich Moritz Brauer and Karl Grobben. In 1891 he obtained his PhD at Vienna. In September 1889 he began work as a volunteer at the Natural History Museum of Vienna, later serving as a curator, being entrusted with the collections of mollusks, bryozoans, brachiopods and tunicates. During his career, he took frequent trips for scientific research in Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dalmatia, Montenegro, Albania and Crete. In 1924 he retired from museum work due to a deteriorating eye condition. Sturany was the taxonomic authority for numerous mollusk species, a few examples being: Spelaeoconcha paganettii, Pseudobithynia pentheri and Mitra gonatophora. The land snail genus Sturanyella, in all likelihood, is named after him."

  "text" : "Robert Eaglestone (born 1968) is a British academic and writer. He is Professor of Contemporary Literature and Thought in the Department of English at Royal Holloway, University of London. He works on contemporary literature, literary theory and contemporary European philosophy, and on Holocaust and Genocide studies. In 2014, Eaglestone was the recipient of a National Teaching Fellowship, among the highest awards for pedagogy at university level in the United Kingdom. His work explores how literature ‘thinks’, especially in relation to issues of ethics. This was the subject of his first book, Ethical Criticism: Reading After Levinas, on literary theory and the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas. This focus on ethics broadened to a concern with ethical relationships to the past, centrally the Holocaust, other genocides and atrocities, in The Holocaust and the Postmodern. His work draws on memory studies and trauma studies, as well as on the thought of Jacques Derrida and Hannah Arendt. He works widely on contemporary literature, including Salman Rushdie and J. M. Coetzee and is the author of Contemporary Literature: A Very Short Introduction. In that book he writes: Literature thinks. Literature is where ideas are investigated, lived out, explored in all their messy complexity… Perhaps… ‘think’ is not the right word: ‘think’ is too limiting a description of the range of what a novel can do with ideas. In any event, the way literature thinks is bound up with what it’s like to be us, to be human. Literature is how we make ourselves intelligible to ourselves. And contemporary fiction matters because it is how we work out who we are now, today. He is also concerned with the teaching of literature. He has written the textbook, Doing English, a Guide for Literature Students; edits a series of books introducing major thinkers, Routledge Critical Thinkers, and is a commentator in the national press on literature teaching  at school and in Higher Education. He lives in Brixton, London, and has two children."

From the early 1960s he was employed as an arranger and producer at Columbia Records, where he was responsible for records by singers such as Andy Williams, Barbra Streisand, Bobby Vinton, Dion, Johnny Mathis, Julie Andrews, Mel Tormé, Patti Page and Ray Peterson. In 1960, he conducted the orchestra in the song  Good Timin', sung by  Jimmy Jones. The song also later became a hit for Kyu Sakamoto. He was also responsible for many of Aretha Franklin's early recordings at Columbia, including her 1964 tribute album to Dinah Washington, Unforgettable. According to writer Ursula Rivera, Mersey \"was able to provide musical arrangements that highlighted Aretha's unique voice whether she was singing a noisy blues number or a heartbreaking ballad.\" Mersey also arranged and composed for CBS Television and films, and produced several albums of incidental music, including Great Jazz from Great TV, credited to \"Det Moor\". He died in Baltimore, Maryland, at the age of 77."

  "text" : "Rebecca Makkai (born April 20, 1978) is an American novelist and short-story writer. Her first novel, The Borrower, was released in June 2011. It was a Booklist Top Ten Debut, an Indie Next pick, an O Magazine selection, and one of Chicago Magazine's choices for best fiction of 2011. It was translated into seven languages. Her short stories have been anthologized in The Best American Short Stories 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and have also appeared in Ploughshares, Tin House, The Threepenny Review, New England Review, and Shenandoah. Her nonfiction has appeared in Harpers and on Salon.com. Makkai's stories have also been featured on Public Radio International's Selected Shorts and This American Life. Her second novel, The Hundred-Year House, is set in the Northern suburbs of Chicago, and was published by Viking/Penguin in July 2014, having received starred reviews in Booklist, Publishers Weekly and Library Journal. It won the 2015 Novel of the Year award from the Chicago Writers Association and was named a best book of 2014 by BookPage. Her short story collection, Music for Wartime, was published by Viking in June 2015. A starred and featured review in Publishers Weekly said, \"Though these stories alternate in time between WWII and the present day, they all are set, as described in the story “Exposition,” within “the borders of the human heart”—a terrain that their author maps uncommonly well.” Makkai, who grew up in Lake Bluff, Illinois, is the daughter of linguistics professors Valerie Becker Makkai and Adam Makkai. Her paternal grandmother, Ignacz Rozsa, was a well-known actress and novelist in Hungary. Makkai graduated from Lake Forest Academy, thereafter from Washington and Lee University with a BA in English, and subsequently earned a master's degree from Middlebury College's Bread Loaf School of English. She has taught at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, Northwestern University, Lake Forest College, Sierra Nevada College, and StoryStudio Chicago."

He is now a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. His research concerns the topology of 4-manifolds. In 1990, he demonstrated with Tomasz Mrowka that there is a simply connected irreducible 4-manifold that admits no complex structures. In 1995 he constructed new examples of simply connected compact symplectic 4-manifolds that are not homeomorphic or diffeomorphic to complex manifolds (Kähler manifolds). He is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994 in Zurich (Smooth four-manifolds and symplectic topology)."

  "text" : "Rosalinda Cauich Ramirez (b. February 24, 1962) is a Mexican artisan specializing in basket weaving. Her work has been recognized with various awards. Cauich Ramirez was born in Kopchén, a small community 22km southwest of  Felipe Carrillo Puerto in the southeastern state of Quintana Roo. She received her first basket as a gift when she was seven, but began making them when she was ten. At that time, the municipality brought an instructor to the community to teach fiber arts, and she began making fruit bowls and round baskets with carrying handles. Her father encouraged her interest by colleting materials for her and helping with their preparation. Today, she has a repertoire of over forty basic designs, which include baskets of various shapes and sizes, animal figures, fruit bowls, carrying bags, cradles, lamp bases, flower vases and more. She principally works with a plant called guaco, a fibrous, resistant climbing vine found in the higher altitudes in the Yucatan Peninsula, originally used by her community to create thatched roofs. There are eleven different species of guaco in Quintana Roo, with the most common called tendón de sapo in Spanish or chiicheních much in Maya. If the vine is tough, she boils it first to take the bark off and divide it into strips. She uses her hands to weave the vines but sometimes uses her feet for stability. She has passed on her ability to her eight children, her nieces and nephews and her husband, Jacinto Mex Puc. Her family depends on this activity economically, and her children participate in workshop activities among other activities. The activity has allowed her to travel and meet other artisans in various parts of Mexico, as well as win various recognitions. She has won first place for pieces made for various crafts competitions, such as first place in the semi rigid fibers category at the 2011 Concurso Nacional de Fibras Vegetales organized by FONART.In 1996, she was named a Grand Masters by the Fomento Cultural Banamex, and in 2011 was named a “distinguished woman of Quintana Roo” by Governor Félix González Canto."

  "text" : "Roland Leong (born 1945) is an American drag racer, whose \"Hawaiian\" Top Fuel Drafters swept the National Hot Rod Association's two National Events, the Winternationals at the Pomona Fairgrounds and the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis, two years consecutively, in 1965 and again in 1966. This feat by Leong's entries was accomplished with two different drivers, as Don \"the Snake\" Prudhomme scored the back-to-back victories in 1965, followed by Mike Snively in 1966. In 1967, Leong failed to three-peat at Pomona or Indianapolis, but did triumph that year at two popular independent drag races, the notoriously fierce March Meet in Bakersfield, and the Hot Rod Magazine Championships in Riverside, CA. In 1969, abandoned campaigning Top Fuel Dragster in favor of the burgeoning Funny Car class. The following year, with driver Larry Reyes, Leong campaigned a 1970 Dodge Charger AA/Funny Car that won its class at the 1970 NHRA Winternationals. In 1971, Leong's \"Hawaiian\" Funny Car repeated at Pomona, winning Funny Car Eliminator again, this time with Butch Maas driving. Throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, Leong campaigned a variety of \"Hawaiian\" Funny Cars, both in NHRA competition, as well as \"match racing\" at smaller, independent tracks. In 1980, having hired Ron Colson to drive in what was that man's final year as a professional race-car driver, Leong tuned his \"King's Hawaiian Bread\" Corvette Funny Car to victory at the NHRA Winston World Finals in Ontario, California. Besides being Colson's last race, the event was also notable as being the last drag race at Ontario Motor Speedway. In 1983, with MIke Dunn at the helm, Leong's \"Hawaiian Punch\" Funny Car won the Bakersfield March Meet. The car crashed and was destroyed later that year at the NHRA World Finals at Orange County International Raceway. After Leong and Dunn parted ways in 1984, Leong and his new driver, Rick Johnson, won the 1985 Bakersfield March Meet, followed later that year by a victory at NHRA's Le Grandnational-Molson in Quebec, Canada. In 1991, Leong once again won the US Nationals at Indianapolis, this time in Funny Car Eliminator, and with Jim White driving. Later, at the Chief Nationals in Dallas, Texas, his \"Hawaiian Punch\" Funny Car was the first in the class to break the 290-mph speed mark. Following the 1991 season, Roland relinquished his role as car owner. In 1996, he began serving as a crew chief for the Red Line Oil Dodge Avenger Funny Car of Ray Higley. Despite the entry's limited finances, with Leong's input and expertise, Higley posted his career-best 1/4-mile elapsed time, posting a 5.00-second clocking at the 1996 US Nationals. In 1998, Don Prudhomme, then retired from driving and now a multi-car team owner, hired Leong to tune his \"Skoal\" Funny Car. With Ron Capps driving, Prudhomme's Leong-tuned entry won Funny Car Eliminator at that year's Winternationals. Despite winning more NHRA National Events than anybody else in the class, the Prudhomme-Leong-Capps collaboration finished second in NHRA points, behind winner John Force. In 2009, after having taken a hiatus from the sport, Leong returned to drag racing, now acting as crew chief for \"vintage\" Nitro Funny Cars racing primarily in NHRA's new Hot Rod Heritage Series.In 2014, Canadian drag racer Ron Hodgson hired Leong to tune the Troy Lee Designs Nitro Funny Car driven by Tim Boychuk, for competition in the NHRA Heritage Series."

  "text" : "Robert Blennerhassett (c.1622 - c.1689) was an Anglo-Irish soldier and politician. Blennerhassett was the son of Captain John Blennerhassett and Martha Lynn. He was probably born at the family estate at Ballycarty Castle, County Kerry. The Blennerhassett family, originally from East Anglia, had been granted large estates in Ireland by the Crown as part of the Plantations. He was the brother of John Blennerhassett MP. Blennerhassett served as an officer in the Cromwellian army during the Irish Confederate Wars, ensuring that his lands remained intact. He was granted a full pardon following the Restoration of the Monarchy. He served as the Member of Parliament for Tralee in 1674, as had his grandfather. Blennerhassett then served as High Sheriff of Kerry in 1682."

  "text" : "Robert Lebron (March 13, 1928 - August 31, 2013) was an American impressionist artist. He was born in New York City, where he attended New York City's High School of Music and Arts. He also went on to study at the Art's Students' League for five years. Lebron developed his own personal technique after several extensive stays in Europe, relying on the use of a palette knife rather than brushes. Lebron has painted in Europe, particularly London and Paris, in Italy and Spain, in Canada and Mexico. He won such awards as the Forbes Magazine Award (travel grant), and he has had one-man shows at the Galeria Studio in Madrid and in New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois and in his home city ( NYC). Most of his paintings feature favorite characters from his childhood including a tiny dog present in most of his paintings, inspired by the comic strip Dickie Dare. His paintings of the Donner Party are exhibited at the Emigrant Trail Museum at Donner Memorial State Park in Truckee, California. The series of four paintings deals with the struggles of the infamous Donner Party and were commissioned and donated to the museum by Dan Johnson, a Donner Party historian. These paintings were also featured on the History Channel's \"Snowbound in the Sierras\". One of his paintings of Wall Street was used as part of an answer in the Feb. 19, 2013 episode of the game show Jeopardy! In 2012, Lebron published a fictional novel entitled \"The Da Vinci-Picasso Dialogue\"."

In 1927 she took off from New York in the airplane American Girl, with her co-pilot, George Haldeman, in an attempt to become the first woman to duplicate Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic crossing to Paris. Mechanical problems caused them to ditch the plane 360 miles from land, but they established a new over-water endurance flight record of 2,623 miles. It was also at the time the longest flight ever made by a woman. She and George were honored with a ticker-tape parade upon their return. In 1929 she entered the first Women's Air Derby, flying in her Swallow, NC8730, and placed fifth. She starred in Moran of the Marines (1928) and Glorifying the American Girl (1929).She married six times, lastly to Ralph King, to whom she was married for 21 years and who outlived her.

(2012), Euthanasia, Ethics and the Law: From Conflict to Compromise (2007) and (with Dickenson & Parker) The Cambridge Medical Ethics Workbook (CUP, 2nd edn, 2010). He has also produced numerous chapters, and articles for both academic journals and mainstream newspapers. Huxtable is best known for his controversial position on the role of \"principled compromise\" in responding to conflict over the care of a critically ill, incapacitated patient. Huxtable has argued that the law governing both the welfare (or \"best interests\") of the patient and any wishes they might have conveyed, via an \"advance directive\" or through the appointment of a \"lasting power of attorney\", frequently fail to furnish clinicians and families with the guidance they require in these difficult cases. He has proposed that there is a case for \"principled compromise\" here, and has argued for greater ethical engagement, through a reinvigorated system of clinical ethics support, in which committees work alongside the courts to resolve the conflicts that can arise at the limits of life."

He joined the Carnegie staff in July 1905 as an assistant to Charles Davenport, the nation’s most influential eugenicist in the first quarter of the twentieth century. Johnson’s early work involved ladybugs, whose short life cycle made them ideal for studying evolution. He also developed techniques for locating underground petroleum reserves."

  "text" : "Rasha Omran is one of Syria's most well-known poets, intellectuals and reform advocates. She has published four collections of poetry, as well as an anthology of Syrian poetry. Since the beginning of the revolution, she has publicly given her support for the uprising. “This is a dictatorial regime, [....] How can I support a government that kills its citizens?” She has marched in protests, written about her dissent, and spoken out against Assad. Assad is \"not a dictator, just a gangster boss.\" It was Rasha Omran who coined the phrase, \"the international silence on Syria is deafening.\". In September 2012, Rasha Omran and four other Syrian women launched a hunger strike outside the Arab League's headquarters in Tahrir Square, Cairo, Egypt, demanding that the Arab League provide more support for the revolutionaries, and pressure Assad to halt the human rights abuses in Syria."

  "text" : "Raffaello Sernesi (December 25, 1838 – August 9, 1866) was an Italian painter and medallist associated with the Macchiaioli group. He was born in Florence in modest circumstances. After an apprenticeship to a local engraver, he enrolled at the Accademia of Florence in 1856, where he studied under Antonio Ciseri. As part of his training he made copies of the works of quattrocento artists such as Masaccio and Botticelli. In 1858 his father died, and Sernesi left the Academy in order to help support his family as an engraver and medallist. In 1859 he began frequenting the Caffè Michelangiolo and met the artists of the Macchiaioli, including Odoardo Borrani, who became a close friend. Sernesi served as a volunteer in the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859. Upon his return to Florence later that year, he made his first plein air landscape paintings. Norma Broude says these works are characterized by \"the azure and terracotta hues typical both of Tuscany's landscape and its fresco tradition\" and says they reveal \"a taste for rectilinear clarity in spatial and compositional organization\". Sernesi exhibited his painting Pastura in montagna (\"Mountain Pastures\") at the Brera National Exhibition in 1861 and at the Florentine Promotrice in 1862. In 1862 he traveled to Naples and later to Ischia. He exhibited two paintings at the Milan exhibition in 1865. In 1866 he joined Garibaldi's campaign in the Third Italian War of Independence. On July 16 he suffered a serious wound to the leg and was taken prisoner by the Austrians. He was taken to Bolzano for treatment, but his reluctance to have his leg amputated led to his death from gangrene on August 9, 1866."

In 1711, he was a scenic designer in Vienna for the court. He then labored in the Teatro San Cassiano in Le gare generose (1712) by Albinoni and Zaniboni; and for La verità nell'inganno (1713) by Gasparini and Silvani. He prepared scenography and was engineer for performances in Naples, including L'Amor generoso (1714) at the court theater attributed to Scarlatti. In 1714 for the Teatro San Bartolomeo in Naples, he produced scenography for Scipione nella Spagna also by Scarlatti; Pisistrato by Leonardo Leo; Vincislao by Mancini and Apostolo Zeno; Arminio by Scarlatti and Nicola Serino; and Tigrane ovvero L'egual impegno d'amore e di fede, by Scarlatti and Domenico Lolli. In 1716-1719, he worked in England: initially at the King's Theatre and after 1719 as decorator and machinist at the Royal Academy of Music. He was in Portugal from 1735 to 1738, in Paris in 1740 working with the Comédie-Française. Back in Parma in 1739, he is last documented as a scenographer in 1748."

  "text" : "Raymond P. Spillenger (October 24, 1924 – November 20, 2013) was an American painter associated with the New York School. He was born on October 24, 1924, in Brooklyn, to Herbert Spillenger, a postal worker, and Minnie Pines. He showed artistic ability from an early age and won several art prizes in elementary and high school. In 1942 he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and flew a C-47 transport plane over “The Hump” (the Eastern Himalayas) in Burma, China and India, an extremely dangerous assignment, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and other honors. Spillenger returned to the U.S in 1945 and attended Pratt Institute on the G.I. Bill. After graduating in 1948, Spillenger enrolled at Black Mountain College in Asheville, North Carolina, where he studied with Willem de Kooning and Josef Albers and met John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Buckminster Fuller, Kenneth Noland and a number of painters with whom he’d remain close, Pat Passlof and Elaine de Kooning among them. After Black Mountain, he studied in Rome with Giorgio Morandi and Pericle Fazzini, returning in 1950 to New York. Starting in 1950, Spillenger began to leave behind his early figurative work and to experiment with abstraction. His media of choice were oil on canvas, board and paper. He occasionally exhibited during the fifties, and showed works at three New York Painting and Sculpture Annuals at the Stable Galleries, from 1953 to 1955. His work was admired by his peers; Pat Passlof called him “the most brilliant unknown painter of his generation.” He was a regular at The Club, the modern artists’ semi-official discussion venue, and the Cedar Tavern, the unofficial one. In 1955, he married Marian Dennison (née Katz) and with the birth of their first son Paul in 1956, they moved to an apartment at 95 East Tenth Street in the middle of a hub of the New York art scene. Their second son Clyde was born there in 1960. De Kooning’s studio was across the street, at 88 East Tenth Street, Esteban Vicente was in the same building, right across the hall, and his friend Franz Kline lived around the corner on Ninth Street. Tenth Street between Third and Fourth Avenue was then home to a number of artist cooperative galleries (the Tenth Street galleries) such as the Tanager, the Camino, the March and the Brata, which were created to offer alternatives to the uptown galleries that the artists felt were too conservative. Spillenger was a founding member of the March Gallery in 1957. During the 1950s and 1960s, Spillenger produced a large number of abstract paintings. The influence of Arshile Gorky, de Kooning, Kline and Hans Hoffman on these works is unmistakable, but they retain their own identity and integrity. By the mid 1970s, the New York art scene as Spillenger knew it had dispersed. Some painters (Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Kline) had died, others (de Kooning) had become wealthy and moved out of New York; many more either gave up painting or moved to more congenial places to raise their children. At the same time, Spillenger felt the galleries and the art scene in general had become more corrupt than ever before. He wanted no part of it, and soon he stopped painting entirely. Fifteen years later, now in his late sixties, he came back to art with a vengeance. He began attending life drawing classes and churning out hundreds and hundreds of works on paper, mostly figurative, which still showed the command of movement, line and form that had characterized his abstract work. He continued painting, drawing and revising until 2011, when advanced dementia made it impossible for him to work. He died in 2013, one of the very last abstract expressionists to pass. Works by Raymond Spillenger can be found in the collections of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minn., and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. He was subject of an exhibition at the Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center January 22 – May 21, 2016. The show travels to the Neuberger Museum of Art September 11 - December 23, 2016. A catalogue raisonné of his work is now in preparation by his son, Paul Spillenger."

  "text" : "Ruth Leah Bunzel (born Bernheim) (18 April 1898 – 14 January 1990) was an American anthropologist, known for her studies of the Zuni people and of alcoholism in two Latin American villages. She started her career as the secretary of Franz Boas, founder of anthropology at Columbia University, who encouraged her to take up anthropology directly. Bunzel became interested in the Zuni from having visited the people with anthropologist Ruth Benedict from Columbia, and because she was fascinated with the prominent role of women as potters in Zuni society. Her 1929 PhD dissertation, Pueblo Potter, describes the creative process of Zuni potters, who preserve and reproduce traditional patterns even as individual potters innovate and create new ones. She was one of the first anthropologists to study the creative process. She later said, \"Look, I was never studying pottery. I was studying human behavior. I wanted to know how the potters felt about what they were doing.\" Similarly, when studying drinking patterns in the Mexican and Guatemalan villages, she said she was not studying alcohol. She studied \"people and their drinking habits as seen in their cultural contexts and the influences behind these habits.\""

Alami maintained a policy of not entering Israel proper after Gaza was occupied, but entered on 11 January 1970 to petition the Israeli authorities to discontinue the practice of destroying Palestinian houses in retaliation for Palestinian fedayeen attacks. During his time in office, his son was imprisoned by the Israeli authorities and his car, truck, factory and citrus trees had been confiscated because of failure to pay income taxes. After Alami challenged Israel's move to connect the Gaza Strip to Israel's electricity grid, he was dismissed from the municipality.

Many of the stories are set in locations he would have known. The subject matter is a mixture of detective, crime and mystery. He lived in Clapham in West London with his wife and three children, Margret, Sarah and David. He died at the age of 52, just as he was becoming known as a popular writer. His books were still published for a number of years after his death. Copies of the books are kept in the National Library in London and are available on line now they have been digitised."

Born to Daniel and Clara (Rutherford) Gettens, Rutherford John Gettens grew up in Mooers, New York, where he became valedictorian of his high school class in 1918. He received his B.S. from Middlebury College in 1923. On graduating, he taught chemistry at Colby College, Maine, before receiving his M.A. from Harvard University in 1929. In 1928, Gettens began working at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard, and by 1949, he was chief of Museum Technical Research, and an active member in the development of the field of conservation as we know it today. In 1951, Gettens began the establishment of a 'Technical Laboratory' at the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. The laboratory was designed to conduct technical research as well as undertake conservation treatments of museum objects. By 1961, he had been appointed head curator of the laboratory and after his retirement in 1968, he served as a research consultant until his death. Gettens was a founding member of the International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, which was incorporated in 1948. He was later to serve as council member and vice president, as well as president from 1968 to 1971. He was Coordinator of Working Groups for the International Council of Museums,a consulting fellow at the Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, and on the science advisory board of the Winterthur Museum. He also received a Fulbright lectureship in Greece, and was the inspiration behind the American Institute for Conservation Oral History Project. He wrote extensively in the conservation field. His works include The Freer Chinese Bronzes (Volume II), and, with George L. Stout, Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopedia."

  "text" : "Roger A. Graham (12 June 1885 Providence, Rhode Island – 25 October 1938 Chicago) was an American lyricist, composer, singer, and music publisher who flourished from 1906 to 1920 — a period that included World War I, the golden age of Tin Pan Alley (from about 1915 to 1920), the dawn of the Jazz Age (circa 1914), and the silent film era. Graham was a proponent of vaudeville and burlesque songs. But as a lyricist and publisher, Graham is most remembered for having been an exponent of blues songs. From about 1914 to 1919, Graham's success and popularity as lyricist and publisher led to close friendships with stars of the stage and silent screen — George M. Cohan, Sophie Tucker, Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, and many others. But after failing to have a hit as a writer or publisher for three or four years, and a year after the start of prohibition, Graham quit writing music and publishing in 1921 and took a job as a department manager at Mandell Brothers, a large department store. In 1938, nine years after the Wall Street Crash and in the throes of the Great Depression, Graham died alone and penniless in the Cook County Hospital charity ward, reportedly unknown to those attending him and without any kin or friend mourning at his side. Graham's remains would have been interred in a pauper's grave were it not for an alert attendant at the Cook County Morgue, who, after recognizing his name on a list, contacted a sister, Elizabeth (Mrs. Lawrence Joseph Mulhearn; 1887–1982) of Bronxville, New York, and his ex-wife of 8 years, May Olivette Hill (1888–1978) of Los Angeles. According to Hill, his lyrics from \"I Ain't Got Nobody\", and other melancholy songs that made him popular, seemed to foreshadow his decline and ensuing loneliness."

In 1928, Charles Mintz bought out the contracts of the animators (including Hamilton) and the rights to the Oswald character from Disney. A year later, Hamilton helped fellow animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising establish their own animation studio. He was one of the primary animators for the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. From 1929 to 1934, he animated the Bosko character in the Harman and Ising studio. He was one of the few animators who remained with Leon Schlesinger after Harman and Ising left in 1933. In Schlesinger's studio, he animated Buddy, Beans the Cat, and Porky Pig. He then worked as a freelance animator until 1940. He died in 1951 of a heart attack."

  "text" : "Padmashree Ranjana Gauhar is a leading exponent of the Indian Classical dance - Odissi, an ancient dance style which originated, centuries ago, in the temples of Orissa. For her commitment, deep devotion and dedication to Odissi she has been honored with the prestigious Padma Shree in 2003 and with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for the year 2007 by the President of India. Ranjana's tryst with Odissi began quite early in life. Born with a passion to use body as a language for the soul, Ranjana's thirst for innovation took her to different forms and mediums of art. As a child, she dabbled in painting, dance and theatre. But it was Odissi that finally captured her heart and soul and she trained under the legendary guru - Guru Mayadhar Raut. She sharpened her sensitivities by taking up Philosophy for graduation and English Literature for MA and enriched her experience as a dancer by also learning Kathak and Manipuri dance styles. Padmashree Ranjana Gauhar views life as an extension of her dance. She has perfected and honed her skillsin Odissi to create her own distinctive style and signature in the art form.She has even experimented with Chhau dance – Orissa's martial art form - and successfully blended it with her own inimitable style of Odissi. She has also produced and directed a number of professional ballets depicting contemporary and mythological themes. Furthermore, Ranjana ji is an independent film producer, researcher and scriptwriter and has successfully produced many television serials, films, and documentaries. Her contribution to the propagation of Odissi is her book titled ‘Odissi – The Dance Divine', released in February, 2007. Padmashree Ranjana Gauhar has traveled with her art of Odissi dance across the length and breadth of the country. She has participated in prestigious dance festivals including Khajuraho Festival, Kalidas Festival in Ujjain and Smt. Rukmini Devi Arundale Centenary Festival at Kalakshetra.

Bob Hamilton co-wrote both sides with Joanne Bratton-Jackson. Batiste also recorded with Golden World Records in 1966, singing \"Sweetheart Darling\", written by Al and Bob Hamilton, Joe Hunter, and Richard Morris, with \"That's What He Told Me\" also on the album.

She was the Pastoral Associate at St. Mark Catholic Church in Wheaton, Illinois. She went on to found Bethlehem Center which is now called the Northern Illinois Food Bank. Through her experience with the St. Mark's Food Pantry, she witnessed the devastating effects of both spiritual and material poverty. Too many children were going to bed and suffered from malnurished, it is hard to imagine that hunger exists in the US but it does. So serious was the problem that the US Senate set up a select committee to look into the issue. In response to this need, Sister Rosemarie assembled a group of people to work with her on this project. They became the first board of directors: Bonnie Goodman, Cathy Truesdale, Jim Truesdale, Clevis Cabrera, Joyce Shannon, Nick Hindman, Paul Wood, Barb Williams and Willie Williams. Sister Rosemarie also met with many local leaders, Leah Krantz, from The Greater Chicago Food Depository  and Bernie Kleina, the Executive Director of the Hope Fair Housing Center. It was also discovered that thousands of pounds of edible food was going into landfills. The board contacted manufacturers and grocery stores to try to recover some of it. They realized a food bank could be a way of recovering and distributing this much needed food. The name Bethlehem, meaning \"House of Bread\" was chosen. Sister Rosemarie was officially named the first Executive Director on September 28, 1982. What began as a way to help solve what was thought to be a temporary problem, has grown  and as of June 2012, one in five children in Northern Illinois face hunger. Burian left to pursue other interests in December 1986. She went on to be a chaplain then a Spiritual Director and is currently teaching classes in Meditation and Mindfulness at the Tau Center, a spirituality ministry of the Wheaton Franciscans."

  "text" : "Richard Kidder Meade (July 11, 1746 – February 9, 1805) was an American army officer from Nansemond County, Virginia. His grandfather had been Sir Richard Everard, 4th Baronet, the last Governor of North Carolina under proprietary rule. His great-great-grandfather was Richard Kidder, a noted theologian who was the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Meade was educated at Harrow, England, one of the oldest and most respected schools in England. In October 1775, he was commissioned captain of the 2nd Virginia Regiment. He led a company at the Battle of Great Bridge near Chesapeake, Virginia, arguably the first Revolutionary War battle in the state of Virginia. In March 1777, Meade was appointed as one of Washington's aides-de-camps. He was frequently used to deliver important dispatches and orders. Alexander Hamilton did the \"head work\" for Washington while he did the riding. Meade was given the rank of colonel, or possibly lieutenant colonel. He was with Washington during all of his major battles. Meade supervised the execution of Major Andre. In 1780, he left Washington's staff to get married for the second time in Virginia. He was originally married to Elizabeth Randolph, a daughter of Richard Randolph. His second wife was the widow of William Randolph of Chatsworth. While in Virginia he aided General von Steuben in repelling an attack of British forces under Benedict Arnold. He owned Meadea at White Post, Virginia and built Lucky Hit about 1791. Both are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. He died in 1805 apparently from the effects of gout and years of military life. His son was William Meade, the third Episcopal Bishop of Virginia. Richard Kidder Meade (1803-1862), the U.S. Representative from Virginia, was a son of another Richard Kidder Meade (1775-1832). All were descendents of David Meade (1700-1787) who married Susannah Everard, a daughter of Sir Richard Everard, 4th Baronet, the former governor of North Carolina."
