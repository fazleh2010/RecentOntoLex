  "text" : "Samuel Checote (1819 - 1884) was a full-blood Muskogee Creek Indian who was noted as a Methodist minister and as the first principal chief of the tribe after the Civil War. He was born in the Chattahoochee Valley near Fort Mitchell, Alabama. In 1829, he moved to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma), where he and his family settled near the present-day town of Okmulgee. Samuel attended the Asbury Manual Labor School, near Fort Mitchell. Later, he attended an academy founded by John Harrell, a Methodist missionary, who persuaded Checote to devote the rest of his life to preaching to the Creeks. He did this until the Lower Creek Council in 1832 and 1844 passed a law forbidding any tribal member to preach. Checote and several other Creek preachers fled and remained outside the Creek Nation until they had made an appeal to Chief Roley McIntosh, who repealed the law. In 1852, Checote joined the Indian Mission Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. He continued his preaching career until the Civil War began. He enlisted in the Confederate Army as captain of Company B of the First Regiment of Creek Mounted Volunteers on August 13, 1861, and on August 19, 1861, he became lieutenant colonel of his regiment. He and his regiment participated in several actions against Union forces, including the 1864 Battle of Cabin Creek and a skirmish at Pryor Creek. After the end of the Civil War, Checote resumed his career as a preacher and served as a circuit rider and as a presiding elder of the Indian Mission. Samuel Checote was elected as principal chief of the Creek Nation in 1867, the first to serve under the new postwar Creek constitution. He was reelected to a second term in 1871. Checote's skills as a political leader were tested soon after his first election. Many of the Creeks were traditionalists who opposed assimilation into the white man's way of life. This group, initially led by Locha Harjo, formed a rival government based in the town of Nuyaka. After the death of Locha Harjo, the group turned to Isparhecher, a former Checotah supporter, as their chief. The conflict escalated until Checote called on the Creek light horsemen, led by Pleasant Porter, to put down the movement. In February 1883, Porter's force defeated the Nuyaka rebels in a battle that came to be known as the \"Peach Orchard War.\" The Methodist Church, South, chose Checote as a delegate to the Ecumenical Council in London, England, where Methodists from all over the world in 1882. He was unable to attend because of illness. He died at his home in Okmulgee on September 3, 1884."

Herbert wrote in New Humanist in 2004: \"But if comedy is catharsis, then, based on\" its \"list of troubles ... the Catholic Church is in real need of some laughter. Wouldn't such sounds be more welcome than the gasps of horror usually accompanying any article or programme about the Catholic Church?\" Herbert is a co-host, with husband Max Keiser, of The Keiser Report on RT, and Double Down on Radio Sputnik."

  "text" : "Shannon Dorey (born 1955) is a Canadian author best known for her research on the African Dogon people. She is a graduate of Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada where she graduated with a combined English and History degree. Her interests were expanded into religious studies after studying the New Testament at the University of Windsor in 1991. Dorey has written three books analyzing the symbols found in the Dogon religion based on the work of ethnographers Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen. In The Master of Speech, published in 2002, Dorey analyzes the information which Griaule recorded in the light of scientific advances which have taken place in the last fifty or sixty years. In The Nummo, published in 2004, Dorey hypothesizes that the Dogon religion is an extremely ancient oral tradition with traces of it being found in most ancient religions of the world. In Day of the Fish, published in 2012, she compares the Nummo, described by the Dogon elder Ogotemmêli, to the goddesses of the Neolithic period as defined by the Lithuanian-American archeologist, Marija Gimbutas. In 2010 Dorey wrote a popular article for New Dawn magazine comparing the Australian Rainbow Serpent to the Dogon Nummo, who were also described as being rainbow serpents."

During his most productive years, Neckelmann worked as an associate with the German architect August Hartel, who was ten years his elder. They designed many buildings together, including, in Strasbourg: \n*  1888–1892: National Theatre (built to house the legislative assembly of the German Imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine, of which Strasbourg was the capital from 1871 to 1918) \n*  1889–1893: Catholic Church of Saint Peter the Younger \n*  1889–1895: the National University Library When Hartel died in Strasbourg in 1890, Neckelmann was obliged to see through alone all the projects which they had conceived together. He went on to design the Strasbourg Palais de Justice (1894 - 1898) alone, but it was his last major project. In 1901 he ceased all professional activity for health reasons. Neckelmann spent many years in Stuttgart. For many years he ran an architect's cabinet in Stuttgart (where the architect Johann Emil Schaudt once worked). He also taught architecture in Stuttgart. One of his pupils was Georg Stähelin. He is the author of a number of books in German, mostly on architecture, but also a book on Danish philosophers of the Renaissance (Denkmäler der Renaissance in Dänemark). Neckelmann and Hartel also designed the Christ Church, Cologne, and the Haus des Wirtschaft (1889-1896) in Stuttgart, which is now a museum."

  "text" : "Shimon Attie (born Los Angeles in 1957 ) is an American visual artist. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2008, The Rome Prize in 2001 and a Visual Artist Fellowship from Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advance Study in 2007. His work spans a variety of media, including photography, site-specific installation, multiple channel immersive video installation, performance, and new media. Much of Attie’s practice explores how a wide range of contemporary media may be used to re-imagine new relationships between space, time, place, and identity. Much, though not all, of Attie’s work in the 90s dealt with the history of the second world war. He first garnered significant international attention by slide projecting images of past Jewish life onto contemporary locations in Berlin.  More recent projects have involved using a range of media to engage local communities to find new ways of representing their history, memory and potential futures. Attie’s artworks and interventions are site-specific and immersive in nature, and tend to engage subject matter that is both social, political and psychological. In 2013, Shimon Attie was awarded the Lee Krasner Award for Lifetime Achievement in Art."

  "text" : "Shirley Erena Murray (born 31 March 1931) is a New Zealand hymn lyrics writer. Her hymns have been translated into numerous languages and are represented in more than 140 hymn collections. Born a Methodist in Invercargill, she earned a Master of Arts degree with honours in Classics and French from the University of Otago. She later worked as a teacher and researcher. After marrying Presbyterian minister John Murray in 1954, she eventually moved to Wellington where John was minister for the St Andrew's on the Terrace from 1975 to 1993. Her hymn writing started in the 1970s and often used the congregation of St Andrew's as a testing place for the hymns. Many different composers have put music to her hymn texts. Her hymns have been translated into several European and Asian languages and are represented in more than 140 hymn books around the world. In addition to New Zealand, they are particularly used in North America. Among her most known hymns are \"Hymn for Anzac Day\", \"Where Mountains Rise to Open Skies\", \"Our life has its Seasons\", \"Star Child\" and \"Upside Down Christmas\". Professor and hymn writer Colin Gibson, who has set music to some of her songs, described Murray's hymns in 2009 as \"distinguished by their inclusive language and their innovative use of Māori, their bold appropriation of secular terms and their original poetic imagery drawn from nature and domestic life, but equally by the directness with which they confront contemporary issues.\" In 2001, she became a member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for \"services as a hymn writer\". In 2006, she became a fellow of the Royal School of Church Music. She received an honorary doctor of literature degree from the University of Otago in 2009. The same year, she was named a fellow of the Hymn Society in the United States and Canada. Murray lives with her husband at Raumati Beach near Wellington. The couple has three children and several grandchildren."

  "text" : "Sarah Arvio (born April 3, 1954) is an American poet, essayist and translator. She is the author of Visits from the Seventh, Sono: cantos, and night thoughts: 70 dream poems & notes from an analysis (all from Alfred A. Knopf) and a combined edition of Sono and Visits from the Seventh, from Bloodaxe. She has won the Rome Prize in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Guggenheim fellowship, a Bogliasco fellowship, and a National Endowment for the Arts Translation Fellowship, and other honors. Arvio has been widely published in journals and magazines. Her work has also appeared in many anthologies, including The Best American Poetry 2015, The Best American Poetry 1998, The Best American Erotic Poetry, Women’s Work, the FSG Book of 20th Century Italian Poetry, the Oxford Book of Latin American Short Stories, and Ariadne’s Thread: A Collection of Contemporary Women’s Journals. The poet and philosopher John Koethe, in his citation for Arvio’s Boston Review prize, said this: “The idea of the distinctive poetic voice…seems central to Sarah Arvio’s poetry, which sounds like no one else’s. Yet the voice in her poems seems to emanate from a kind of psychic doppelganger, originating from an imagined self somewhere outside her and passing through her on the way to the reader. It writes the self from which it issues, rather than the other way around, and is constructed out of wordplay and verbal associations… The results are poems that possess both an eerie psychological presence and a blunt verbal materiality.” Her poems have been set to music: William Bolcom set “Chagrin” for mezzo-soprano and chamber ensemble in a song cycle entitled \"The Hawthorn Tree” (which also adapts poems by Louise Bogan, Willa Cather, Anne Carson, Stevie Smith and Elinor Wylie). Steven Burke set “Armor” in a monodrama entitled “Skin,” for mezzo-soprano and cello. Miriama Young composed “Côte d’Azur” as \"Inner Voices of Blue,\" first for tenor and chamber ensemble, later resetting it for mezzo-soprano. She was the translator and poetry editor for the film, Azul: Land of Poets (1988), directed by Roland Legiardi-Laura. She also worked as a research associate for the landmark film series on American poets, Voices & Visions, which aired on PBS in 1988. Arvio has lived in Caracas, Mexico City, Paris, Rome and New York.She works as a translator for the United Nations in New York and Switzerland; she has also taught poetry at Princeton."

  "text" : "Samuel Peter Mackay (1864 – 11 May 1923) was a pastoralist and businessman in Western Australia. His parents were pioneers from the Isle of Skye who settled in Victoria in 1852. Mackay was born in 1864 and was educated at Mount Gambier Grammar School but left at age 13. He worked as a drover and a surveyor before deciding to move to Western Australia along with his father, Donald MacKay, and uncles, Roderick Mackay and Donald McDonald. Together the men worked in the pearling industry in the North West region. De Grey Station was owned by Mackay in 1875 and was briefly managed by George Julius Brockman for three months of the same year while Mackay travelled to Melbourne. Realising the pastoral prospects of the country, the men bought the 1,000,000 acres (4,047 km2) Mundabullangana Station in about 1880. The Mackays were involved in the racing industry and in breeding horses on the station. Following the death of his father in 1903 Mackay bought out his uncles and became the sole owner of the property. MacKay bought and sold many stations throughout the northwest part of Western Australia; J. G. Meares sold his share of Sherlock Station to Mackay in 1910. Later the same year, Mackay acquired the Springs station, which he sold in 1910 to S.L. Burges. In 1911, MacKay unsuccessfully bid £25,000 for the Croydon Station, which adjoins Pyramid Station. MacKay acquired Croydon at a later date and sold the 460,000 acres (1,862 km2) property stocked with 12,000 sheep in 1921.At one time Mackay had also acquired Balmoral Station from James Munro; he later sold it to B. H. Sharpe and Company. Mackay left Western Australia in 1905 and returned to Victoria while retaining his pastoral interests. He bought Melville Park where he lived until 1912, then moved to St Kilda and eventually to Rock House Estate near Kyneton, where he hoped to establish a horse stud. In early 1922, while in Perth, MacKay had to have his leg amputated. He eventually returned to Melbourne but died on 11 May 1923 while in hospital. He was buried at Brighton Cemetery three days later with several prominent members of the racing community acting as pall-bearers."

Appointed commander of the RAF Search and Rescue Force in 2013, she is the highest-ranking female aircrew officer in British military history. Having graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) degree, Mackmin received a short service commission in the Women's Royal Air Force as a pilot officer in the General Duties Branch (i.e. aircrew) on 17 February 1991. As a graduate, on 17 September 1991 she was promoted flying officer with seniority from 17 February 1990. She was promoted flight lieutenant on 17 August 1993. The WRAF fully assimilated into the RAF in 1994 and Mackmin (or Slingsby as she then was) converted to a permanent commission on 22 August 1996. She qualified as a helicopter pilot in 1994 and flew Puma helicopters in the Bosnian War in 1995 and in Northern Ireland in 1997. She then qualified as the first female helicopter instructor in the British Armed Forces in 1998. She was promoted squadron leader on 1 July 2000 and later that year became the first female commander of a flying unit. On 1 July 2006, she was promoted wing commander, and in 2008 took command of No. 202 Squadron RAF, flying Westland Sea King helicopters in the search and rescue role. Mackmin has also served three tours as a staff officer at the Ministry of Defence, most recently, before her promotion to group captain in 2013, as personal staff officer to the Assistant Chief of the Air Staff. She also volunteers with the RAF Mountain Rescue Service at RAF Valley, where she is based, and competes in equestrian events."

Treat was first elected to the Maine House in 1990 and served until 1996. From 1996 to 2004, Treat served as a State Senator, including a term (2002–04) as the Senate Majority Leader. Unable to run for re-election to the State Senate in 2004, Treat returned to the House. She was replaced by Scott Cowger (D-Hallowell)."

  "text" : "Steven Kolb is president and chief executive officer of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), a group of over 500 American fashion womenswear, menswear, jewelry, and accessories designers. He holds a Masters in Public Administration from New York University. In May 2014 Kolb received an honorary doctorate of the Arts from Kendall College of Art and Design at Ferris State University in Grand Rapids, Michigan.. The Business of Fashion ranks Kolb as one of 500 people shaping the global fashion industry. Kolb manages the CFDA’s membership, trade association activities, and longstanding philanthropic initiatives such as Fashion Targets Breast Cancer, which raises public awareness and funds for breast cancer research in the U.S. and internationally. Furthermore, he has overseen raising funds for natural disasters such as Fashion for Sandy, which raised funds after Hurricane Sandy and for HIV/AIDS through initiatives such as 7th on Sale. Kolb works directly with CFDA Board Chair Diane von Furstenberg and the Board of Directors, which is composed of America’s foremost designers, such as Vera Wang, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Ashley Olsen, Prabal Gurung, and Deborah Lloyd]]. One of Kolb’s largest contributions to American fashion has been his leadership role in cultivating the next wave of emerging American fashion talent through programs such as the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund (CVFF) and the CFDA {FASHION INCUBATOR}. Kolb serves as a judge for CVFF and is featured on \"The Fashion Fund,\" an original unscripted series documenting CVFF. Furthermore, under Kolb’s guidance, the annual CFDA Fashion Awards has become the preeminent spotlight on American fashion, even being called the Oscars of Fashion. Under his direction, the CFDA worked with the Boston Consulting group to conduct an extensive study to evaluate the purpose of New York Fashion Week. The intent of the study was to question the status quo of fashion week and stimulate a dialogue in the American fashion industry. Kolb has also worked to establish the Strategic Partnerships Group (SPG) at the CFDA. This group works to strategically align corporate partners with the CFDA’s members, in an effort to leverage and add value to both the partner and the designer, respectively. Charlotte Ronson and Stacey Bendet of Alice & Olivia created limited-edition items for Starbucks as a result of one of these symbiotic partner and designer relationships. Furthermore, Kolb has helped pave the way for the CFDA’s Health Initiative, which was formed to address the overwhelming concern about whether some models are unhealthily thin, and how to implement best practices in such cases. Kolb also works tirelessly to keep a designer’s original designs intact through efforts such as the Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act. Moreover, Kolb works with international counterparts to manage the global fashion week schedule. Kolb has helped develop the Fashion Manufacturing Initiative, which is an investment fund to help revitalize New York City’s garment industry. The program offers matching financial grants to New York City’s fashion manufacturing production facilities looking to grow and sustain their business by acquiring of innovative equipment, expanding their services, training workers, and creating professional development programming. A major accomplishment, Kolb successfully led CFDA's effort to acquire the Fashion Calendar—the official schedule of fashion events and shows in New York, including New York Fashion Week. In July 2015, under Kolb's leadership, New York Fashion Week: Men's launched creating a stand-alone fashion week for American menswear that aligns with the men's market."

  "text" : "Samuel Touchet (ca. 1705 – 28 May 1773) was an English cotton merchant, manufacturer and politician. Born in Manchester, he was himself the son of a cotton trader and manufacturer and he started his career representing his father's business in London. His career importing raw cotton from the Levant and the West Indies was successful to the extent that manufacturers in Manchester began to suspect him of seeking a monopoly. In 1742 he became involved with the Birmingham inventors Lewis Paul and John Wyatt, who had designed the first machinery to successfully spin cotton mechanically, receiving a grant for 300 spindles off Wyatt. In 1744 Touchet and a partner called Bowker set the spindles up at Touchet's Mill in Birmingham in association with Paul and with assistance from Wyatt. Little is known of the fate of this mill, but it was sufficiently successful for Touchet later to secure the lease of Marvel's Mill in Northampton, another of the Paul-Wyatt cotton mills, from Edward Cave. As Touchet became very wealthy over the course of the 1750s his business interests diversified into shipping, insurance broking and the sugar and slave trades. Touchet became the MP for Shaftesbury in 1761 but his business foundered that year's financial crisis and was taken over by his creditors in 1763, with Touchet remaining an MP until 1768."

When the decision was made by station owner Westinghouse to take it from a mixed radio and news format to an all-news one, he was enlisted to help organize the transition. The changeover took place on April 19, 1965. Brooks next spent several years as an executive and a national reporter for Westinghouse. Then, in 1970, he undertook the role of a local reporter. He continued to be on the air from that time until he filed his last report from City Hall about a month before his death at the age of 86. On December 17, 2013, just a week before his death, Mayor Michael Bloomberg renamed the press room at New York City Hall in his honor. Brooks and his wife had lived at Manhattan Plaza for years, and the corner of Tenth Avenue and 43rd Street was renamed Stan Brooks Way in his honor in September 2014. Brooks's wife Lynn predeceased him in May 2013. The couple is survived by their three sons George, Rick and Bennett."

Being a part of a city that has a rich cultural heritage, he was naturally inclined towards the art of sculpture. At the age of 13, he got an opportunity to get trained under stalwarts like Late Guru Bhubaneswar Mohapatra and Late Guru Kunia Moharana of Puri. His innovative and extravagant style of creating sculptures took him altogether at a different level in the aesthetic World of Art and Crafts. When Shree Sahoo developed Sudarshan Crafts Museum, Puri in 1977, he almost became a father figure in the development of traditional sculptures. It provides a platform to the upcoming artists to display their raw talent in front of art lovers all over the World. The Museum is a symbolic meeting point for people interested in the art of sculptures.The Gurukul system of learning relived the tradition again when Sudarshan Sahoo established Sudarshan Art & Crafts Village, Bhubaneswar in 1991 with the help of the Government of Odisha. The institution is a Training and Creative Centre for traditional sculptures made of stone, wood and fiberglass sculptures. Sudarshan Sahoo’s exemplary dedication and determination has created a style of his own which boasts of applying numerous techniques in temple carvings. Sudarshan Sahoo has recreated magic with his visionary qualities for the art of sculpture, which is a gift to the world of art and mankind too. Sahoo's greatest strength has been the active support and help of his wife Arnapurna. Both his sons Rabi and Surya are now actively involved in his work."

Over a hundred of her portraits in watercolour and gouache on paper were published in the 1825 edition of Lucy Aikin's Memoirs of the Court of Queen Elizabeth, first published in 1818 as a two-volume work and re-issued in several editions (4th edition 1819, further edition 1823). She was knowledgeable in the field of heraldry and frequently added the subject's coat of arms and other heraldic devices to her copy portraits."

Although he was from Lucca, he was probably not count of Lucca. He moved from Tuscany to Emilia-Romagna c.924-930 when Hugh of Italy endowed him with lands around Parma. Sigifred also gained control of lands around Brescia.

He landed on 1 January 1843, and held the post of Master in Equity, together with that of Chief Commissioner of Insolvent Estates, until his appointment as Resident Judge in the district of Moreton Bay (now Queensland) in January 1856. Then he returned to Sydney in February 1859, and was a Supreme Court Judge till his death on 26 May 1865 in Maitland, New South Wales.

  "text" : "Susie Schmitt Hanson (1860–1956) was a milliner, dressmaker and entrepreneur from Minnesota. As the owner of one of Waconia's longest-running businesses, she remains a prominent figure in the history of that town. Susan \"Susie\" Schmitt was born on August 13, 1860 in the village of Chaska. She was one of eight children of John and Rosina Schmitt. The others were Andrew, Casper, Anna, Caroline, Bernice, and twins Joseph and Josephine. Schmitt was a talented seamstress from a young age. She turned that gift into a career spanning nearly seven decades, working on quilts, dresses, hats, hat pins, and more. Susie Schmitt first entered the millinery (hat making) business in 1888 as an apprentice for four years in the city of St. Paul. Afterward, she returned to Chaska to run a dressmaking business. That business operated for twelve years. In 1898, Schmitt opened her own dressmaking and millinery shop in Waconia. Four years later, she moved the shop to a prime location on Main Street after purchasing the A. Ed. Kauder property for $2,300. At this new location, the store focused on millinery. Schmitt operated the business for forty-eight years, until she sold it to Mrs. Elva Ellison in 1946. She continued making and remodeling hats in a smaller shop. Schmitt also maintained scrapbooks of newspaper clippings of weddings, obituaries and key events, which are now in the Carver County Historical Society collection along with many of her photographs and examples of her work as a milliner. In July, 1912, Susie Schmitt married Charles Hanson, a local carpenter born in March 1861. The couple never had children of their own, leaving Schmitt to care for and spoil her nieces and nephews. After Hanson died on June 16, 1932, Schmitt outlived him by twenty-three years, until her own death on October 7, 1956 at the age of ninety-six."

  "text" : "Scott Svonkin is an elected Trustee of the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD). Svonkin was elected as a trustee of LACCD in on May 17, 2011. He is one of seven on the Board of Trustees for the LACCD, the largest community college district in the United States. He currently serves as the Board’s PresidentSvonkin ran as a candidate seeking to reform the bidding and construction policies of LACCD. Prior to his election the Los Angeles Times “investigation found tens of millions of dollars” from the LACCD’s $5.7 billion bond construction program “had been wasted because of lax oversight, questionable spending, poor workmanship and inadequate planning.”As this information came forward it was learned that the LACCD lacked formal policies on for spending the money from construction bonds. After he was elected to the LACCD Board, Svonkin pushed for a policy that would provide greater oversight to the use of bond funds. The LACCD Board approved this policy. The California State Controller’s Office also found that prior to Svonkin’s election the LACCD had failed to follow “its own bidding rules in choosing someone with no experience in audits or investigations over higher-rated applicants” when the district had hired its inspector general.“Scott Svonkin, one of two people who joined the seven-member board in July, was the only trustee to speak in favor of an independent investigation.”"

The abbess was entrusted with the task of bringing nuns from her monastery to the new one which would be governed by the Rule of Saint Benedict. When Vela Gutiérrez, her husband, died, the nuns returned the new monastery, the construction of which was not yet completed, to Sancha who, in 1164, donated it to the Monastery of Santa María de Moreruela that had been founded by her father, Count Ponce, and it was then turned into a monastery governed by the Cistercian Order. She had previously made arrangements to have three sarcophagi carved from stone; one for her deceased husband, another one for a son who had died previously, and one for herself. These were placed in the main chapel of the church of Nogales Abbey which had been consecrated in 1172. Sancha died in 1176 and her remains, as well as those of her husband and son, received burial at the newly founded monastery."

She was cast in a supporting role in The Accused but was left demoralized at her treatment by the overbearing director William Dieterle. Dalbert did not develop as a leading star, but appeared in a mixture of small roles in larger budget films while playing the female lead in B Pictures such as Trail of the Yukon (1949). From 1951 onwards she appeared mostly in television before retiring in 1957 and returning to her native France."

Sergio Castellitto explained his first encounter with Aksoy in an article on Vogue Turkey with these words: \"Saadet, the first time I met you it was through the internet. I had accidentally 'fallen' on a movie trailer. I actually don’t remember anything of that trailer, of that movie. Yet I remember that I saw a woman turning her head abruptly to the camera, her blue eyes burning everything in that framing, blasting the reverse shot.\" Saadet Aksoy has been in the juries of such film festivals as Cairo International Film Festival, Sarajevo Film Festival and Istanbul Film Festival. She became the spokesperson for L'Oreal Paris in Turkey in the year 2013."

She began working for him on September 1, 1969 and was his assistant for decades. Kupcinet taught her the basics of good journalism, and she said his integrity and personality contributed to their getting \"scoops\" through a hot line where people could call in news. As Kupcinet aged, Foster collaborated with him and she later received a byline under the Kupcinet column. She began her writing career in the mid-1980s with a regular column, \"Starlights by Stella\", that appeared in Sister 2 Sister magazine; started her own column, \"Stella's Column\", for the Chicago Sun-Times on December 2, 2003 and after the death of Kupcinet, and retired on her birthday August 6, 2012. During her career, she also had a regular television segment on FOX News called \"Stella Sez.\" The column for the Chicago Sun-Times ran two times a week and was later increased to five times a week.

Sir Walter Coppinger was the eldest son of James Coppinger, and the great grandson of Stephen Coppinger who was the first representative of the city of Cork in the Parliament of Ireland in 1560, and Mayor of Cork on two occasions, in 1564 and 1572. Sir Walter was a moneylender, and acquired many lands and properties from people who defaulted on mortgages provided by Sir Walter. This made his somewhat unpopular and his reputation in Cork to this day reflects this."

Hickey received a primary education but at the age of thirteen left school to work as a drayman's assistant, eventually being apprenticed to a Mudgee saddler in 1893. He worked in Sydney for the saddler's firm, which failed. Around 1909 he married Hilda Ellen Dacey, daughter of Labor MP John Dacey. In 1912 he entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Labor member for Alexandria; he moved to the multi-member seat of Botany in 1920. On 13 December 1921 he was elected Speaker, but eight days later the Dooley Labor Government fell and Hickey was ousted. His term remains the shortest in the history of the Assembly. He was defeated in 1922 but in 1925 was given a life appointment to the New South Wales Legislative Council, which he held until the Council's reconstitution in 1934. Hickey died in 1958 at Bellevue Hill. His son was Sir Justin Hickey."

  "text" : "Louis Stanislas Xavier Verroust (1814 – 1863) was a French composer and oboist. Verroust was born May 10, 1814 in Hazebrouck. He received 2nd prize in Gustave Vogt's class in oboe in 1833, then first prize the next year. Also a fine violinist, he became 2nd violinist in the orchestra of the Palais-Royal in 1831. He taught oboe at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1853 to 1860, succeeding Gustave Vogt in this position and preceding Charles Triébert. His published compositions, many of which included parts for oboe, numbered at least 7 dozen (with Op.85, his next-to-last solo de concert, published posthumously- possibly Op.86 as well). He died either 9 or 11 April 1863 also in Hazebrouck."

He holds a Doctoral degree on the subject of the mutual influence of the Jewish and Indian cultures. Lev teaches at the Hadassah Academic College. Lev is the author of \"Soulmates\", the story of Mahatma Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach (Orient BlackSwan, 2012), the first comprehensive study analyzing the unique and enigmatic relationship between Gandhi and his closest intimate friend and supporter, Hermann Kallenbach, in the context of his developing in his formative years in South Africa, and in the understanding of his relationship to the Zionist movement. The Hindu found it \"insightful\" and \"a valuable addition to Gandhi studies for the historian\". In particular the book debunks the idea that Gandhi and Kallenbach had a homosexual relationship. Following the publication of the unique relationships between Gandhi and Kallenbach in \"Soulmates\", The Government of Lithuania decided to put a statue of the two men in the city of Rusnė in the republic. Lev also wrote \"Vesheyodea Lishol\" (Hebrew for \"And He who Knows how to Ask\", Xargol Publisher, Israel 1998), which is a collection of life stories of people who abandoned the Jewish Orthodox religion, written in a form of monologues."

He was the son of Sheikh Hisam-ud-Din, a soldier who held many high offices in the court of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. He was highly proficient in Persian and Arabic, the two languages which he learned as a child. He also learned Hindi and Sanskrit. Arzu started writing at the age of fourteen, and came to Delhi in 1719. He was introduced to Nawab Qamar-ud-din Khan by Anand Ram 'Mukhlis'. Qamar-ud-Din, who was the prime minister at that time, gave him a suitable job. Arzu used to hold mushairas at his home, and attracted many disciples including Mir Taqi Mir. He migrated to Lucknow in 1754, and subsequently to Ayodhya, which was once the residence of his great grandfather. He died in Lucknow in 1756, and was buried in the Vakilpura area of Delhi."

Slater came to the VFL from Gisborne, in the Riddell District Football League. He started as a forward and kicked four goals on his Essendon debut in the opening round of the 1935 season, against Melbourne at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The feat was overshadowed by teammate Ted Freyer who kicked 12 goals, a then club record. Despite the promising start up forward, Slater spent most of his time at Essendon in defence and as a follower. He won the best and fairest award for the Essendon seconds in 1938. From 1940 to 1945, Slater played for North Melbourne, then in 1946 crossed to Brunswick in the Victorian Football Association. Outside of football, Slater worked for Victoria Police, rising to the rank of Superintendent. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in 1970."

He was one of the leaders of early Ramakrishna Mission in its relief work. One of his significant contributions was providing relief to the citizens of Calcutta during the plague epidemic of 1898–99. He traveled to Japan in 1903. His later days were spent in company of Sister Nivedita as her protector and guide. His notable contribution in the later part of his life was preaching the message of Swami Vivekananda, especially among youth."

It was that Lord Rollo who sold the property of Bannockburn and its lands to Sir Hugh Paterson, father of Sir Hugh Paterson, 1st Baronet. Paterson built much of the current house, and it is little changed since his time.The Patersons were staunch Royalists and James VII gave this Hugh, and later his son (also Hugh), the title of Baronet of Bannockburn. After Hugh Paterson's death on 21 December 1701, his son, the Second Baronet attainted his Baronetcy by being an open and fierce Jacobite, but he lived on at Bannockburn House. In a brief stay at said house, Charles Edward Stuart met the 2nd Baronet's niece, Clementina Walkinshaw, who would eventually be the Young Prince's lover and mother of his daughter."

She took part in beating the principal, Bian Zhongyun, to death in August 1966 with a wooden stick. Bian was the first teacher killed in the Cultural Revolution, and her slaying led to further killings by the Red Guards, and eventually over one million of the Guards gathered in Tiananmen Square, where Binbin famously pinned a red band on Mao Zedong's arm. The scene was captured in a famous photograph. \"After the Cultural Revolution, Ms. Song went to the United States to study and completed a doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She worked for the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection...In 2003, she moved back to China.\" She has since apologized for her actions during the Cultural Revolution."

From June 2012 to December 2013, he was a director for the Fujitsu corporation.

  "text" : "Sandra Lahire (1950–2001) was a central figure in the experimental feminist filmmaking that emerged in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s. Lahire studied Philosophy at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (BA), Fine Art Film at St Martin's School of Art, London, (1984) and Film & Environmental Media at the Royal College of Art, London (MA 1986). It was at St Martin's that she entered the world of independent film, working with artists including Malcolm Le Grice, Lis Rhodes, Tina Keane, and studying alongside the film-maker Isaac Julien. Her poetic short films were made in the context of the London Film-Makers’ Cooperative which “developed a new form of mixed-genre film-making [….] which marked a new stage in experimental film in Britain”, according to Jacqueline Rose. Of this generation Rose has described Lahire as “one of the most gifted, innovative and bold experimental film-makers”. Her first film, ‘’Arrows’’, 1984, was a meditation on anorexia, a subject that threaded throughout her work. In 1986 she made ‘’Terminals’’, ‘’Edge’’, and ‘’Plutonium Blonde’’. In 1987, working with film-makers Jean Matthee and Anna Thew, Lahire made ‘’Uranium Hex’’. ‘’Serpent River’’,1989, explored the toxic effects of a uranium mining corporation, owned by Rio Tinto Zinc, on the residents and inhabitants of Serpent River and Elliott Lake in Ontario, Canada. In 1991 she made ‘’Lady Lazarus’’, the first part of a trilogy ‘’Living on Air’’, which was inspired by the poetry of Sylvia Plath and which she made across the span of nine years. The film incorporated an interview with Plath given just before she died. The lead of ‘’Living on Air’’ was played by fellow film-maker Sarah Turner. ‘’Eerie’’ followed in 1992. The second part of the Plath trilogy, ‘’Night Dances’’, 1995, presented Hebrew inscriptions on worn gravestones and allusions to Yom Kippur through which Lahire explored Jewish aspects of her identity. ‘’Persephone’’ and ‘’Knife Born’’ were made in 1997-98, with the final of the Plath trilogy, ‘’Johnny Panic’’, appearing in 1999. Marina Grzinic has noted Lahire's “profound filmic commentary on anorexia. The body, always that body that is coming near the image of a spectre, that is connected solely with 'air and bones' while minimizing the flesh to zero, is also the primal element she uses to establish her relationship with her surroundings, particularly with a landscape destroyed by pollution or nuclear waste.” Grzinic also underscores the centrality of light and sound in her works, with which “she recreated emotional situations and connections between personal obsession(s) and social structures.” An essay by Lahire, Lesbians in Media Education, appeared in the anthology Visibly Female: Feminism and Art, edited by Hilary Robinson in 1998. She also wrote an essay for Coil Magazine 'The Fairies Banquet', 1999, on Sarah Pucill's film Swollen Stigma (1998) who was her fellow filmmaker and partner at the time. For Make Magazine Issue 7, which was a special issue on the Miniature 1999, she wrote an essay, 'Little Deaths', on her film Johnny Panic (1999) and Sarah Pucill's film Cast (1999). Reflections on Lahire and her work by film-makers Sarah Pucill (who was her partner in the last 6 years of her life), Lis Rhodes (for whom Lahire wrote a score for her film Just About Now ) and Sarah Turner appeared in Vertigo magazine in Spring 2002."

  "text" : "Benno Aleksander (Santeri) Levas (till 1936 Lehmann; 8 February 1899 – 10 March 1987) was a Finnish writer and photographer, best known for his books on the composer Jean Sibelius. Santeri Levas was born in Helsinki, Grand Duchy of Finland, in 1899, to the family of Nicolai Lehmann and Hertta née Piispanen. His main career was in the service of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (1923–1962) as a correspondence clerk and a departmental manager, but he started to publish both fact and fiction, first under pseudonymes, in the mid-1920s. Levas was educated a Master of Arts (1936) and a sworn translator. Levas served as a long-time private secretary to Jean Sibelius, from 1938 till his death in 1957. During their discussions, he was able to jot down unique material for a biography of the master, but it was agreed that the book should only be published after the death of the composer. In 1945, however, Levas published a photographic book on the Sibelius residence, Ainola, in Järvenpää; separate editions were published in both Finnish and Swedish. The second edition, Jean Sibelius and His Home, from 1955 presented the text in four languages. The main work of Levas, the two-volume biography of Sibelius, was first published in Finnish in 1957–1960, and translated into English as an abridged version, Sibelius: A Personal Portrait, in 1972. He also published a biography of Clara and Robert Schumann and several travel books, observing and documenting life in the post-war Germany and Austria, among others. In the 1940s–1950s Levas was a chairman of the Helsinki and later Finnish Photographic Society. He was also an honorary member of Fédération Internationale de l’Art Photographique and an Associate of the Royal Photographic Society (ARPS). His photographs and writings were published in Sweden, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Santeri Levas died at the age of 88 in Helsinki."

  "text" : "Shiblī Yousef Hamad al-Aysamī (Arabic شبلي العيسمي), alternatively also Shibli-L-Aʾysami, al-Ayasami, al-Ayssami or al-ʿAisamī, (5 February 1925-24 May 2011) was a Syrian politician and Arab nationalist figure. He was born to a Druze family in al-Suwayda, Syria. He was kidnapped by unknown persons in Aley, Lebanon and is presumed to be dead. In 1947, together with Michel Aflaq, he became a founding member of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party and from 1963 to 1964 he held different ministerial posts in the Syrian government. In 1964 he was elected as General Secretary of the Syrian Regional Command of the Ba'ath Party and in 1965 he became Vice President of Syria under Amin al-Hafiz. After the 1966 Syrian coup d'état and the Syrian-Iraqi rift he fled to Iraq where in 1974 the Iraqi Branch of the Ba'ath Party installed a rival National Command of the Ba'ath Party with Aflaq as General Secretary and al-Aysami as his deputy (until 1979). In 1982 al-Hafiz and al-Aysami, together with Islamist, nationalist and leftist opposition groups founded the Iraqi-backed National Alliance for the Liberation of Syria, but in 1992 al-Aysami retired from political life. He remained in Iraq until the 2003 invasion of Iraq and fled to Egypt, then the United States and Yemen thereafter. In 2011 during a visit to Lebanon he was kidnapped by unknown militants and is presumed dead. His family accused the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad for the kidnapping. The Syrian government, however, blamed the Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt."

  "text" : "Stig Gunnar Lasseby (March 5, 1925 – December 8, 1996) was a Swedish animator, director and producer. Through his company Team Film he played an important role in the history of Swedish animation. Lasseby was born in Gällivare and was educated as a teacher of drawing. In 1955, with two classmates, he founded the animation studio AB Team Film, which by 1966 made him one of Sweden's best known animators. In 1972 the company produced Agaton Sax och bröderna Max, a television series based on the book of the same name by Nils-Olof Franzén, one of the series about the detective Agaton Sax. In 1976 they produced a series of three short films for television about Agaton Sax, and also Agaton Sax and the Byköpings Village Festival, the first full-length entirely animated Swedish film, co-produced by the Swedish Film Institute. Team Film went on to produce two further full-length animated features, Peter-No-Tail (1981), which was a critical and popular success and was also released in several other countries, and Peter-No-Tail in Americat (1985), which had faster action and for which some of the animation and coloring was outsourced to Prague; it made less money and received a mixed critical reception. Team Film also produced a series for small children, Totte (1973), based on books by Gunilla Wolde, and three shorts based on other children's books, Kattresan (1982), Sjörövarfilmen (1983), and Musikbussen (1994), the first two again sponsored by the Swedish Film Institute. Lasseby also voiced Tänkande August, the computer, in the Agaton Sax films and TV series. Lasseby created an animation school in Eksjö; in 1996 this became the first college-level animation training program in Sweden. He died in 1996 in Hult."

He further his education in police training in Chalon -Sur- Saône and Saint-Cyr-au-Mont d'Or, France. Rasasack was elected as Congressman for the Province of Saravane, Laos. Thereafter, he was elected as Minister to the Two-Party Coalition Assembly. Prior to his life as a Statesman, Rasasack was a Police Commissioner for the Royal Lao Government. He disappeared in 1975 after he was summoned by the President of the Coalition Assembly for a meeting with the Assembly. This was the last contact he had with his family. While he was in prison, Rasasack was in constant fear of losing his life as other political prisoners were being systematically executed. While in prison, Rasasack was physically and psychologically abused by the prison officials. Many political prisoners did not live to tell their stories of abuse and torture. It was learned that Amnesty International negotiated Salath Rasasack's release from the political prison after 16 years. On November 13, 1991 Rasasack was reunited with his family, wife Chansouk Manibod Rasasack (daughter of Phagna Tha Manibod-former Chief Justice for the Kingdom of Laos, former Mayor and Governor of Laos), sons, Salysanh Rasasack, Souksanh Rasasack, Sacksith Rasasack and daughter, Soukhy M. Clark. The majority of the Rasasacks currently reside in Memphis, TN. The day Salath Rasasack arrived at the Memphis International Airport, over 150 people arrived to meet and welcome one of their own to a life of freedom. When he arrived in Memphis, TN, he brought along a prison blanket. When asked by reporters as to the significance of the blanket, Rasasack, stated it had been his blanket for over 16 years."

  "text" : "Seppo Erkki Sakari Heikinheimo (3 June 1938 in Helsinki – 26 May 1997 in Helsinki) was a Finnish musicologist, music journalist, writer and translator. Seppo Heikinheimo’s father was the pianist Sakari Heikinheimo. Seppo begun his piano studies with Erik Tawaststjerna, and after the matriculation examination he studied musicology and classical philology at Helsinki University. He defended his Ph.D. thesis in 1972; the subject was the electronic music of Karlheinz Stockhausen. Heikinheimo started his journalistic career in Uusi Suomi newspaper in 1959, first as a photographer and then as a writer. In 1963, recommended by Tawaststjerna, he moved on to Helsingin Sanomat and worked the rest of his life there as a music journalist. On the top of that, he also worked as an intendant of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1970s. As a critic, Heikinheimo was harsh and sharp. He only knew excellence and inferiority; mediocrity was the worst he could think of. He used W. A. Mozart and Dmitri Shostakovich as yardsticks when evaluating musical accomplishments. In the 1960s Heikinheimo was an advocate of musical modernism and radicalism but later became very suspicious of contemporary music, alienating his former friends. In early 1990s, Heikinheimo was active in starting the Mikkeli Festival. Heikinheimo had a summer villa near Mikkeli in the near the Lake Puula in Hirvensalmi. Heikinheimo’s literary output as a writer, translator and editor was wide. He wrote three voluminous biographies, on Martti Talvela (1978), Aarre Merikanto (1985) and Oskar Merikanto (1995), and translated numerous works of fact and fiction into Finnish, including books by Roald Dahl, Maxim Gorky, Daniel Barenboim, Garri Kasparov, Yuri Lyubimov and others. Of special significance is his translation of the controversial Testimony by Dmitri Shostakovich which he made directly from the Russian-language manuscript. Heikinheimo is known to have used pen names “Antti Virtanen” ja “Raimo Ontronen”. A categorical and highly controversial person, Heikinheimo was proud of his Finnish fatherland and despised the Finland’s Swedish language as the language of the occupiers. He was critical of the Soviet Union but was a friend of many Russian musicians like Vladimir Ashkenazy and Valery Gergiev. For a short period of time, he was the chairman of Association of Finnish Culture and Identity. The last vicissitudes of Heikinheimo’s life were dramatic: he wrote his memoir but seemed to suffer from an ustable state of mind. After having sent the manuscript to his publisher Otava, Heikinheimo committed suicide in an hotel room in Helsinki. A couple of months later the book was published, with the uncompromising title Mätämunan muistelmat (roughly, “Memoirs of a Rotten Egg” or “Memoirs of a Pariah”). It is a book full of vivid and snarky anecdotes from home and abroad, spanning Heikinheimo’s whole career, with 924 names in the personal index. Heikinheimo ends the book in an Biblical words of the Aramaic language, \"Eeli, Eeli lama sabaktani.\" Seppo Heikinheimo was married to the singer (mezzosoprano) Päivi Heikinheimo."

In 2015, NH Governor Margaret Hassan appointed Rep. Smith to be the NH House member of the NH Governor’s Interagency Council on Homelessness. In 2014, Rep. Smith was appointed Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, and previously served on the Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee. In 2014, Rep.

  "text" : "Sam Ballan (1911 – February 1, 1998), known by his pen name Sam Marcy, was an American Marxist of the post-World War II era. He co-founded the Workers World Party in 1959 and served as its chairperson until his death. Marcy was born in Russia to Jewish parents. During the Russian Civil War, his family was a target of anti-Jewish pogroms by the White movement and received protection from the Communist forces. They resettled in Brooklyn, where Marcy became an activist for the Communist Party USA. He studied law at St. Johns University and provided legal advice to labor unions in New York. Marcy grew discontented as a member of the Communist Party, viewing the Third International as increasingly detached from working class interests and instead a mouthpiece for Joseph Stalin, whose oppressive bureaucracy he despised. He joined the Trotskyist movement in the 1940s, building a branch of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in Buffalo. Yet he again became dissatisfied, finding the SWP uncommitted to revolutionary politics and instead oriented toward parliamentary reform. Marcy and other SWP members developed a theory of \"global class war\", according to which Marxists had a duty to defend the existence of the USSR and its satellites in spite of their bureaucracy. Over several years Marcy clashed with the SWP leadership on several questions, including the approach to Communist China and North Korea, whether the SWP should endorse Henry A. Wallace, and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. On the last question, Marcy's faction supported the Soviet military intervention, arguing that the initial worker uprising had attracted class elements that sought to restore capitalism. In 1959 the \"global class war\" faction set up a new organization, the Workers World Party, characterized by outspoken defense of all socialist governments in the world. After the first issue of the Workers World newspaper was published, Marcy started applying his view of Marxism to contemporary issues. Marcy's writings included extensive works on socialism, the Cold War era and the rise of the powerful military-industrial complex. He also wrote about the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, the anti-war movement during the Vietnam War, the economic forces behind capitalist downsizing and the impact of the scientific-technological revolution.  Selections of his works have been translated into many languages, including Persian, Spanish, Turkish, Korean, French and German. His writings show a strong support for Mao Zedong and the Chinese Cultural Revolution, though he continued to defend China against imperialism following the reforms of Deng Xiaoping. Marcy defended China and also the Soviet Union against the charge of imperialism even while disagreeing with some policies and practices of the Communist party leadership of both countries. In addition to his writings, Marcy was one of the organizers of the first demonstration in the United States against the Vietnam War. The demonstration, by WWP affiliate group Youth Against War and Fascism, occurred in August 1962 and was subsequently noted by Ho Chi Minh in an interview with the National Guardian newspaper."

  "text" : "Sir William Duncan Godfrey, 3rd Baronet JP DL (1797–1873) was an Anglo-Irish aristocrat and landowner. Sir William Godfrey was born at Kilcolman Abbey, Milltown on the family estate in County Kerry, Ireland. He was the son of Sir John Godfrey, 2nd Baronet. He was sent to England for his education, attending Westminster School. He subsequently studied at an academy in Geneva, before embarking on the Grand Tour. Despite his cosmopolitan upbringing, Godfrey returned to Ireland following his travels in Europe, and remained in County Kerry for most of his life. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1822 and became a captain of the Milltown Infantry contingent in 1824. He was sworn in as High Sheriff of Kerry in 1829. At the insistence of his friend, Valentine Browne, 2nd Earl of Kenmare, Godfrey was made a Deputy Lieutenant for Kerry in 1832. Throughout the 1830s, Sir William Godfrey managed the estates of both his brother-in-law, John Coltsmann of Flesk Castle and that of his cousin, Arthur Blennerhassett of Ballyseedy. He was an avid farmer, and unlike many Anglo-Irish landowners, he took a keen interest in his estate and tenants. He was recognised by the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland for his promotion and use of advanced farming techniques. Politically, Godfrey aligned himself with the liberal wing of the Conservative Party, although he never stood for elected office. He was known to be sympathetic towards Catholic emancipation. During the Irish famine of the 1840s, Godfrey organised and chaired several local relief committees. In May 1846, Sir William purchased alarge quantity of Indian meal to bridge the period before the first potato crops became available. He lobbied the government in London on numerous occasions, warning in October 1846 that, \"the people have endured their wants & privations with resignation and patience but if employment and relief are delayed much longer, the peace & tranquillity of this district must be seriously endangered.\" Godfrey was a stalwart and committed supporter of the established Anglican Church of Ireland although his wife, Mary Teresa, was a devout Roman Catholic. The couple had ten children and in a family compromise, the boys were raised as Anglicans and the girls as Roman Catholics. He was succeeded in his title by his eldest son, John Fermor Godfrey."

Ruhle is known as the first journalist to break the 2012 story of the London Whale, identifying the trader behind the 2012 JPMorgan Chase trading loss. In 2015, she interviewed presidential candidate Donald Trump, who faced backlash in the media after noting to Ruhle that “the World Trade Center came down during [former President George W. Bush’s] reign.” The previous year, rapper Kanye West strongly criticized photographer Annie Leibovitz during a panel conversation with Ruhle when he revealed that Leibovitz pulled out of taking his official wedding pictures just one day before his wedding to Kim Kardashian. Ruhle’s interview with Martha Stewart in 2013 brought an ongoing feud between Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow public after Stewart questioned the actress’s place in the \"lifestyle business.\""

  "text" : "Sarah Prince Gill (1728-1761) was an American Christian prayer group leader and writer. The daughter of Thomas and Deborah Prince, Sarah was born in 1728. Her father, Thomas Prince, was the pastor of Boston's Old South Meeting House during the Great Awakening. She never published during her lifetime, but her Meditations were saved in the Boston Public Library and published recently in a volume with meditations of Sarah Edwards, edited by Dorothy Baker. She was also a correspondent of Esther Edwards Burr whose journal was published in 1984 edited by Laurie Crumpacker and Carol Karlsen. The two women started prayer groups and met regularly to monitor their own religious experience. Prince and Burr kept their rich, lengthy exchange of letters hidden from their families. They were best friends and called each other \"sisters of the heart.\" Prince deeply mourned Burr's death in 1758; as she wrote in her diary, \"My whole prospects in this world are now changed. . . O the tenderness which tied our hearts! O the comfort I have enjoyed in her.\" Their close relationship stands out in an era when male commenters doubted women had the capacity for true friendship. Their prayer groups may have been models for the women's groups of the nineteenth century. Prince married Moses Gill in 1758 and they inherited the Prince estate in Princeton, Massachusetts. They had no children. Prince died in 1761."

In 986, after the death of the Bavandid ruler Rustam II, his son al-Marzuban ascended the Bavandid throne. There have been several confusions about the reign of the Bavandid kings after the death of Rustam II. In 986, al-Marzuban is no longer mentioned as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty, and a certain Sharwin III is instead mentioned as the ruler of the dynasty. Shahriyar III is later mentioned as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty in the following year. Al-Marzuban is then once again mentioned in sources, as having deposed Shahriyar III, and restored himself as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty. In 998, Shahriyar III returned to Tabaristan with Ziyarid aid, and captured Shahriyarkuh from al-Marzuban. However, al-Marzuban, with Buyid aid, managed to quickly repel him from the city. Shahriyar III shortly made another counter-attack, and defeated al-Marzuban. Shahriyar III then ascended the Bavandid throne, and declared independence from Ziyarid rule. al-Marzuban used this opportunity to become the vassal of the Ziyarids, and regain his throne. Shahriyar III then fled to Ray, where he died in 1000."

Born in Camerino, Sebastiani trained in the workshop of Girolamo Lombardo in Recanati, and collaborated with several smelters. The workshop often huddled pacts to cope with the commission volumes, so that often the works of these sculptors are teamwork and can hardly be attributed to only one of them. He oversaw the process of bronze casting for the monument to Pope Paul V. He contributed to the main door right side of the Basilica della Santa Casa along with Tiburzio Vergelli. He died in 1626 in Recanati."

  "text" : "Sofia Cocea, also known under her married name as Sofia Chrisoscoleu or Sofia Hrisoscoleu (1839–1861), was a Moldavian, later Romanian essayist, journalist and poet. Born in Fălticeni, she was from a modest family of estate managers. At age thirteen in 1852, she translated a novel by Madame de Genlis from French into Romanian, under the title Palmira și Flaminia sau secretul (\"Palmira and Flaminia or the Secret\"), as well as the play Maria sau mustrările de cuget ale unei mame (\"Maria or a Mother's Qualms of Conscience\"). Gheorghe Asachi, then working a censor, considered the latter immoral and tried unsuccessfully to have it banned. When she was seventeen, she applied for a grant to study abroad but was denied. She studied at Iași and at Târgu Neamț, becoming a schoolteacher in the latter town and in Vaslui in 1857, later founding a private boarding school in Fălticeni. In 1859, she married Professor V. Chrisoscoleu. She aligned herself with the writers and journalists who, after the 1848 revolution, advocated the unification of the Danubian Principalities. Linguist Sanda Golopenția describes her essays as \"lively, firm, courageous and slightly ironic\"; these appeared in the leading pro-union journals of the time, including Tribuna românǎ, Reforma, Gazeta poporului, Zimbrul, Foiletonul Zimbrului, Românul and Dacia, as well as in Steaua Dunării and Gazeta de Moldavia. Among the topics she covered were the peasantry's economic and social status, women's rights, culture and public education and foreign policy. Golopenția considers that her occasional poems are \"by far superseded\" by her journalism and essays. She died in Vaslui."

  "text" : "Simone Osborne is a Canadian lyric and operatic soprano. She was one of the youngest-ever winners of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions in 2008 at age 21. Osborne was born in British Columbia. She studied opera performance at the University of British Columbia and later joined the Canadian Opera Company's Studio Ensemble program. Prior to joining the COC, she busked on the streets of Toronto in order to be able to afford singing lessons. She is \"considered one of Canada's most sought-after sopranos\". She sings with the Canadian Opera Company and has also appeared with ensembles from around the world, including the New York City Opera, the Vancouver Symphony, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Her operatic roles have included Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro, Gilda in Rigoletto, and Pamina in Die Zauberflöte. One of her performances of Pamina, with the Vancouver Opera, required her to learn an English and Musqueam adaptation. She also participated in the Viva Verdi! gala in Zurich in celebration of Giuseppe Verdi's bicentennial. Osborne has received significant critical recognition. F. Paul Driscol of Opera News called her a \"lyric soprano with outstanding ability and impressive charm\". Marilyn Horne, who Osborne cites as a mentor, said Osborne is \"half athlete and half artist...She understands that voices need to be brilliant, dark and bright, all at once\". Osborne was the first winner of the Jeunesses Musicales Canada's Maureen Forrester Award Tour, which comprises two seasons of recitals across Canada and a commission from the Canadian Art Song Project. Osborne has also won the Marilyn Horne Foundation Competition and the International Czech and Slovak Opera Competition."

  "text" : "Suzy King (born Georgina Pires Sampaio, August 28, 1917 – August, 1985) was a Brazilian dancer, singer, actress and fakir. Georgina Pires Sampaio started her very public life in 1939, in São Paulo, Brazil, as Diva Rios, singing sambas and marches. Later on, following the trail opened by shock-star Luz del Fuego (Fire’s Light) she changed her name to Suzy King and started her peculiar act of singing-and-dancing while holding big pythons around herself. Georgina had her peak during the 1950s when public fakirism was a craze in the country. She was a multi-media star of sorts when such a term did not exist yet, always making sure newspapers would keep abreast of what she was doing. She kept her pythons in her own flat in Copacabana having had the neighbours on edge when a python escaped from its cage falling down to its death on the pavement. It was front page news. Georgina wrote a play that was banned by the authorities. She also tried to emulate Lady Godiva wearing a long blond wig to cover her breasts and riding a horse through the centre of the city. She was almost gang-raped by a mob and was helped by a good soul that passed by. Georgina left for the USA in the late 1960s, where she changed her name to Yacui Yapura Sampaio Bailey. At the same time she decided to lope 17 years off her official age. Georgina died in 1985, in California."

  "text" : "Samuel Green was born in Meredith, New Hampshire in 1796. At an early age, his parents believed him to be possessed by a demon because of his frequent school skipping and would whip him. As a teenager, he became a blacksmith's apprentice where he was whipped for stealing. He was whipped for destroying the blacksmith's garden but did not admit it. He was then sent home and whipped again. In retaliation, Green threw the family dog down a well, contaminating the water, and causing great expense to the family. He was beaten severely for this. He retaliated by slashing the neck of the family pig and was again whipped. The family gave up and sent Samuel to live with family friend Albert Dunne in New Hampton, New Hampshire. Green attended school for a while but began skipping again. He then stole a Jew's harp from a shop and Dunne beat him as punishment. Green fled home and his parents, having heard of the theft beat him unconscious. Green was sent to Dunne and then whipped until flesh was flayed off his back. For the last beating, Green set up a trap to kill Dunne. He put an axe, that would fall on his head, and a pitchfork, that would strike him, in the barn door. When Dunne entered the barn, the axe sliced his coat and the pitchfork gave him a slight foot injury. Dunne then tied Green against a barn door, severely whipping and bloodying him for the attempted murder. Afterwards, Green destroyed a hogshed of cider, stole bushels of corn, and tried to burn down Dunne's barn. As usual, he was whipped and beat by Dunne. After a few months, Green became too strong for Dunne, who let him be. Later, Green met another youth named William Ash."

James Dickey praised her work calling comparing it to the work of Stephen Crane, Robert Graves and Freya Stark.

  "text" : "Sahndra Fon Dufe (born 28 October 1989) is a Cameroon-born actress, author, screenwriter, film producer, and CEO of the Indie production house African Pictures International. She has appeared in several international movies including One Night in Vegas, and 'Black November'. Cameroonian singer Said Barah has referred to her as \"Young Oprah\" in one of his songs called Sahndra Fon Dufe, in admiration for her creative ingenuity and inspirational influence for young women all over Africa. Fon Dufe's first film roles were in local Cameroonian films like Standing the Rain (2009) and Two Princes (2010). She subsequently appeared in the NollyWood independent film Lost in Abroad (2012) and performed with Wyclef Jean, Akon, and Hakeem Kae-Kazim in Black November (2012) At age 23, Fon Dufe's performance in the award-winning romantic comedy One Night in Vegas (2013) directed by John Ikem Uche and starring Jimmy Jean Louis, Sarodj Bertin, and Michael Blackson earned her a lot of attention for her portrayal of Van Vicker's wife, Mildred, a cancer patient trying to secure guardianship for her children before her death. Other film roles include Yurika in Frank Rajah's Refugees (2013) starring Yvonne Nelson, Kwuni in Unconditional Love (2013) with John Dumelo, and Patience in the short film The Successor of Katunga.(2013). In addition to acting, Fon Dufe is also known for being the brainchild behind the Yefon trilogy. The trilogy, set in 1940 West Africa, portrays a young African village girl who goes against the discriminatory laws of her tribe, which subjugate women, and becomes the spark for a literary revolution. The debut novel Yefon: The Red Necklace (2014) is set to travel to the silver screen in the future, and Sahndra herself will step into the lead role. Other cast members include: Isaiah Washington, Adriana Barazza, Jimmy Jean Louis, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, Leleti Khumalo, Uti Nwachukwu and many others with a soundtrack by Kelly Price. In 2012, she partnered with the United States Embassy in Yaoundé, Cameroon, to organise training for young actors through a jointly owned International Workshop called Know Your Craft International. Sahndra also actively supports young female entertainers through an annual scholarship program in Lourdes College, Cameroon. She is also a voice for Project New Bamenda, a project launched to support young Cameroonian entrepreneurs from the North West Region of Cameroon."

  "text" : "Samuel Emmett Horne, Jr. (1924–2006) was a research scientist at B. F. Goodrich noted for first synthesizing cis-1,4-polyisoprene, the main polymer contained in natural tree rubber, using Ziegler catalysis. Earlier attempts to produce synthetic rubber from isoprene had been unsuccessful, but in 1955, Horne prepared 98 percent cis-1,4-polyisoprene via the stereospecific polymerization of isoprene. The product of this reaction differs from natural rubber only slightly. It contains a small amount of cis-1,2-polyisoprene, but it is indistinguishable from natural rubber in its physical properties. The importance of Horne's development of synthetic polyisoprene and polybutadiene is readily seen in the production of these polymers. In 2008, global production of polybutadiene was 2,042,000 metric tons (exceeded only by SBR in capacity and production). Production of polyisoprene was 611,000 metric tons (Russia, 415,000; Asia, 78,000; US, 90,000; Europe, 25,000). In 1980, the ACS Rubber Division honored Horne with the Charles Goodyear Medal. In 1982, he received an honorary doctorate from Emory University."

  "text" : "Stefan Balšić (Serbian Cyrillic: Стефан Балшић; fl. 1419-40), known as Stefan Maramonte, was a Zetan nobleman. He was the son of Konstantin Balšić and Helena Thopia. After Konstantin's death (1402), Helena entered the Republic of Venice and then lived with her sister Maria. Since Maria was married to Phillip Maramonte, the Venetians and Ragusans often referred to Stefan Balšić with the name Maramonte. He was initially a close associate to Zetan lord Balša III (r. 1403-1421), being his vassal. Balša III and Stefan fought against the Republic of Venice, and Stefan helped in the administration of the land as co-ruler with Balša III, he did however not succeed Balša III. Balša III, who died on 28 April 1421, had decided to pass the rule of Zeta to his uncle, the Serbian Despot Stefan Lazarević. When the Second Scutari War between Venice and Despot Stefan began, he [...]. Stefan left Apulia in the summer of 1426, seeking to take Zeta. During the 1427–28 conflict, Maramonte went to the Ottoman court where he sought the support of Sultan Murad II for his appointment as the Lord of Zeta. There, he met Skanderbeg, who was a hostage at the Ottoman court. Maramonte married Vlajka Kastrioti, the sister of Skanderbeg. Supported by the Ottomans, Maramonte, accompanied by Gojčin Crnojević and Little Tanush, plundered the region around Scutari and Ulcinj, and attacked Drivast in 1429, but failed to capture it. Since his attempts failed, Maramonte surrendered to the Venetians and served as their military officer in the campaigns in Flanders and Lombardia."

Susan Jarratt's book Rereading the Sophists: Classical Rhetoric Refigured contains several good ideas about history and historiography, and it offers an interesting and inspiring writing pedagogy.

At the 1958 European Championships, held in his home city of Stockholm, Pettersson won the bronze medal with a jump of 2.10 m. At the 1962 Championships in Belgrade he cleared 2.13 m, enough for a silver medal behind the future Olympic Champion Valeriy Brumel. Pettersson was the national champion in 1956–62 and 1964 and held the Swedish high jump record from 1960 to 1968; his personal best of 2.16 m was among the world's best jumps in 1962. Track & Field News ranked him in the world's top 10 from 1956 to 1964. In the 1970s Pettersson was director of the Swedish Athletics Association. He headed the national athletics team at the 1980 Olympics and carried the Swedish Olympic flag at the opening ceremony."

  "text" : "Sibella Annie Barrington (4 December 1867 – 9 December 1929) was a Canadian nurse. Born to a family of British settlers in Cape Breton in 1867, Barrington studied at the Aberdeen Hospital School of Nursing in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. She graduated in 1904 and became a registered nurse in 1922, when the province introduced registration. Barrington continued her studies internationally, first in Chicago, and then in Dublin where she learned of Lady Aberdeen's work in combatting tuberculosis. In London, she worked with the New Zealand physician and child welfare advocate, Frederic Truby King. She returned to Nova Scotia and by 1917 had a thriving private practice. The British Red Cross Society granted her a lifetime membership for her volunteer work following the 1917 Halifax Explosion. From 1918 to 1923 she served as superintendent of the Halifax Infants’ Home. She served as vice-president of the Children's Aid Society, president of the Graduate Nurses’ Association of Nova Scotia, a councillor for Nova Scotia on the Canadian Nurses’ Association, and a delegate to the National Council of Women of Canada. Following the First World War, the Canadian Red Cross Society sought an increased peacetime role. Barrington moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where she worked as an organizer of home nursing for the society. Mandated to teach women basic home nursing skills and disease recognition, Barrington made hundreds of home visits and public addresses, and organized dozens of classes. She was also instrumental in establishing Red Cross hospitals in St. Leonard and Clair. Barrington died in 1929 after surgery at the Saint John General Public Hospital."

  "text" : "Steve 'Spaz' Williams (born 1962) is a Canadian special effects artist and animator. Williams studied animation at Sheridan College, graduating in 1984. During the summers he would work at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education Computer Laboratory, learning more about computer animation. After graduation, he went on to work at Alias Research (currently a part of Autodesk) in Toronto. He acted as the company's spokesperson, leading to a job at Industrial Light & Magic in 1988. ILM had purchased Silicon Graphics computers to create the computer-generated effects in The Abyss, and said workstations used Alias modeling software. Along with animators Mark A.Z. Dippé, Scott E. Anderson and Jay Riddle, Williams helped develop a photorealistic alien pseudopod made out of seawater, which later earned the film an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. Continuing at ILM, Williams worked in two more breakthrough moments of CG effects that earned the company more Oscars: the T-1000 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), a liquid metal robot that evolved from the work done in The Abyss; and the Tyrannosaurus in Jurassic Park (1993). As the chief computer graphics animator of The Mask, Williams shared a nomination for Best Visual Effects (along with Tom Bertino, Jon Farhat and Scott Squires) at the 67th Academy Awards. Williams left ILM along with Dippé following their work in Spawn (1997), which Dippé directed with Williams being the effects supervisor and second unit director. Along with a job at New Line Productions, Williams opened Hoytyboy Productions in San Francisco. Hoytyboy's biggest work was 2006's The Wild for Walt Disney Pictures, which Williams directed. He also directed more than 200 commercials for 1997 and 2010, for clients including Capital One, Toyota, AT&T, Lexus and McDonald's. As of 2012, Williams continues directing commercials, and teaches a class on Directing for Film and Animation at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco."

  "text" : "Samuel Bolton Colburn (1909 Denver, Colorado - 1993, Pacific Grove, California) was an experimental artist, evolving a modernist approach to landscape and genre scenes during the Depression era. In the 1930s California became known nationally for its Regionalist painters like Colburn, who depicted urban and rural views of native life. These artists’ preferred medium was watercolor and they worked quickly outdoors on location developing a painting style that was spontaneous, gestural and raw. While most American Regionalists worked in a realistic manner, Colburn liked to experiment with the lessons of modernism. Like the East Coast modernist John Marin, who was a major influence on the artist, Colburn continually searched for a direct freedom of expression. The San Francisco critic Alfred Frankenstein credited Colburn with a sense of drama and “as fine an eye for the subtleties of watercolor as this country has produced since Marin’s heyday.” Colburn grew up in Glendale and Long Beach and studied geology at the University of Southern California. After graduating in 1932 he spent a year in Europe traveling and studying art. Upon his return to Los Angeles, he studied with Don Graham at Chouinard Art Institute. In 1937 he moved to Carmel, where he became a member of the Carmel Art Association three years later The Monterey Peninsula provided the perfect cultural climate for the development of Colburn’s art. At the time, the prominent artists Armin Hansen, William Ritschel, Paul Whitman, August Gay, and Louis Siegriest were present in the area and provided valuable friendship and advice; the writer John Steinbeck, poet Robinson Jeffers and photographers Edward Weston and Ansel Adams were also close friends. Salvador Dalí, who lived in Pebble Beach during the 1940s, attracted other important European modernists to the area including Fernand Leger, with whom Colburn studied in 1941. Colburn's portrait of Jeffers is on the cover of the 1963 Vintage paperback edition of Robinson Jeffers: Selected Poems. For many years, Colburn lived in Carmel, in a large house which was a center for local bohemian activity, playing his violin during late night drinking parties and living mainly off an inheritance, which eventually gave out. Later he lived in a sheltered cabin called Stag’s Retreat in the beachside Asilomar woods, across from the last remaining sand dunes in the area. Something of a local legend on the Peninsula for his acerbic wit and eccentric character, Colburn was an active member of the artistic community, teaching, writing art criticism for The Carmel Pine Cone, executing public murals, and exhibiting in galleries and museums throughout California, Colorado, and New York. Colburn gained his substantial reputation as a watercolorist and for his early paintings of the Monterey Peninsula in Northern California. He depicted the fisherman and activities around the wharf and in the canneries, and the hills and farm buildings around Salinas and Carmel Valley. In Colburn’s early landscapes, he is interested in structure and composition, trying to capture the essence of a scene with a Cezannesque interest in reducing volumes to shape and color. His early figural works of Monterey fisherman at work in the sardine canneries made famous by John Steinbeck, reduce the figures to blocky forms in the manner of Diego Rivera. Colburn’s later nudes, still lifes, and landscapes, made when the artist was in his eighties, are elegant, and entirely loose and expressive. The artist developed a vision of his own through the years, directly transferring his feeling for nature and the moment to the viewer."

  "text" : "Sanford Morton \"Sandy\" Grossman (June 12, 1935 – April 2, 2014) was an American sports television director. He directed television broadcasts of 10 Super Bowls, 18 NBA Finals, 5 Stanley Cup finals and Olympic hockey matches. He won eight Emmy Awards for his directing. He was born on June 12, 1935, in Newark, New Jersey. After graduating from Weequahic High School, he studied broadcasting at the University of Alabama, where he called football games for the school radio station. He graduated in 1957 and wanted to pursue a career in the communication industry, but believed he did not have the right voice to be a broadcaster. Grossman worked as an usher for the Ed Sullivan Theater for several years before obtaining employment at the local CBS station, Channel 2. In 1963, he became a production assistant for CBS Sports. He was the chief director of broadcasting NBA games during the early 1970s and soon became the main N.F.L. director. Grossmann innovated using music at the break of basketball games, and after he played The Hustle by Van McCoy, McCoy sent him a gold record in thanks of his promotion. Grossman began working alongside John Madden and Pat Summerall on CBS in 1981, and their partnership lasted 21 seasons. Madden insisted that Grossman and producer Bob Stenner watch coaches’ films of the NFL teams, which helped Grossman choose the best shots to pair with Madden's commentary. Madden credits him for being the first director to widen the camera shot to incorporate footage of outside linebackers. He created these broadcasts out of a production truck crammed with television monitors that formed a screen shot. During a Giants-Bengals game in 1991, Stenner and Grossman made 1,100 decisions about camera angles and the like. Summerall and Madden decided to move to Fox Sports after that network acquired broadcasting rights to NFL games in 1994, and Grossman followed suit. He retired in 2012. That year, the Elite Football League of India hired Grossman to teach its camera crews how to cover the American sport. “There were some guys who couldn’t follow the players,” he said. “I said, ‘Get the kicker,’ and some of them didn’t know where to find him.”. Grossman died on April 2, 2014 in Boca Raton, Florida. The stated cause of death was cancer. He was survived by his wife, Faithe; sons Bobby and Dean; daughters, Jodi Grossman Rose and Bari Grossman Rosenholtz; and eight grandchildren; Alexa, Jordyn, Kaylie, Paige, Adam, Reese, Eliya, and Zachary. John Madden said about Grossman: “Sandy became like a defensive coordinator, the way he looked at stuff. If they go slot, if they bunch their receivers on one side and they break off — he had a plan for everything, and when it happens, boom, boom, boom, you’re right there. Sandy took the knowledge he got from the film and transferred it to the cameramen, who carried it over to the game.”"

  "text" : "Sam Aaronovitch (26 December 1919 – 30 May 1998) was a British economist, academic, working class intellectual and senior member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. He was born in the East End of London to Jewish immigrants and his early years were devoted to activity as a Communist Party militant and then a party full timer. In 1945 he was the election agent for one of only two Communist candidates ever elected to the London County Council. Near the age of 50, he entered academia as an economist after studying at Balliol College, Oxford from 1967 to 1971. He once explained his difficulties in filling in applications for university posts: \"Education: St George's-in-the-East Secondary, Stepney 1930–34; Balliol College, Oxford 1967–71.\" He became head of the economics department at South Bank Polytechnic and published a stream of books and articles on topics such as industrial pricing, insurance, monopoly, the impact of the City on the London economy, macroeconomic policy. Although he remained a Communist Party member and a devoted Marxist, he was a critic of party orthodoxy. Working with a team of militant trade union officials and young intellectuals, Aaronovitch helped develop the Alternative Economic Strategy for the Labour movement only to see it derailed by the 1979 election victory of Margaret Thatcher. He published a series of books on British political economy helping popularize the subject and as a speaker was able to combine and integrate industrial and academic viewpoints. Aaronovitch aligned himself with the modernizing Eurocommunist movement in the 1980s and was a frequent contributor to Marxism Today. In 1981, he published The Road from Thatcherism in an attempt to articulate the need for a broad alliance against Thatcherism. In 1982, he established and ran the Local Economic Policy Unit and published the journal Local Economy. The Sam Aaronovitch Memorial Prize is awarded each year. Falling ill, he retired from South Bank University in 1997. He was married three times, to Bertha, Kirstine, and Lavender. He was survived by five children, among them the science fiction scriptwriter Ben Aaronovitch, journalist David Aaronovitch and actor Owen Aaronovitch. A family memoir by David Aaronovitch, Party Animals: My Family and Other Communists, was published in January 2016."

  "text" : "Samuel Wheelhouse  is a young British inventor and engineer. His work includes the AutoDock and Man Overboard! systems. Autodock was designed in 2010. It was designed to aid the docking of large ships and yachts using a combination of thrusters and sensors. The following year Wheelhouse also developed Man Overboard. The device can be used to detect crew members falling overboard ships in heavy seas. The project uses multiple technologies that are not available with current solutions. Both projects were developed during his final two years at Nottingham High School. Wheelhouse has been recognized for his work by a number of regional, national and international awards. He is also an Arkwright scholar and was sponsored by the Lloyd's Register who were responsible for funding his projects. The Autodock system placed him in the top 5 in the National Science and Engineering Competition 2012. The following year his Man Overboard! project was awarded East Midlands Regional Winner of the National Science and Engineering Competition 2012. He then proceeded to win the WCSIM Young Engineer of The Year 2013 at the Big Bang Fair in London. He was later invited to represent the United Kingdom at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Phoenix, AZ USA. His Man Overboard! project was awarded 3rd in the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering category of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Samuel has now been made an apprentice to the Worshipful Company of Scientific Instrument Makers (who sponsored him through the Intel ISEF). He is also currently trying to commercialise his projects. He now studies Mechanical Engineering at Loughborough University and is expected to graduate in 2016. On 28 October Samuel Wheelhouse co-founded Skyrocket Solutions Ltd. Skyrocket Solutions aim to improve efficiency and profits through the use of technology."
