  "text" : "Thomas Challis (1 July 1794 – 20 August 1874) was a British businessman and Liberal Party politician who held office as a Member of Parliament and as Lord Mayor of London. Born in the City of London, he was a hide merchant with business premises in the Bermondsey area of south London, and also was a skin broker in Finsbury. Challis was elected an alderman for Cripplegate Ward in 1844, an office he held until his death, when he was the senior member of the court of aldermen of the City of London. In 1846-47 he held the office of Sheriff of London and Middlesex and was Lord Mayor of London in 1856-57. A member of the Worshipful Company of Butchers, he was master of the company in 1839. In June 1852 a general election was called and a group of 500 electors in the Clerkenwell area presented a petition to Challis requesting that he stand for election to parliament for the constituency of Finsbury. He consented to become a candidate, declaring that if elected he would \"exercise his own judgement, and, opposing all class legislation, he should make truth the basis of his conduct, and the happiness of the people his object.\" There were three candidates for the two-seat constituency, and Challis was elected along with his fellow Liberal, Thomas Slingsby Duncombe. He served a single term, standing down at the next general election in 1857. On Michaelmas Day 1852 Challis was elected by the Corporation of London as Lord Mayor of London. He took office on 9 November, although the traditional Lord Mayor's Show was not held as the City was preparing to hold the state funeral of the Duke of Wellington. He died at his country home in Enfield, Middlesex, and was buried at Enfield Chase Cemetery."

  "text" : "Theophilus Lewis (1891–1974) was an African-American drama critic, a writer, and a magazine editor during the Harlem Renaissance whose contributions primarily appeared in The Messenger, the socialist African-American magazine founded by A. Philip Randolph and Chandler Owen. Lewis was well known for his staunch support of the advancement of a black aesthetic in the arts, particularly the advancement of plays that represented African-Americans well. Born in Baltimore, Lewis idolized H. L. Mencken, the legendary newspaper writer, magazine editor, and literary critic who contributed to The Smart Set, a magazine that Lewis read religiously. After returning from fighting in World War I, Lewis settled in New York with his family and began working for the Postal Service, a job Lewis held for 33 years and by which supported his wife and three children. There he met Randolph and Owen and showed them one of his reviews of the local theater, and these men loved Lewis caustic take on the oft-demeaning roles that white playwrights gave African-American actors. Randolph offered to buy Lewis’s theater tickets if Lewis would contribute reviews of theatrical productions to The Messenger; this is the only compensation Lewis received for his work. Lewis had a deep-seated belief that “theater was an essential vehicle through which society could effect and consider social change and cultural development,” and he was especially derisive of the vulgarity and banality that dominated portrayals of African-Americans. The theater productions that included African-Americans almost always cast individuals who were quite fair-skinned, and many of the plays and musicals included nudity and crass humor. He also pushed for more demanding and positive roles for the black actors, which he thought would cultivate a truly black aesthetic that would solidify a “black” cultural identity, as opposed to mimicking the manners, conventions, and customs of white theater productions. According to Theodore Kornweibel, “His fundamental theme, that the primary need of blacks in establishing their own cultural independence was for a national black theater grounded in the works of black playwrights, was a justifiable criticism.” In the July 1926 issue of The Messenger, Lewis condemned the duplicity of upper-class African-Americans, saying “But when the higher type of Negro goes into the theater, he commonly ignores his own tastes [. . .] and demands that the performance be adjusted to a set of standards alien to birth.\" During his time at The Messenger, Lewis worked closely with George S. Schuyler, co-authoring a column entitled \"Shafts and Darts: A Page of Calumny and Satire.” He also was instrumental in fostering the career of Wallace Thurman, whom Lewis had hired in 1925 to contribute articles and run errands for Lewis's own start-up magazine The Looking Glass. After that magazine folded after a few issues, Lewis convinced Randolph to hire Thurman as an associate editor and writer for The Messenger. After Randolph and Owen left the editorship of The Messenger to devote their time to unionizing, Schuyler and Lewis took over and shifted the magazine's focus away from socialism toward literature, drama, and the arts of the Harlem Renaissance. Lewis emphasized art that demonstrated \"sincerity [which], however crudely expressed, is at the root of every true art,” which ran counter to Randolph's socialistic ideals. After leaving The Messenger after it folded, Lewis continued to write regularly for publications such as Opportunity, Inter-State Tatler, and Amsterdam News. Lewis converted to Catholicism later in life, and after that point his writing appeared in Catholic World, Commonweal, and America. Lewis died in 1974."

Askham appeared in five first-class matches as a right arm fast medium bowler who was a righthanded batsman. He took two wickets with a best performance of two for 68 and scored 83 runs with a highest score of 28 not out. Askham joined the Suffolk Regiment in October 1915 instead of taking up a scholarship at Cambridge University. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 9th Battalion, and was sent to the Western Front in 1916 where he was involved in the Battle of the Somme. On 21 August, he was in action near Mailly-Maillet in the Albert sector and was killed while leading his men in a frontal attack on the German lines."

  "text" : "Thomas Almond Ayres (1816-1858) was a California gold rush-era artist, most famous for drawing the first rendering of Yosemite Valley to be published and popularized. Ayres was born in Woodbridge, New Jersey in 1816. As a young adult, he moved to Wisconsin Territory and worked as a draftsman in what was to become St. Paul, Minnesota (then still part of Wisconsin Territory). In 1849, he went to California, embarking from New York on the steamship Panama on February 4. As the announcement of gold was only made by President Polk the previous December, this made Ayres among the first to head to the gold fields. He arrived in August, and immediately set out to the diggings. Like many fortune seekers, he was unlucky; however, he spent his time constructively, sketching many gold rush and other California scenes, eventually earning a reputation as a landscape artist. In 1855, the publisher and promoter James Hutchings contrived the idea of publishing a magazine to popularize California, which he was to call Hutchings Illustrated California Magazine. Hutchings' motivations were to attract immigrants, as well as to make money on his publications. He invited Ayres to accompany him into the Yosemite, and in June 1855 as the party followed the traditional Indian trail into the valley they stopped at what became known as Inspiration Point so that Ayres could sketch the view, the first such drawing of the valley to be published. For the next five days, Ayres sketched many of the now famous and iconic views of the valley, one per day. Hutchings report of the trip was published in Volume 1 Number 1, and Ayres himself wrote a separate account in the Daily Alta California. In addition to publishing in the magazine, Ayres converted his sketches into a popular panorama displayed at McNulty's Hall in Sacramento. In 1856, Ayres returned to Yosemite Valley and recorded several more sketches. These he took back east himself and exhibited them at the American Art Union in New York. As a result, Harper & Brothers commissioned him to return to California to gather images for them to publish. In the winter of 1857-1858, after stopping over in San Francsico, Ayres traveled around southern California gathering material. On April 26, 1858, as he was headed back to San Francisco, the passenger ship he was in sunk in a storm off Point Dume. Everyone on the ship perished, and all of the sketches Ayres had brought with him were lost. The quality of his work as art is not generally considered high, but since his work is historically important and the originals are rare, these works are considered to be very significant."

  "text" : "Thomas Henderson Whitehead (August 1851 – 8 May 1933) was a Scottish banker in Hong Kong and member of the Executive Council and Legislative Council of Hong Kong. Born at Dunblane, Scotland in August 1851, he initially planned his career as a lawyer and received legal and commercial training in Dunblane and Liverpool. He later on joined the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China and became Manager of the Hong Kong branch in 1883 and Superintendent of its Far Eastern Branches in 1893. Whitehead represented the bank to the United States Government on the issue of maintaining the stability of Mexican dollars. He left Hong Kong in 1902 to take the bank's joint-manager in London. He was appointed unofficial member of the Legislative Council in 1890 and Executive Council in 1902. Whitehead held criticism to the incompetence of the Tung Wah Hospital during the Plague of 1894 in the Legislative Council. Whitehead also suggested a recreation ground to be built in Causeway Bay in the 60th year of the reign of Queen Victoria. In 1896, Whitehead sent a petition to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, asking for a more representative government in Hong Kong. In 1902 Whitehead again represented the Hong Kong ratepayers to send a petition to the Parliament in London for constitutional reform of the Hong Kong municipal government. Whitehead involved in the negotiations with the Chinese authorities in Peking and Canton over the Cassel loan of 1895 whereby Britain loaned the Chinese government a million pounds to help them pay the indemnity they owed to Japan after losing the First Sino-Japanese War. In 1900, the Qing Imperial Court appointed him as the Financial Adviser. In 1917 Whitehead was closely identified with the creation of the British Overseas Banks' Association (the organization later became the British Overseas and Commonwealth Banks Association in 1964), of which he became the first chairman. He was a prominent figure of the banking system until he retired in 1920. Whitehead was also a correspondent for The Times in Hong Kong and came into prominence in 1895 when he disclosed the secret treaty between China and Russia regarding the occupation of Port Arthur. Whitehead died in a London nursing house on 8 May 1933 at the age of 81. The cremation took place at Golders Green and interment at Dunblane."

He entered at the Middle Temple in April 1842, and studied law in the chambers of Thomas Chitty, being called to the bar in November 1845. He practised in the Courts at Westminster, and was for some time reporter for the Law Times in the Court of Exchequer, and at Nisi Prius for the Times and Daily News. Cope emigrated to Natal in 1851, but, attracted by the gold discoveries, proceeded to Victoria, where he arrived in April 1853, and was admitted to the local bar. In 1854 Cope was appointed Deputy Judge and Chairman of General Sessions for the Ballarat district, in place of Arthur Wrixon, and in 1858 was appointed Judge of the Court of Mines and of the County Court, and Chairman of General Sessions for the district of Beechworth, where he remained for ten years, when he became County Court Judge of Melbourne. Cope, who acted as a Judge of the Supreme Court for nearly a year in 1885 to 1886, during the absence of Chief Justice William Stawell, resigned his seat on the bench in April 1888, and retired on a pension. He was one of the counsel for the Ballarat rioters in 1855, and was an advanced Liberal in politics, holding that the State should resume all sold lands and administer the same for the public benefit. Cope died on 11 November 1891."

  "text" : "Thomas Thackeray Swinburne (April 21, 1865 – December 17, 1926) was an American poet from Rochester, New York. He has been called \"Rochester's poet laureate\" He wrote a number of books of verse which he printed himself; one of these—By the Genesee: Rhymes and Verses—contains a version of the poem which, set to music by Herve D. Wilkins, has become the alma mater of the University of Rochester – The Genesee. Swinburne attended the University of Rochester as a member of the class of 1892, but never graduated. He was a member of Theta Delta Chi fraternity. One critic compared Swinburne and Rochester in Song and Verse to Edgar Lee Masters and his Spoon River Anthology. In 1926, distraught over the death of his sister Rose, to whom he had dedicated By the Genesee and Rochester in Song and Verse, he committed suicide by jumping from a bridge into the Genesee River. The University of Rochester and the Rochester community honored Swinburne with a memorial, Swinburne Rock, placed \"beside the Genesee\" near the University's Interfaith Chapel. The memorial, proposed in 1927 and dedicated in 1933, is a 26 ton glacial boulder holding a bronze plaque with verses from The Genesee sculpted by Alphonse A. Kolb."

  "text" : "Teddy Carroll (born 1894) was one of the original factory test riders for the Indian Motocycle company and a member of the first generation of boys who had \"caught the fever\" to race a motorized bicycle. Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Carroll was practically raised in the backyard of the giant Hendee Mfg. Co. factory. At twelve, Teddy rode his first \"gasoline-fired\" two-wheeler and mastered the \"run, push, and jump-on style\" necessary to get the clutchless cycles underway. As a biographer later recalled: \"Many a tumble he took in the dust, but more than anything else, Teddy was determined to ride.\" By age 15 Teddy was driving an Indian Tricar van making deliveries for a laundry and then later for a department store. In 1912 he bought his first machine, a 7 horse-power Indian Twin and entered a series of Board Track races at the local Springfield Stadium (pictured below) built in 1909. Board Track racing was extremely dangerous, as the riders wore virtually no protective clothing, the machines had no brakes or suspension, and they depended on skinny skid-prone tires while race speeds crept ever closer to 100 mph. In the event of a crash the best a rider could hope for was a body full of long and infection-prone splinters. Plenty of riders came off far worse for their adventures. During the next few years the enthusiastic teenager raced at county fairs in various parts of New England earning for himself a collection of trophies and some small cash prizes. Then in 1914 Teddy Carroll realized his dream by landing a job in the testing room at the Indian (Hendee) factory. The following year the Springfield manufacturer furnished Teddy with an 8-valve machine with which he won his first professional competition, setting a new track record at the nearby one-mile dirt Readville Race Track. In the race, the Indian rider beat several notable members of the Harley-Davidson \"wrecking crew\" including Al Stratton and Irving Janke. In September, Carroll ran 2nd behind Carl Goudy in the famous 300-mile Chicago board track event, and in a follow-up 100-mile race in Milwaukee the Springfield rider again placed 2nd, this time behind H-D's, Leslie \"Red\" Parkhurst. Always a contender, and sometimes a champion, Edward \"Teddy\" Carroll was proud to wear the red and white colors of the Indian factory team. And although the sport of motorcycle racing continued on, Board Track racing fell out of favor due to the carnage of both rider and spectator, and by the early 1930s it had become a footnote in motorsport history."

  "text" : "Dr. Thomas Hale, Jr (born October 10, 1937) is an American physician and author who is best known for his 25 years of missionary work in the Himalayan Mountains of Nepal. Self described as \"deeply Christian\", Hale was driven to become a missionary due to his strong faith and devotion to God. Shortly after returning from his first trip, Hale began writing novels, some of which have received critical acclaim, about Christianity and life as a missionary. Upon his permanent settlement back in the United States, he served as a board member for both the International Nepal Fellowship (INF) North America and the MedSend organization. He continues to write and currently works alongside his wife as a lifelong advocate of missionary service."

  "text" : "Born circa 1928 in Brooklyn, NY, Rabbi Theodore Steinberg was a Conservative rabbi ordained at The Rabbinical School of the Jewish Theological Seminary. Upon retiring from serving as a pulpit rabbi, he moved to Jerusalem, Israel. In 1980, Rabbi Steinberg completed his dissertation \"Max Kadushin, Scholar of Rabbinic Judaism: A Study of His Life, Work, and Theory of Valuational Thought\" at New York University on the life of the rabbinics scholar Max Kadushin; Steinberg's work was the first scholarly volume on Kadushin's life and studies. In later life, Steinberg served (starting in 1996) as Associate Editor of the Jewish Bible Quarterly and volunteered regularly at the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens. Various responsa of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly credit him with having asked questions relevant to the subject matter dealt with in the published responsa (including issues of non-Halakhic conversions to Judaism, and the triennial cycle of Torah reading). Rabbi Steinberg died in 2009."

  "text" : "Theodor Undereyck (born June 15, 1635 in Duisburg, and died on January 1, 1693 in Bremen) was a Protestant pastor, spiritual writer and pioneer of pietism in the German Reformed Church. Theodor Undereyck was born in 1635 as the son of businessman Gerhard Undereyck and his wife Sara, née Salanger. After the death of his parents in 1636 by the plague, he grew up as an orphan in the house of his uncle Johann Undereyck in Alstaden. From 1653 to 1658 he studied Protestant theology in Duisburg, Utrecht, and Leiden, and among others, Gisbert Voetius and Johannes Cocceius (a student of Ludwig Crocius). Although his teachers were partly contrary to each other, but were orthodox Reformed theologians and representatives of Nadere Reformatie. In particular Cocceius strongly influenced him in the direction of a federally theological thought, so that he was also considered one of the \"big catechists of Coccejanismus\". Voetius influenced him in the direction of a puritanical way of life and its emphasis on the importance of Christian conventicles. From 1658 to 1659 Undereyck undertook a study trip to Switzerland, France, and England. In 1660, he became pastor of the Reformed church in Mülheim an der Ruhr. There he led approximately 1661 one of the first Pietist conventicles in Germany. From 1668 he was an associate court preacher in Kassel to Countess Hedwig Sophie (1623-1683). In 1670 he became pastor primarius in the community of St. Martini in Bremen and remained so until his death. In Bremen, he continued, despite initial difficulties with the clergy ministry through its reforms and helped there Pietism breakthrough. His followers Joachim Neander and Cornelius de Hare (whose funeral sermon provides valuable biographical information on Undereyck) translated and continued Undereyck's work. Undereyck published 5 books, including two catechisms and a lay dogmatics, in which he conveyed the ideas of the English and Dutch Reformed theology to German-speaking readers in edifying language. He dedicated his most extensive and sophisticated writing to the fight against emerging atheism."

He hails from the Queen's Drive area of Liverpool, but by 2001 was living at Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire. Neill left Bowaters to set up his own packaging and plastics business, exploited the new trend for own-branding by supermarkets and then sold out in 1995, when the annual turnover had reached £15m, to become a venture capitalist. Neill has had racehorses in training with Martin Pipe, Michael Bell and Richard Hannon, Sr.. His best horse was probably Gloria Victis, who had to be put down after running a tremendously brave race in the Tote Cheltenham Gold Cup at the 2000 Cheltenham Festival. Neill had gained his biggest win as an owner with his first-ever runner at the Festival, when Dark Stranger landed the Mildmay Of Flete Handicap Chase in the same year. Gloria Victis had previously given Neill another major win in the Racing Post Chase at Kempton in February of that year when, despite being a novice carrying top weight, he defeated experienced handicappers in impressive fashion. Neill was first reported to be in preliminary discussions to buy a major slice of Liverpool FC, the club he watched as a boy, in 1999, in partnership with Jersey-based property tycoon Steve Morgan. By the following year, he was the fourth largest shareholder in the club. He owned 3 per cent of the club by the time of a takeover bid in 2007."

  "text" : "Tim Rogers (born June 7, 1979) is an American video game journalist and developer. In games journalism, he is known for his association with mid-2000s New Games Journalism, his verbose writing style, and his video game reviews website ActionButton.net. The Guardian cited his 2005 \"Dreaming in an empty room: a defense of Metal Gear Solid 2\" as a core example of New Games Journalism, a style of video game journalism that emphasizes the author's subjective and personal experiences in relation to the game world. Rogers has also written for Next Generation, GamesTM, Play, Game Developer, and Kotaku. In game development, he is a co-founder of Action Button Entertainment, where he designed games including Ziggurat and Videoball. The four-person studio specializes in simple aesthetics and controls, following from Rogers's own video game aesthetic and minimalist eSports interests. He compared the studio's design philosophy to the spartan menu selections of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares."

In assessing his MVP season in October of 2015, the Japan Times wrote, \"Yamada had a 2015 the likes of which is seldom seen in Japanese baseball.\""

  "text" : "Terry Jones, nicknamed Large or Jonesy, (born June 25) is a Canadian journalist and author based in Edmonton, Alberta. He is currently a sports columnist with the Edmonton Sun. Jones was born in Lacombe, Alberta, the son of Doris Jones. He began his sports journalism career when he was in Grade 7 when he wrote sports stories for the Lacombe Globe. He had a syndicated sports column by the time he was in Grade 9, on high school football, published in rural Alberta newspapers. In Grade 10, Jones wrote for the Red Deer Advocate, a daily newspaper. In 1967, Jones began his career with the Edmonton Journal. He has covered the Edmonton Oilers from their World Hockey Association days to their present team. In 1982, Jones became sports columnist at the Edmonton Sun. During his career as a journalist, he has covered 16 Olympic Games (a Canadian journalism record), over 500 Stanley Cup Playoff games, over 37 Grey Cups, over 20 Super Bowl games, Briers, and countless Canada Cup and IIHF World Hockey Championships. Jones had also interviewed Joe DiMaggio, notorious for his media shyness, in the 1980s. He had also authored novels on the career of Wayne Gretzky. In 2011, Jones received the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the media category (along with Mickey Redmond). Upon this honour he was congratulated by, among many, the Edmonton Oilers and fellow Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky. Other honours he has received are the honour of Canadian Sports Media sportswriter of the year, and inductions into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame (2002) and Canadian Football Hall of Fame (2002). He is the third Edmonton sports media member to earn a place in the Hockey Hall of Fame, joining Rod Phillips and Jim Matheson. In 2012, he received a Lifetime Award, the Sports Media Canada George Gross Award for Career Achievement, from Sports Media Canada. He is also a recipient of the Dough Gilbert Award, Bell Memorial Award, Sun Media's ultimate journalism award in 2001, and the Doug Creighton Award for Editorial Excellence. He is married to Linda and has three children; a son, Shane (also a sports journalist), and twin daughters. He resides in Sherwood Park, Alberta."

By 1890 he was a long-serving member of Liverpool Council and was twice the mayor. In 1900 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in a by-election for the seat of Canterbury; he defeated sitting member Sydney Smith and does not appear to have belonged to any of the political parties of the time. Defeated by the Liberal candidate in 1901, he did not win office again, although he ran unsuccessfully for several more state and federal elections."

  "text" : "Sir Thomas Cooke (died 1478) was an English merchant and Lord Mayor of London. He was born the son of Robert Cooke of Lavenham in Suffolk and moved to London to became a draper. He was made Sheriff of London for 1453–54, an alderman from 1456 and Member of Parliament for the City of London in 1460 and 1470. He was elected Lord Mayor of London for 1462–63 and knighted in 1465.  In 1467 he began to build a mansion called Gidea Hall, near Romford in Essex, which was only completed by his descendant, Sir Anthony Cooke. In 1467 he was charged with high treason for lending money to Margaret, the queen of the deposed Lancastrian King Henry VI, on the strength of a confession of a statement obtained under torture from one Hawkins. Chief Justice Markham directed the jury to find it only misprision of treason, whereby Cooke's lands and life were saved, though he was heavily fined and long imprisoned. While awaiting his trial in the Tower his effects, both at his town house and at Gidea Hall, were seized by Lord Rivers, then treasurer of England, and his wife was committed to the custody of the mayor. On his acquittal he was sent to the Bread Street compter, and afterwards to the king's bench, and was kept there until he paid eight thousand pounds to the king and eight hundred pounds to the queen. Lord Rivers and his wife, the Duchess of Bedford, also obtained the dismissal of Markham from his office for having determined that Cooke was not guilty of treason. He died in 1478 and was buried in the church of the Augustine friars, within the ward of Broad Street in London. He had married Elizabeth, the daughter and coheiress of Alderman Philip Malpas, one of the leaders of the Lancastrian party within the city. They had one daughter and four sons, the eldest of whom was Philip, who was afterwards knighted. Thomas Cook'e will stated that he owned at least four brewhouses, taverns, and beerhouses, besides fishing-weirs on the Colne, a large farm at Gidea Hall, and numerous properties and manors in London, Surrey, Essex, and Kent."

After graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1937, she was hired by the Evansville Press in Indiana and was soon promoted to the position of tri-state editor. After working in Evansville, she moved to Indianapolis to marry television newscaster Bob Wilson and got a job on the Indianapolis Times. She later worked at the News Leader in Richmond, Virginia, where she began reporting on court cases, then at the Associated Press bureau in Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Bulletin before she and her husband moved back to her hometown of New York in 1952 and she was hired at the Daily News. She covered many major trials for the Daily News, with enough of them taking place in California that the paper suggested she open a West Coast bureau. The Los Angeles bureau opened in 1973 with Wilson as the primary correspondent. One problem that arose for her in Southern California was that like many New Yorkers, she did not drive. In 1976, when a school bus driver and the 26 children in his care were kidnapped in a small town 200 miles north of Los Angeles, she hailed a taxi to take her there. Following changes at the Daily News, Wilson accepted a buyout in 1982. She continued to write as a freelance journalist, covering trials for newspapers and cable television shows. Wilson divorced Bob Wilson in 1960. They had a son, Delph, born in 1946. She later developed a relationship with fellow journalist Doc Quigg. Her memoir, Headline Justice, was published in 1996. She died on January 17, 1997, in Los Angeles from a cerebral hemorrhage. Theo Wilson Square, an intersection in the Hollywood Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles where she lived for 25 years, was commemorated in 1997."

During the People Power Revolution of the 1980s, Concepcion joined “Movement for a Free Philippines,” serving as point person for the organization’s branch in Italy, where he lived to work on his art. His most famous works have been sculptures of celebrated men, including one of Aquino, in People’s Park in Manila; Rizal, in Rome; John Paul II, in Guam; and Pope Paul VI, in the Vatican. According to House Resolution no. 2495, introduced in his memory on June 7, 2012, Concepcion \"was a highly regarded artist ... with a socially conscious heart.\" In 1992, Concepcion was elected to the House of Representatives, where he served for four years as Representative of the Labor Sector for the 9th Congress of the Philippines. From that position, he defended the rights of overseas Filipino laborers. He later moved back to Italy, where he spent the rest of his life working on his artwork, including a bronze bust of U.S. President Barack Obama, which Concepcion had hoped to present to the White House."

In 2013, Stoner released “Small Change, Big Gains: Reflections of an Energy Entrepreneur,” which contains research about transforming the global energy supply to be more reliant upon sustainable fuel sources by the end of the century. Stoner is currently the CEO of Entelligent, a web-based platform that aggregates news and publishes original content and proprietary analytics on energy and the environment for US investors."

He was a grandson of Gerald Dillon, whose elder brother Sir Richard Dillon founded the senior branch of the family which held the title Earl of Roscommon. Thomas's father, another Richard Dillon, was a High Court judge. He entered the Inner Temple in 1559. Having been called to the Bar he briefly held office as justice of Wexford, then practiced on the Connacht circuit. He became Chief Justice of Connacht in 1577 in which office he gained a reputation for integrity, and was suggested as a possible Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1582. In 1593, despite the general understanding that a provincial Chief Justiceship should not be combined with a seat on the High Court Bench, he became a justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). He continued to spend most of his time in Connacht, but in 1596 he clashed with his formidable superior, Sir Richard Bingham, the Lord President of Connaught, and was committed to Dublin Castle as a result. He was restored to favour the following year, after Bingham himself suffered temporary disgrace and fled to England. He lived mainly at Curraghboy, County Roscommon, but suffered serious damage to his property during the Nine Years War. He died in 1606 and was buried in Dublin. He married Alice Shaen, sister of Sir Francis Shaen, ancestor of the Shaen Baronets. They had at least one son Robert (died 1628). Thomas's last direct male descendant Robert Dillon, 5th Baron Clonbrock, died in 1926."

  "text" : "Tina Keane (born 1940) is an artist who works with film, video, digital media, and performance and who has been a forerunner of multimedia art in the UK. Reflecting a feminist perspective, her works often explore gender roles and sexuality. Keane studied at Hammersmith College of Art and Sir John Cass School of Art (1967–70) and received an MA in Independent Film and Video from London College of Printing (1995–96). She is a founder member of the non-profit women’s film distribution organization Circles - Women in Distribution. Keane has also curated and programmed exhibitions and screenings including The New Pluralism exhibition at the Tate Gallery (with Michael O'Pray), 1985. She has been an important influence on successive generations of artists in the UK as a teacher at Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design, London, where she was Lecturer in Film & Video since 1982 and Research Fellow from 2003 to 2012. According to Malcolm Le Grice, \"During the 1970s and ’80s, the teaching of women artists – including Tina Keane, Anna Thew, Anne Tallentire, Joanna Greenhill and Pam Skelton –was one of Saint Martins’ major contributions to art education. Their influence helped create a lasting shift in the gender profile in British art, and Saint Martins in general maintained a committed concern for gender, ethnicity and sexual politics throughout the Thatcher years.” Notable students who were mentored by Keane include Sandra Lahire and Sara Turner. Her 1978 multimedia work, She, presented at the Hayward Gallery, London, in 1978 was an early example of performance that incorporated live video and slide projections. Transparencies of neon signs, poetry and images of shop windows featuring mannequins were projected on a wall before which Keane performed, while video of the performance played on monitors. Keane has said that the work brought into play \"the actual and the recorded, the shop dummy, and the person, the illusion and the reality\" Transposition, first presented at the Museum of Modern Art, Vienna in 1992, used the body as a screen with video projected onto the naked backs of men as they glide sideways standing on a travelator. Keane subsequently re-edited the piece into a double screen video installation for the inaugural Tanks programme at Tate Modern, London, in 2012. Details of her work can be found on the website of England & Co London, and Lux, London. In 2015, Keane was one of the recipients of the 21st annual Paul Hamlyn Foundation Awards for Artists, the largest individual awards made to visual artists and composers in the UK."

In a career spanning more than four decades, TK specialises in producing movies that promote Nigeria's rich cultural heritage and have a root in documentation, archiving, education, entertainment and promotion of the culture. He is also known for his love of adaptation of literary material into movies as most of his works have followed that style of filmmaking including Ko se Gbe, Oleku, Thunder Bolt, The Narrow Path, White Handkerchief, Maami and Dazzling Mirage. At an early age, he was sent to Abeokuta, to live with his grandparents. The rich Yoruba culture and tradition he experienced in his early years, coupled with the experience he garnered at the London Film School where he studied the art of filmmaking, prepared him for what he is doing today."

  "text" : "Thomas E. Davis (c1785-1878) was a prolific real estate developer who built residential properties in New York between 1830 and 1860. Davis emigrated from England to New Brunswick, New Jersey, with the intention of setting up a distilling business. When this failed he moved to New York, and with financial backing from banking brothers, J. L. & S Josephs, began a career in property speculation. In 1831 he built terraces of Federal style houses on East 8th Street, between Third & Second Avenue called St Mark’s Place. Further developments in the area included Carroll Place, on the block from Thompson Place to Laguardia Place. Between 1834 and 1835, Davis bought land on Staten Island, that ran from the quarantine station to Sailors' Snug Harbor. He called the area New Brighton (after a coastal resort in England) and built Greek revival style houses on the shoreline. An association of wealthy entrepreneurs was set up to further develop the land and promote the area as a suburb, with easy access to New York via steam ferries. However, almost immediately the financial crisis of 1837 resulted in foreclosure of the association. Davis, with co-partners, re-acquired the development and managed to ride out the recession. Davis lost a substantial amount of money during this period but survived the crash, however, the banking brothers, J. L.& S Josephs, who had initially provided support for Davis failed. Towards the end of the recession Davis was able to purchase 400 plots on Fifth Avenue (north of Twentieth Street) for a few hundred dollars each and built a complete block of fine dwellings between East 31st and East 32nd Street. Davis became extremely wealthy; the real estate owners’ list of the period placed Astor as number 1, A. T. Stewart 2nd and Thomas E. Davis 3rd. In the mid 1860s Davis moved with his family to Italy. He died in Florence 16 March 1878 aged 93."

  "text" : "Théodore (Teodoro) Caruel (27 June 1830, Chandernagor – 4 December 1898, Florence) was an Italian botanist of French-English parentage who specialized in flora of Tuscany. He was born in Chandernagor, a French colonial enclave north of Calcutta, where his father served as a French official. At the age of 15, he moved with his family to Florence, where soon afterwards, he developed an interest in natural sciences, in particular, flora native to Tuscany. In 1858 he began work as an assistant to Filippo Parlatore, and within a few years was given the title of coadjutor. With Parlatore, he conducted research at the Orto Botanico di Firenze (botanic museum of Florence) and worked on the development of the Florence herbarium. In 1862 he was named an associate professor at the scientific academy in Milan, returning to Florence one year later as a professor of botany at the medical college. In 1871 he transferred to Pisa, where he taught classes in botany at the Athenaeum, and in 1880, again returned to Florence, this time serving as director of its botanical institute. After his death, his herbarium was donated to the botanical institute at the University of Pisa. As a taxonomist, he circumscribed the plant families Sarcolaenaceae, Stemonaceae and Welwitschiaceae, and was the botanical authority of several genera and numerous species. The genus Caruelina (family Rubiaceae) was named in his honor by Otto Kuntze."

Chopin dedicated to him his Op. 2 Variations on \"Là ci darem la mano\". In 1830 Chopin visited Woyciechowski at his estate in Poturzyn, which he had inherited from his mother. Woyciechowski acted as a confidant during Chopin's passion for the singer Konstancja Gładkowska. Woyciechowski accompanied Chopin in his 1830 journey to Austria but, on learning of the November 1830 Uprising, returned to Warsaw to take part in the fighting. Whilst the two never met thereafter, they continued to correspond. Woyciechowski dedicated himself to agriculture, pioneered the introduction of crop rotation in Poland, and in 1847 founded one of the first sugar factories in the country. In 1861-62 he was an active member of the White Party, which took part in the failed January 1863 Uprising. The Woyciechowski collection of Chopin memorabilia was destroyed by fire in 1914, and the family manor house at Poturzyn was destroyed during the Second World War."

  "text" : "Tenagino Probus was a Roman soldier and procuratorial official whose career reached its peak at the end of the sixth decade of the third century AD (c. 255-260). A poverty of primary sources means that nothing is known for certain of his origins or early career. However, in later years he served successively as Praeses (governor) of the province of Numidia (i.e. Praeses Numidiae) and of Egypt, (i.e. Praefectus Aegypti). These were both very senior procuratorial offices, the latter in particular traditionally considered one of the pinnacles of an equestrian career. In these roles he exercised military skills in addition to administrative ones; as Praefectus Aegypti he led military operations outside his province. He died resisting the invasion of Egypt by the forces of Zenobia of Palmyra in the troubled inter-regnum between Emperors Claudius II and Aurelian. Despite the limited availability of information about Probus, the fact that he was: (i) entrusted with the government of two of the Empire's most economically and strategically significant provinces; and (ii) given important military command outside his province (at least during his time as Praefectus Aegypti) indicates that he had the reputation of a highly competent Imperial functionary. His known appointments suggest that both Emperor Gallienus and Gallienus' successor Claudius II held him in high regard. Probus was likely among the relatively small group of professional soldiers who benefited from the opening up of provincial governorships and senior military commands, which were previously reserved for senators."

  "text" : "Jetsunma Tamdrin Wangmo Kelzang Chokyi Nyima (1836–1896) was a Tibetan Buddhist teacher and vajramaster. She was taught by her father Kunga Richen, her brother Dorje Rinchen, and her paternal uncle, Pema Dudul Wangchuk. She received the three vows (prātimokṣa, bodhisattva and tantric) from the abbot of Sakya's Lhakhang Chenmo, Tashi Chopel. Later she was taught by the Fifty-third Ngor Khenchen, Jampa Kunga Tenpai Lodro, who gave her the complete Lamdre Lobshe as well as the major empowerment of the forty-five deities in Vajramāla, Hevajra, Vajrayoginī of the Nāropa tradition, Vajrakīlaya, Mahākāla Daṇḍa, Vajrapāṇi Bhūtaḍāmara, and Kurukulle. She taught her brother and other disciples. Upon her death she was given similar honors as the male lineage holders of the Khon family, as she had been in life, and a life-size silver Nāropa Vajrayoginī with gilded gold and inlaid with precious gems was made as her reliquary. She is considered by the Sakya tradition as an emanation of Vajra Nairātmyā and Vajravārahī."

After immigrating to Canada, he served on the city council and as mayor of Bury, Quebec. He was also a warden in Compton County, Quebec. Bennett moved to Strathcona in 1895 as an immigration agent. Upon Strathcona's incorporation as a town, Bennett would be elected as the town's first mayor in an election with around 700 votes cast. His council would consist of prominent Strathcona residents, including future Premier of Alberta, Alexander Cameron Rutherford. As mayor, Bennett took a conservative approach to affairs, in hopes of preventing debt to the town. He was an early pioneer of the education system in Strathcona, serving on the town's school board as a trustee which also included a stint as chairman. He died at his home in Strathcona in 1908 after a long illness; his body would later be taken by train to Sherbrooke, Quebec for interment after his funeral in Strathcona, which was attended by many citizens, as well as the incumbent city council and mayor. At the time of his death, he was serving as immigration agent for Strathcona once again. Built in 1912, the Bennett Centre, formerly known as Bennett School, which is located in present-day Edmonton, is named in Thomas Bennett's honour."

  "text" : "Thomas Henry Lowry (born 25 July 1865, Hastings, New Zealand, died 23 September 1944, Okawa, Hastings) was a New Zealand farmer, cricketer and racehorse breeder. Educated at Christ's College, Christchurch and at Jesus College, Cambridge University, Lowry inherited the family property, Okawa, of 20,000 acres, in the Hawke's Bay region of the North Island when his father died in 1880. He married Helen (\"Marsie\") Watt, daughter of the New Zealand shipping magnate James Watt, in 1897. One of Marsie's sisters married Robert Baden-Powell's brother Francis; another married the British explorer Ewart Grogan. Lowry played one first-class cricket match, captaining Hawke's Bay to victory over Taranaki in 1892. He constructed a cricket ground, \"The Grove\", on his property, which is still in use. He helped the Hawke's Bay Cricket Association bring out leading English professionals, including Albert Trott and Jack Board, to coach local players. He developed Okawa, which had been largely a sheep and cattle farm, into one of New Zealand's leading racehorse studs. He owned several successful horses, such as Gondolier, Madrigal, Downfall (New Zealand Cup, 1908), Bobrikoff (24 wins from 52 starts, including the 1912 Auckland Cup) and Balboa (Auckland Cup, 1915). His most prominent breeding success was the mare Desert Gold, who won her first 19 races, finished with 36 wins from 59 starts, and held the New Zealand record for the amount of money won for 30 years. In 1916, 1917 and 1918 Lowry was the leading owner in New Zealand in terms of stakes won. He and Marsie had five children between 1898 and 1904: Tom, who captained the Cambridge University cricket team and the New Zealand Test team and inherited Okawa; Jim (who won a tennis Blue at Cambridge University before returning to run part of Okawa); Ralph (Rugby union Blue at Cambridge, another Lowry farmer, and the author of the book Taihape: Be Happy, Die Happy); Gertrude (known as \"Beet\") (who married Tom's Cambridge University friend Percy Chapman, who captained the English Test cricket team); and Marion (who married Reg Bettington, Oxford University cricket captain and later medical specialist). Marsie was awarded the OBE in 1918 in recognition of her charitable work for soldiers during World War I. Early in World War II the Lowrys donated 10,000 pounds to the New Zealand Patriotic Fund for the construction of the \"Lowry Hut\" at Maadi Camp in Cairo. The \"hut\" was actually an extensive building incorporating a range of facilities for allied soldiers. Their daughter Beet worked there throughout the war. Lady Freyberg said of her work: \"her value as a morale-raiser to the NZEF [was] beyond price\"."

He was removed from office in December 2013 and placed under investigation by the Communist Party's anti-graft agency. Tong, as party chief of Hengyang, was the top official in charge of the overseeing the elections of delegates to the provincial People's Congress from the city in late 2012 and early 2013. Local media reported that several dozen delegates attempted to exchange money for votes during the municipal People's Congress. Tong was deemed to have been negligent during the process, having \"failed to conduct a thorough investigation on election abuses\". Tong was dismissed from all his posts and expelled from the Communist Party in 2014. He was convicted on charges of dereliction of duty, and sentenced to five years to prison."

He trained in the workshop of Antonio Calcagni and Girolamo Lombardo in Recanati. His first work is the statue of Pope Sixtus V, given to his hometown Camerino. In the aftermath of the election of a new Pope, this statue was done around the same time as Calcagni was working on a similar statue for Loreto, Marche (1585–1587) and follows the same compositional scheme. This generated a split between the two, who subsequently contributed separately to the main door of the Basilica della Santa Casa; Calcagni was entrusted to the door of the south side, the north side was given to Vergelli. For the baptismal font, Vergelli worked alongside Sebastian Sebastiani and Giovan Battista Vitali between 1600 and 1608. He died in 1609 in Recanati."

  "text" : "Tjayanka Woods is an Australian Aboriginal artist. She was one of the pioneers of the art movement across the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara lands, which began in 2000. She is best known for her paintings, but also a craftswoman who makes baskets and other woven artworks. Her paintings are held in the Art Gallery of Western Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the National Gallery of Australia. Woods was born about 1935. She was born close to Kaḻayapiṯi, a rock hole in the Great Victoria Desert of South Australia. She grew up living a traditional, nomadic way of life in the bush with her family, before any contact with Euro-Australian society. They often camped at Kaḻayapiṯi, and Woods and the other girls would gather bushfood together. She learned to carve basic tools and decorative objects, and to burn traditional patterns into the wood (this is called puṉu. She also learned to spin hair string on a hand-spun spindle and weave head rings and ceremonial belts from hair and feathers. Woods began painting in 2000, after moving to Irrunytju. The women there opened an art centre as a community-owned economic project, called Irrunytju Arts. From the beginning of her career, Brown often painted with her friend Anmanari Brown. When Brown's husband died in 2007, the two women left Irrunytju and went to live at Papulankutja, on Ngaanyatjarra lands. Here, they painted for Papulankutja Artists. In April 2010, the two women held their first solo exhibition together at the Vivien Anderson Gallery in Melbourne. Woods has had two of her paintings chosen as finalists for the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award, in 2006 and 2008. Woods' paintings are mostly about the Minyma Kutjara Tjukurpa (Two Sisters Dreaming), which is her personal Dreaming. They are structured like maps drawn in the sand, tracing the journey of the two sisters around the edge of the canvas. She paints in earthy colours, and uses solid and dotted lines in concentric circles to depict the journeys and activities of figures in the story."

Fly died suddenly on 17 June 2016. London label Nice Up! Records summed up Fly's life with a statement: \"Without a doubt one of the legends of the soundsystem scene here in the UK and a talent that spread across the world. From dancehall, reggae and hip hop to jungle, his style and influence cannot be understated—an original roughneck rudeboy. Not only a consummate artist and performer, but a genuinely nice guy too.

He was probably as Thierry d'Orca and Aymar de Lairon one of the Crusaders who remained in the Holy Land after the end of the Third Crusade. In 1204 came from the Holy Land and was with Hugh II of Saint Omer and his brother Ralph with a contingent of troops to Constantinople, where his compatriot Baldwin of Flanders, had just been crowned after the Fourth Crusade Emperor of the Latin Empire. Baldwin there named Thierry as constable. According to Geoffrey of Villehardouin Thierry died in the spring of 1206 at the Battle of Rusion (also Roussillon or Rusium) in Thrace fighting against Bulgarians."

  "text" : "Tullio Simoncini (born 1951) is an Italian former physician and alternative medicine advocate. He holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from La Sapienza University. He is known for claiming that cancer is caused by the fungus Candida albicans, and has gone so far as to say that cancer is actually a form of candida overgrowth. He also says that cancer can be cured with injections of sodium bicarbonate. He says that he was formerly an oncologist, but that he was struck off because he prescribed sodium bicarbonate instead of conventional chemotherapy. The mainstream medical community has rejected Simoncini's hypothesis, citing a lack of peer-reviewed studies that support its use. Quackwatch lists sodium bicarbonate injections as a \"dubious treatment.\""

It was among the retinue of Count Henry II of Champagne, who ascended as King of Jerusalem in 1192. This allowed him to marry Melisende, the heiress of the Lordship of Arsuf. With Melisande had seven daughters, who were killed before him. Thus died without heirs in 1207. After his death, his widow married with John of Ibelin, the \"Old Lord of Beirut.\""

She is a professor at the Catholic University of Uruguay. She grew up in Montevideo. From 1978-1981, she collected oral histories of Jewish immigrants which was published as Life Stories of Jewish Immigrants to Uruguay in its first edition in Spanish in 1986. In a review for the American Jewish Archives, Alejandro Lilienthal called it a good introduction to the subject, but criticized the work as not containing any original analysis; outside of the transcriptions of the oral histories, the context in the introduction was simply compiled work that others had previously published. Her fiction is part of a tradition of works expressing erotic desires created by Uruguayan women. In 1992, she received a Guggenheim Fellowship, during which she studied the Sephardim and rabbinic lore. She has also received a Fulbright scholarship."

Hyatt befriended John Brown and provided Brown with financial support; following the raid on Harpers Ferry, Hyatt was investigated by a committee of the United States Senate. When Hyatt refused to comply with a Congressional subpoena and cooperate with the Senate investigation, the Senate voted to jail the recalcitrant abolitionist. As an inventor, Hyatt was a wealthy man, profiting from his invention of iron-and-glass vault covers for sidewalks. Hyatt also innovated and patented several designs for reinforced concrete floors."

Roberts was born in Stanley Mission, Saskatchewan to a northern Cree family who made their living as trappers, fishers, and tour guides. The family's trapline was at Forbes Lake, a remote lake about 50 kilometres north of Otter Lake. Dissatisfied with trapping, Roberts left to pursue studies in La Ronge and Yorkton, eventually finding work as an airfreight radio operator and a Cree–English translator. This experience led to him being offered a job as a broadcast radio announcer by the Department of Northern Saskatchewan. Roberts's Cree-language broadcasts became the first indigenous-language programming in Saskatchewan. In 1982, premier Grant Devine's government dissolved the Department and cancelled its communications program, and the following year Roberts joined CBC Radio. Roberts became the host of Keewatin Country, a one-hour news magazine broadcast weekdays at noon. He remained in this position until his retirement in 2010. In 2003, Roberts was awarded the Women of the Dawn's First Nations Award for journalism."

  "text" : "Tulsidas Balaram (born 30 November 1936), also known as Tulsidas Balaraman, is a retired footballer from India who had represented the country in international competitions including Olympics games. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest football strikers, India has ever produced. Balaram made his mark playing football for the East Bengal Club in Kolkata. He was one of the best players of the golden age of Indian football of 1950's and 1960's. His playing position was as a center forward or as a left winger. Balaram’s performances against International teams are no less spectacular. He was one of the prime components of India’s Gold winning team of 1962. He played every single game and scored goals against Thailand and Japan. Balaram came during Rome Olympics anticipated his pass to make the scoreline 2-1. India didn’t defeat Hungary but almost upset ’58 World Cup semi-finalists France few days later. Balaram was again unstoppable as India held on to a 1-0 lead deepinto second half. Sadly, a mistake from Ram Bahadur denied India a famous victory. According to Balaram’s best game for India came against Hong Kong in 1958 Asian Games. The match went into extra time after the scoreline was 2-2 during normal time. Balaram showed peak performance in extra time, assisting two goals and scoring once as Indiaran out 5-2 victors. Famous journalist Ajay Basu described Balaram as superb inside forward. Basu further said that his improvisation, industriousness and ability to hit curling shots were second to none. While Chuni Goswami had more flair in his play, Balaram had more variety and versatility. Former India International and eminent defender Arun Ghosh described Balaram as a man who had two eyes on the back of his head – so good was his ball distribution. He was also the heart of his teams, directing every attacking move. In 1961 Balaram was selected as East Bengal captain – he led from the front and played one of his best ever seasons. He top scored with 23 goals, won the league’s best player awardand also led his club to do a double over Mohun Bagan. His popularity among the Red & Golds faithful knew no bounds. In early 60s, Mohun Bagan’s Dhiren De once tried hard to sign Balaram for the club. Balaram retired in 1963 owing to health related issues. His absence was strongly felt by the Indian team in Asian Cup the following year. For a footballer whose popularity and performances in all versions of the game has few parallels, Balaram’s life is full with far too many cases of shoddy treatment. Some of it took place during his playing days, incredibly. As coach of Calcutta Mayor’s XI Balaram played a part in bringing up players like Basudev Mandal and Sangram Mukherjee. However, he had to face hurdles in every step. When a youth team under his coaching got an invitation to play in Germany, his visa was denied by Indian Govt. AIFF under Priyaranjan Dasmunshi refused to clear his visa on time. His team eventually played wonderfully in Berlin, remaining unbeaten in four games. Two years back he finally received some much needed recognition from East Bengal club though he is yet to receive his Padma Shri, according to a short interview published in Anandabazar Patrika in 2001."

  "text" : "Thomas Cusacke (died c.1496) was an Irish barrister and judge, who held the offices of Attorney General for Ireland and Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. He should not be confused with his much younger cousin Thomas Cusack, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who was a child of about six when the elder Thomas died. Elrington Ball states that he belonged to a junior branch of the well-known landowning Cusack family of County Meath. He was thus a cousin of John Cusack of Cussington: John was the father of the Lord Chancellor, Thomas Cusack, and ancestor, through his granddaughter Catherine Colley, of the Duke of Wellington. Thomas is first heard of in London in 1472 as a law student: he went to London, in his own words: \"so as to thoroughly ground himself in the King's law\", and he was given a licence to import grain into Ireland. He was made Attorney General for Ireland in 1480. Like nearly all the senior judges and lawyers in Ireland in that era he was a client of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, who was almost all-powerful in Ireland for 30 years. Kildare and his faction made the mistake of supporting Lambert Simnel, pretender to the English Crown, who was decisively defeated at the Battle of Stoke Field in 1487. The victorious King Henry VII was merciful to the Irish rebels (as indeed he was to Simnel himself, who became an official of the Royal household). He issued a royal pardon for the great majority of them, including Cusacke, who became Lord Chief Justice in 1490. Henry's clemency had limits, and his strong suspicion that the Anglo-Irish nobility were aiding another pretender, Perkin Warbeck, led to Kildare's temporary downfall in 1494. The new Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Edward Poynings, undertook a general purge of the Irish judges, including Cusacke who was replaced by the eminent English lawyer Thomas Bowring. From 1496 onwards Kildare regained much of his influence, and some of his former allies on the bench returned to power, but no more is heard of Cusacke, which suggests that he had died sometime between 1494 and 1496."
