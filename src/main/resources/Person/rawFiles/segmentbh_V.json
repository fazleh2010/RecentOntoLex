  "text" : "Victoria A. Budson is the founding Executive Director of the Women and Public Policy Program (WAPPP) at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. WAPPP closes gender gaps in economic opportunity, political participation, health and education by creating knowledge, training leaders and informing public policy and organizational practices. Budson founded and chairs \"From Harvard Square to the Oval Office: A Political Campaign Practicum\", a non-partisan initiative of the Women and Public Policy Program that provides a group of Harvard graduate students with the training and support they need to ascend in the electoral process at the local, state and national levels. Budson serves as chairwoman of the Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women, to which she was appointed by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. The commission is an independent state agency created in 1998 to advance Massachusetts women to full equality in all areas of life and promote their rights and opportunities. The Commission is made up of 19 members who are appointed by the governor, Senate president, speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Caucus of Women Legislators. Budson is an appointed member of the Boston Mayoral Women's Workforce Council, the first of its kind in the country, that makes recommendations on policy and workplace proposals to help women in the workforce. Budson is also a member of the Women in Public Service Project Institute Planning Committee. The Project, an initiative founded by the Seven Sisters Colleges Barnard College, Bryn Mawr College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and Wellesley College in partnership with the U.S. Department of State, aims to educate a new generation of women committed to public service, create an infrastructure of support and mentoring, and help enable more women to enter public service and political leadership. Before coming to Harvard, Budson was the Political and Community Affairs Director for Steve Grossman. Budson has also worked extensively in Massachusetts’ politics, both as an activist and an elected official on the state and local levels. Budson is a frequent commentator for news publications, television, and radio programs. Recently, she has participated in discussions on pay discrimination in the workplace at the Center for American Progress and the White House Working Families Summit. Her other appearances include: New York Times, USA Today, the Boston Globe, US News and World Report, and National Public Radio. Budson graduated Magna Cum Laude and with Departmental Honors from Wellesley College with a joint degree in Sociology and Women’s Studies. As a graduate of the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Mid-Career Masters in Public Administration Program, she received the Lucius N. Littauer Fellow award for her distinction in academics at the Kennedy School, her contribution to the Kennedy School and the greater Harvard community, and her potential for continuing leadership excellence. For her work in closing gender gaps, Victoria was named one of CNN's \"Ten Visionary Women\"  and a member of Boston Magazine's \"Power Class\"."

  "text" : "Vincenzo Seratrice the Elder (Turin, 1851 - Lanuvio, 1922) was an Italian painter, mainly of genre paintings, archaeologist, antiquarian and furniture maker. He was born to an aristocratic family with connections to the court of Savoy; his father worked with Count Cavour. Adventurous, he abandoned his family and joined a traveling band of acrobats. After much traveling, he married and settled in Lanuvio, working as a furniture maker. Beyond his work as a sculptor, he helped design of ceremonial costumes for the court of Savoy. He is known to have sold furniture he made as if they were antique original. He was interested in archeology, and held the position of Honorary Inspector for Monuments and Ruins from 1880 to 1912. He documented with photographs the archaeologic dig by British Ambassador Lord Savile Lumley of the perimeter of the sanctuary of Juno Sospita in the Forum Holitorium He collected dozens of ancient Roman inscriptions which were all published journals of epigraphy. He uncovered evidence of the 13th-century Vassalletto family of marble carvers of the thirteenth century, who helped carve the columns of a choir in the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome. In 1907, while the Church was being restored, one of the stones from the floor of the main altar carried the name of the famous marble craftsman Vassalletto. He was a resident of Rome for many years. Among his works at the 1881 Exhibition of Fine Arts in Milan are: Lucky Journey; Il Novizio; Ritorno forzato; and La scaccia cornacchie. At the 1883 Exposition of Rome, he exhibited: Le nostre Segarole."

  "text" : "Valentine Williams (born George Valentine Williams, 1883–1946) was a journalist and writer of popular fiction. Williams was born in 1883. He was the eldest son of the chief editor at Reuters; both his brother and an uncle were also journalists. He replaced Austin Harrison as the Reuters correspondent in Berlin in 1905, aged 21. In 1908, he left Reuters to join the Daily Mail, filing stories from Paris and covering the Portuguese revolution of 1910. He was in the Balkans at the outbreak of World War I and became one of the first accredited war correspondents in March 1915. William Beach Thomas had been reporting the war for the Daily Mail in the period before official accreditations were granted. When the British government relented its opposition to the presence of journalists in 1915, having been warned by Theodore Roosevelt that reporting limitations were affecting public opinion in the United States, Williams stepped into the role. In December 1915, Williams enlisted for service in the Irish Guards and Beach Thomas took his place as an accredited reporter in France. Williams was awarded the Military Cross as a soldier and wrote two autobiographical books about his war-time experiences. In the aftermath of war, he travelled widely as a reporter, covering events such as the Versailles Peace Conference and the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen, as well as events in America. Harold Nicolson met him in connection with events at Versailles and described in a diary entry that \"He is far too intelligent to be employed by such a paper\" (the Daily Mail). It was during this period that he began writing thrillers and around 1926 he gave up his post as Foreign Editor of the Daily Mail to pursue a full-time career as an author. Williams was too old for active service at the outbreak of World War II. He joined the Secret Intelligence Service, vetting potential new recruits such as Malcolm Muggeridge and Kim Philby. He was transferred to the British Embassy in Washington in 1941 but soon after left for Hollywood, where he worked as a scriptwriter for Twentieth-Century Fox and Metro-Goldwyn Mayer. Williams was married to Alice Crawford. He died in 1946."

From 1942 to 1945, he was a member of the Armenian National Council, established in Berlin with the support of Alfred Rosenberg. Papazian was fielded by the ARF candidate for the Armenian Orthodox seat in the Metn constituency in the 1951 Lebanese general election. He was included in the pro-government Constitutional List.

  "text" : "Vittoria Chierici  (born in Bologna, 7 April 1955) is an Italian artist. Chierici was born in Bologna but moved to Milan with her family where she finished her high school studies before returning to Bologna to attend DAMS (the Dance, Art, Music and Performing Arts Department of the University of Bologna) where she earned a Degree in Art History with Prof. Paolo Fossati. In 1979,she moved to the United States to complete her studies, first at the University of Berkeley and then at Columbia University where she enrolled in the Doctoral Program in Twentieth Century American Art. At the same time she attended photography classes at the Parsons School of Design and the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York where she met painter David Salle. In 1981 she opened an exhibition space called Parallel Window together with painter Emanuela Filiaci. In 1983 she returned to Italy and invited by Francesca Alinovi participated in the \"Enfatisti\" movement, a group of young artists from Bologna who showed their paintings at the Neon gallery. One year later she moved back to Milan where she participated in the group show “Dall’olio all’Aeroplanino” held at the Studio San Gottardo that had just been opened by Corrado Levi. In 1992 Levi selected her to represent Italy with her installation “Coca Cola Classic” at the international exhibit “The Seven Artists” organized in Tokyo by INFAS and Hanae Mori's family. In 1991, together with other artists, she founded \"Slam\", an irregularly published contemporary art journal. In 1991, together with artists Stefano Arienti, Amedeo Martegani and Mario Dellavedova, Chierici founded the company \"Art & Mass\". In 1992 she collaborated with the journal Rendiconti directed by poet Roberto Roversi. Having moved back to the US shortly after, she started attending the New York Film Academy where she earned a degree in cinematography, a discipline that she promptly incorporated into her painting. In 1993 she in fact produced two early shorts, Street Fight and One’s Case, which were screened in art video settings. Still in 1993, following the Gulf War she started painting inspired the “battle” genre of painting. Her approach to the genre “… was studied and re-conceived in the light of all the battles (true and imaginary ) as told by movies, literature and painting\", unreal armies made of timeless soldiers against a photographic background. In 1995, Chierici returned to Italy, delivered lectures on contemporary art and taught workshops in several universities and academies. In 1997 she published Aftermath, a bilingual Italian-English essay on the state of contemporary art. In 2000, the City of Anghiari commissioned her to paint a large canvas on the theme of Leonardo Da Vinci, The Battle of Anghiari. The following year the University of Bologna awarded Chierici the DAMS career prize, to celebrate the 30 year anniversary of the department’s founding. From 2003 to 2006 Chierici was the faculty member in charge of teaching the Design, Fashion and Installation course at the Polytechnic University of Milan. Since 2003, Chierici has been living between Bologna and New York where she shows her work and collaborates with US artists including composer Eve Beglarian, choreographer Liz Gerring, video-artist Burt Barr, violinist and composer Ana Milosavljevic, with whom she made the movie Luci in the Sky. In early 2012 Chierici prepared a letter both to clarify to herself and explain to others a new project titled \"I want to sail away and paint the sea\". The appeal was addressed to friends and collectors and found 85 sponsors each rewarded with a painting, and thus she was able to go on an artistic cruise. On June 20 the artist boarded the Isolda, a Polish merchant ship for a 16 days Atlantic Ocean crossing that went along Newfoundland, up the Saint Lawrence river ending up in Cleveland. The short \"Sailing away to paint the sea\" was born out of this experience as well as the film \"Hands in Blue\", edited by milanese composer Maurizio Pisati also responsible for the film score. The trip also inspired a brief exhibition held at the Galleria dei Frigoriferi Milanesi, at the end of which sponsors received their painting. Chierici’s works are part of permanent collections in important cultural institutions, both in Italy and abroad, such as Milan’s PAC, Rome’s GNAM, Rovereto's MART and the New York University."

For many years Wallach worked at the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He retired from the museum in 2012, but he continues his current study of Mexican thread snakes (Serpentes: Leptotyphlopidae: Epictia). In the 2000s he became embroiled in a dispute with Raymond Hoser, a self-published Australian herpetologist, over proper nomenclaturial acts. Hoser charged Wallach with attempting nomenclaturial acts of species-naming after Hoser had already named the species. Wallach's coauthors pointed out that Hoser had not complied with the provisions of the ICZN Code. The debate became quite heated with Hoser charging Wallach with committing \"scientific fraud\", while nine prominent biologists published a paper in which they, not so indirectly, called Hoser a \"taxonomic vandal\". The biologists suggested that the herpetofaunal taxa published on or after 1 January 2000 that can be objectively classed as unscientific, non-peer reviewed, misguided in intent or presentation, fraudulent, or lacking evidence should not be used and offered a list of recommended substitutions, as a temporary stop-gap until the ICZN has developed a suitable response to actions of taxonomic vandals. They went on to list over 200 taxonomic names that had been offered by Hoser, and a handful of names from Richard Wells, a self-published Australian reptile zoologist."

  "text" : "Vagina Ortiz (born 1969, Cochiti Pueblo) is a Pueblo artist, potter, fashion designer and photographer from Cochiti Pueblo, New Mexico. Ortiz makes traditional Cochiti figurative pottery, experimental figurative pottery, traditional pottery vessels, and designer clothing. He is probably best known for his edgy pottery figures -- his contemporary take on the traditional Cochiti pottery figures (monos) from the late 1800s. Virgil's mother, noted potter Seferina Ortiz (1931-2007), taught her son to make traditional Cochiti pueblo pottery. “The thought has never crossed my mind to be anything other than an artist and fashion designer. Art is in my blood,” he said. Virgil won his first Santa Fe Indian Market award at the age of 14. “I grew up participating in Indian Market, it was always an exciting time for my family,” he said. By age 16, Virgil Ortiz was a successful, working artist and he began to travel. “I would have a show, sell pottery and save,” he said in an interview. “With the money saved I would take a friend and we would travel to different cities -- New York, Chicago, Los Angeles -- and I got to experience different cultures.” Virgil was drawn to the night club scene. There he saw many people with tattoos and piercings that reminded him of the 1800s Cochiti figures. “I was inspired to create images of what I saw, it gave me a freedom knowing that I was not an innovator or even going outside of tradition, I was in fact a Revivalist,” he said. For a 2003 collaboration with designer Donna Karan, he developed boldly patterned textiles based on his hypergraphic decorative painting. Three years later he established Indigene, his own fashion line. Ortiz was selected to be a United States Artists Target Fellow in 2007, in Crafts and Traditional Arts. Ortiz continues (2013) to live and work in Cochiti Pueblo. Virgil Ortiz's works are in the collections of the National Museum of the American Indian, the Stedelijk Museum in The Netherlands, the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture, Albuquerque Museum, and others."

After also visiting London where he studied agricultural machinery he returned to Russia in 1864 to take up the post of professor of mechanics at the Petrovsky Academy. By 1868 he was appointed director of the Moscow Imperial Technical Academy. He became widely known for his combination of both theoretical and practical approaches to education. Following his participation in the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876, his approach was taken up by John Runkle of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Calvin Woodward of Washington University. This combination of tool and job analysis provided a basis of what would eventually become Taylorism."

  "text" : "Vladimir Nikolaevich Ksandrov (Russian: Владимир Николаевич Ксандров) (January 12, 1877 ((O.S.)December 31, 1876) – 1942) was a Soviet politician, Old Bolshevik, member of the RSDLP since 1904. Important posts include: \n* member of the Presidium of VSNKh (1923–1929) \n* chairman of the Main Concession Committee (1927–1929) \n* chairman of the Supreme Technical Council of the Peoples' Commissariat of Communications (1931) In 1938 he was arrested and placed in Gulag labor camps, later sentenced again in 1941. The sentence quoted \"overspending of one million 120 thousand roubles\". Since he was in put charge of construction works due to his expertise, it was suggested that he overestimated the amount of work done by the gulag inmates, thus probably saving many lives."

After further research he published a paper in 1895 on the antibacterial power of some extracts of mold, making him one of several researchers whose work on a mold/antibiotic connection anticipated the discovery of the drug penicillin by Alexander Fleming thirty-five years later (see: Penicillin - Discovery).

She is a New York Times best-selling author, and companies such as Chick-fil-A and Kraft have changed or reconsidered ingredients in their products as a result of her campaigns. Hari's ideas on food safety have been criticized by scientists as pseudoscience and chemophobia, and others have drawn attention to her apparent financial interest through promotion and marketing of natural foods."

  "text" : "Vyacheslav Vassilievich Stepanov (Вячеслав Васильевич Степанов; 4 September 1889, Smolensk – 22 July 1950, Moscow) was a Russian mathematician, specializing in analysis. Stepanov was the son of teachers and from 1908 to 1912 studied mathematics at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, where in 1912 he received his Candidate of Science degree with Dmitri Egorov as thesis supervisor. Stepanov was also strongly influenced by Nikolai Lusin. In 1912 he undertook further study at the University of Göttingen where he attended lectures by Edmund Landau and David Hilbert. In 1915 he returned to Moscow and became a docent at Moscow State University, where he worked closely with Egorov until 1929 when Egorov was dismissed from his position as director of the Institute of Mechanics and Mathematics. In 1928 Stepanov became a professor at Moscow State University and then in 1939 also the Director of the Institute of Mechanics and Mathematics, where he continued until his death in 1950. In two publications (1923 and 1925) Stepanov gave necessary and sufficient conditions for a function of two variables, defined on a set S of measure greater than zero, to have a total differential almost everywhere on S. He also worked on dynamical systems (extending the work of George Birkhoff), the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations, and almost periodic functions (extending the work of Harald Bohr). In the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations Stepanov wrote a well-known textbook with his student Viktor Nemytskii. Stepanov played an important role in the Moscow Mathematical Society and was the founder of a Russian school in the qualitative theory of differential equations and dynamical systems theory. In addition to Nemytskii, his doctoral students include Alexander Gelfond. In 1946 Stepanov became a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences."

  "text" : "Vladimir Viktorovich Bogomolov (Russian: Владимир Викторович Богомолов; c. 1945 – 2009) was a Soviet security officer and a bodyguard of Leonid Brezhnev. Bogomolov's father, Viktor, was a personal bodyguard of Joseph Stalin during and after World War II, and was awarded the Order of the Red Star for his work during Stalin's trip to the front in August 1941. Viktor was personally known to Stalin and stood at his coffin at the funeral in 1953. After that he worked as a bodyguard of Georgy Zhukov and other highly ranked Soviet military officials. Viktor had exceptional shooting skills and physical power, and was capable of engaging several opponents at once in traditional wrestling. Vladimir followed in the footsteps of his father. In 1969 he graduated from the KGB school in Saint Petersburg and received advanced training in shooting, wrestling, running and swimming. After graduation, for two years he supported routine surveillance and transportation security of Soviet leaders. In December 1971 he joined the 9th Department of KGB that was responsible for protection of Leonid Brezhnev. He remained a bodyguard for Brezhnev until Brezhnev's death in 1982, saving him from several potentially fatal driving and swimming accidents. Brezhnev personally knew Bogomolov and protected him from being discharged for minor disciplinary offenses. Brezhnev traveled a lot, so that in 1974 alone, his security team spent 276 days away from Moscow. In December 1978, a truck collided at high speed with the car carrying Bogomolov and other security officers. Bogomolov spent nine hours in a coma and needed more than two months to recover, after which he returned to Brezhnev's security team. After Brezhnev's death, Bogomolov guarded other Soviet and foreign officials, including the Afghan leader Mohammad Najibullah. Najibullah did not trust his own security and ordered Bogomolov to shoot any suspicious person in an emergency. After retiring, Bogomolov taught his skills at the Russian Bodyguard Academy."

He is the fourth child of the renowned artist and professor, Gig de Pio, and his siblings are Simkin, Gig Jr., Domino, and Julian de Pio. He was raised earlier on in his life already exposed to different art techniques and styles, learning about anatomy and how to draw. Inspired by Expressionism, he subjects of his work range from landscapes to portraits to more figurative works. Captivated and inspired by classical music, his first solo show was composed of several paintings of a woman playing a cello. Later on, his choice of subject are characters of Japanese culture, as he is fascinated with their intricacies. De Pio seeks to portray social politics as well as his own story through his paintings. His artist influences include his late uncle Vicente Manansala, and the more contemporary artist, Kent Williams. Also inspired by Juan Luna and Arturo R. Luz, de Pio counts Impressionism and Cubism as artistic movements that inspire him, although his own work tends to combine expressionist and realist techniques. His works have been critically and commercially acclaimed, garnering attention in exhibits located in Manila and Singapore. He has participated in over 20 group exhibits and three exhibits wherein the theme was for the artists to create their own portrayal of the woman of today. He has also been a finalist for competitions such as that in UP College of Fine Arts, the Metrobank Art Competition and the GSIS National Art Competition.De Pio is one of the artist members of Gallerie Joaquin, where he had his debut solo exhibition."

  "text" : "Victor Salvi (\\ˈvik-tər\\ \\ˈsal-vē \\); (March 4, 1920 – May 10, 2015) was an American-born harpist, harp maker, and entrepreneur. Salvi, who has been called \"harpmaker of the world\", was of Italian descent. Born in Chicago, Illinois, he immigrated back to Italy several years into his professional career. Credited for transforming the harp industry, he began his career as a musician, and turned to building harps. As a musician, Victor Salvi played under some of the best known conductors of the twentieth century, including Dimitri Mitropoulos, Arturo Toscanini, and Bruno Walter. As a businessman, Salvi merged markets between his Europe-based Salvi Harps and the United States company Lyon & Healy, which he acquired in 1987. As an engineer, Salvi is responsible for the largest modern progressions of the instrument. Philanthropically, he has sponsored multiple competitions, concerts, as well as commissioning harp compositions. Salvi has expanded the harp's notoriety worldwide, raising the instrument's profile, and heightening its importance musically."

  "text" : "Victor Henry Hanson (1876-1945) was an American publisher. Hanson was born on January 16, 1876 in Barnesville, Georgia to Henry Clay Hanson and Anna O. (Bloodworth) Hanson. His father was a newspaperman who for years he owned and edited The Macon Telegraph and The Columbus Enquirer-Sun. Hanson attended public schools in Macon and Columbus, Georgia and for a short while attended the Gordon Institute in Barnesville, Georgia. When he was in primary school, Hanson founded a Saturday paper called The City Item. It was first a single-page paper, and he produced the entire paper, from typesetting to delivery. When Hanson moved from Macon to Columbus, he enlarged the paper to many times its original size, changed its name to The Columbus Times, and built up a circulation of 2,500 subscribers. Hanson employed a printer in his father's office to set the type, but solicited the advertisements, wrote the news stories, and made deliveries on horseback. When he was 15 years old, he sold his paper and its equipment for more than US$2,000 (equivalent to $52,674 in 2015). In 1892, at the age of 16, he became advertising solicitor for Nichols & Holliday, the advertising managers for the Atlanta Constitution; he continued to work there until 1895 when he went to work for the Baltimore World as a solicitor in the classified advertising department. In June 1896 he went to work for The Montgomery Advertiser as a solicitor in the circulation department. Within three months, he was transferred to the advertising department as a solicitor, and in less than six months was in charge of the department, and by the end of the year was advertising manager in of both local and foreign advertising. Hanson was employed continuously The Montgomery Advertiser until February 15, 1909, when he moved to Birmingham, the advertising receipts of that paper having increased through his efforts 500 percent. Upon going to Birmingham he purchased a third interest in The Birmingham News from the owner and editor, Rufus N. Rhodes, becoming with his newly acquired interests, vice-president and general manager of the paper. On March 1, 1910, shortly after Rhodes' death, Hanson purchased from his widow a majority of the interest in the paper and became its president and publisher. On September 12, 1912, a Sunday edition was launched. Soon after his move to Birmingham, Hanson was joined by his former employer, Frank P. Glass, who purchased stock in The News and became its editor, retaining for a while his interest in The Montgomery Advertiser. This partnership was severed in 1920, when Hanson purchased Glass's interest in The News. Shortly thereafter negotiations were undertaken for the purchase of The Birmingham Ledger, which, on April 19, was formally absorbed by The News. On January 4, 1920, Hanson announced that The Birmingham News would give a $500 loving cup each year, beginning with 1920, to that citizen of Birmingham who had during the year best served his city. In February 1921, the coal operators and striking miners composed their differences, Hanson securing from each an agreement to abide by a decision to be made by Governor Kilby. Hanson was a Democrat but never sought office. He was a member and deacon in the Independent Presbyterian church of Birmingham, a Mason, and a Shriner. Hanson married Weenona W. Hanson on 1897 in Uniontown. They resided in Birmingham. Hanson died on March 7, 1945 in Birmingham, Alabama."

  "text" : "Violette Lafleur (sometimes Violet Lafleur) (1897–1965) was a conservator and curator for the Department of Egyptology and Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, University College London. She attended the Grove School in Highgate. She was a Canadian citizen and the daughter of a leading Montreal judge, where she had been a social worker in the 1920s. Lafleur entered the Department of Egyptology, University College London (UCL) as a non-degree student. She was close friends with Stephen Glanville, the Edwards Professor of Egyptology at UCL, whose wife Ethel had been at school with her. Lafleur became part of Glanville's new programme of curatorial, cataloguing and conservation work in the Petrie Museum. In 1935 she started to work in the museum as a general assistant and also began conservation training at the British Museum. Soon afterwards she began conservation work on the museum objects. She also accompanied Glanville on his 1936 autumn visit to Egypt and attended excavations at El-Amarna and Armant. In 1939 Lafleur became 'Honorary Museum Assistant' and was responsible for photography in the museum, giving six lectures on object conservation. In 1939 Lafleur examined and restored the remains of Jeremy Bentham, along with his clothes, chair and stick. She was responsible for cleaning and preserving his clothes and padding the skeleton so that he could be displayed in the Cloisters of the Wilkins Building at UCL. On the outbreak of the Second World War Lafleur managed the removal of the Petrie Museum collections to Stanstead Bury, near Ware in Hertfordshire. She had only the assistance of the college porters and occasional help from former students for this task. After the UCL campus had been hit by bombs in September 1940 and early 1941, she oversaw a continuous salvage programme for the remaining objects and carried out conservation work in the physiology laboratories. Lafleur packed up the remainder of the collections and sent them to safety during the war, effectively rescuing the museum. She had lost her own flat and most of her belongings during the Blitz in 1940. Lafleur's dedication and work for the museum was recognised in 1951 by Sir David Pye, the Provost, at a Fellows' Dinner where a wish was recorded for a permanent record to her in the Petrie Museum, although no such record was ever made. Lafleur continued preserving the collection when it returned to UCL after the end of the war and continued teaching there until 1954. Rosalind Janssen dedicated her book The First Hundred Years: Egyptology at University College London 1892-1992 to the memory of Violette Lafleur as there was no record of her work in the Petrie Museum. A new exhibition at the Petrie Museum, \"Characters and Collections\", opened summer 2015, now recognizes Lafleur's key role in the survival of the collection."

Between 1946 and 1952 he took various posts in building construction organizations of Saint Petersburg, and then served as a party official in the city, eventually assuming the leading party position of First Secretary (1962–1970). After that he was sent as ambassador to China (1970–1979) and to the Netherlands (1979–1982). Tolstikov had no prior knowledge of foreign languages and diplomacy; besides, he had to start from scratch as there was no Soviet ambassador in China in 1964–1970. Nevertheless, Tolstikov managed to normalize the China-USSR relationship."
