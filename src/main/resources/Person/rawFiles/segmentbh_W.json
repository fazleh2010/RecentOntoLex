  "text" : "William T. O'Higgins (1829-1874) was a Catholic chaplain in the American Civil War. He served in the 10th Ohio Infantry. Born William T. Higgins in 1829 near the border of counties Leitrim and Longford, Ireland, he later took the last name of his uncle (Bishop William O’Higgins (1793-1853)), styled O'Higgins, after the royals. After studying in Maynooth at the Royal College of St. Patrick’s, he was sent to British Guiana in the West Indies. He arrived in Philadelphia on May 23, 1857 and joined the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. From 1860 to 1861, he was the assistant to Rev. Richard Gilmour at St. Patrick's in Cincinnati. After difficulties in Cincinnati, William wrote the Archbishop, John B. Purcell, requesting a position as chaplain; this \"remov[ed him from a thorny personnel situation by responding to an obvious wartime need\". He was commissioned as chaplain of the 10th Ohio Infantry on June 3, 1861, in which he served until June 17, 1864. Following the war, he returned to Cincinnati as a pastor and chaplain, but later left for the Diocese of Little Rock, Arkansas, where he served at the Cathedral of St. Andrew, with a colleague from Ohio, Bishop Edward Fitzgerald. By 1871, he had returned to Ohio, this time to Cleveland, where he taught at St. Mary's Seminary for one term and subsequently served 6 months as pastor of St. Augustine's Church, Cleveland. In 1973 he returned to County Leitrim, Ireland, where he died November 4, 1874."

William Bell's best known works were the portraits painted for the family of Delaval, of Seaton Delaval Hall. These paintings earned Bell the patronage of Lord Delaval, and in 1775 he exhibited two views of Delaval Hall. A portrait he painted of Robert Harrison, 1715-1802, is displayed in the National Portrait Gallery, London. William Bell died on 8 June 1794 and was buried 10 June, St Andrew's Church, Newcastle upon Tyne; his death was reported in the Newcastle Courant (14 June 1794) thus: \"DIED, Sunday morning, Mr William Bell, an eminent Portrait Painter, whose memory will be esteemed at long as his animated productions remain, many of which bear testimony to his abilities in this part of the kingdom\"."

  "text" : "Sir William Beach Thomas, KBE (22 May 1868 – 12 May 1957) was a British author and journalist known for his work as a war correspondent and his writings about nature and country life. Beach Thomas was the son of a rural clergyman. He attended Shrewsbury School and the University of Oxford before embarking on a short-lived career as a schoolmaster. Finding that work unpleasant, he turned his attention to writing articles for newspapers and periodicals, and began to write books. During the early part of the First World War Beach Thomas defied military authorities to report news stories from the Western Front for his employer, the Daily Mail. As a result, he was briefly imprisoned before being granted official accreditation as a war correspondent. His reportage for the remainder of the war received national recognition, despite being criticised by some and parodied by soldiers. His book With the British on the Somme (1917) portrayed the English soldier in a very favourable light. Both France and Britain rewarded him with knighthoods after the war, but Beach Thomas regretted some of his wartime output. Beach Thomas's primary interest as an adult was in rural matters. He was conservative in his views, and feared that the post–Second World War socialist governments regarded the countryside only from an economic perspective. He was an advocate for the creation of national parks in England and Wales, and mourned the decline of traditional village society. He wrote extensively, particularly for The Observer newspaper and The Spectator, a conservative magazine. His book The English Landscape (1938) includes selections from his contributions to Country Life magazine."

  "text" : "Wetti of Reichenau (Latin: Wettinus Augiensis; c 775–824) was a Benedictine monk, scholar and educator at the monastery at Reichenau in modern-day Germany. He was one of the leading educators of his time, and an influential scholar among monks and laity throughout not only the Carolingian empire but also the Western European monastic community. His best known surviving work is his biography of Saint Gallus, the founder of Reichenau's sister monastery, St Gall. Wetti is best known for the visions of heaven and hell he had shortly before his death in about November 4, 824, which were recorded in Latin (Visio Wettini) by Heito, former abbot of Reichenau, in 824 and by Wetti's disciple Walahfrid Strabo in 827. Walahfrid's version, in verse, reveals far more about Wetti's visions than Heito's does, leveling more detailed accusations of greed and sexual misconduct against monks, government and church officials – cautiously edited or omitted by Heito – even acrostically naming Charlemagne when he appears in purgatory. An example of dream literature, the Vision of Wetti reflects Carolingian afterlife conceptions of punishment and salvation; it was widely read throughout contemporary monastic communities and is generally considered one of the influences on Dante's Divine Comedy."

  "text" : "William Donkin (14 November 1911 – 9 August 1969) was a British medical doctor and a disciple of Meher Baba. Donkin was a medical student when he first met Meher Baba in London in 1933. In 1939, after completing medical school, he joined Baba’s men mandali at Meherabad and served Meher Baba for thirty years until his death in 1969. Most notably Donkin traveled with Meher Baba on his mast tours in the 1940s, and wrote a detailed account of these unusual travels in his book The Wayfarers: Meher Baba with the God-Intoxicated, first published in 1948. At the time of its registration, the U.S. Library of Congress described The Wayfarers as \"The most unusual book we have ever received.\" In 1949, at the age of 37, Donkin embarked on a series of spiritual adventures with Meher Baba called the New Life, and was the only western member of the New Life 'companions.' Donkin's life with Meher Baba is chronicled in Donkin's Diaries (2011, Sheriar Foundation) and Slave of Love: The Life of Dr. William Donkin with Meher Baba, by Bob Mossman, (2012, Oceanic Publishing)."

Irwin was born in San Francisco, and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. With the British composer Percy Grainger, Irwin studied composition before joining the Manhattan School of Music in New York City. The musical theatre composer Vernon Duke introduced Irwin to composer and songwriter George Gershwin in the 1920s. Irwin would subsequently join Gershwin and pianist Oscar Levant in piano improvisations at Gershwin's apartment. Irwin began a six-year professional relationship with songwriter and composer Irving Berlin, after being introduced to him by Gershwin. As Berlin could not read or write music Irwin would write down music as Berlin composed, often writing music down for Berlin in the middle of the night. Irwin was professionally engaged as the musical director of touring productions of the musicals Oklahoma!, South Pacific and The King and I in the 1940s. In the 1960s Irwin became the choral director for Manhattan's Radio City Music Hall and later the halls staff composer and musical director. Irwin retired in 1979, and his wife Helen, died in 1984. They had a son, Dean, who was a television producer for ABC News. Irwin had lived in Staten Island for many years before his death in 1998."

The election was held on 29 March, and Cox was elected, coming second of the four candidates, with a majority of 156 votes over the third-placed candidate. When a further general election was called in 1859, Cox found himself opposed by two other Liberal candidates. He lost his seat, with The Standard noting satirically that: \"...the honourable gentleman neither spared his lungs nor his powers of sitting out the most long-winded debate... He had almost arrived at the distinction of being called a bore... Happily for his peace, his health, and his pocket, his too Liberal career has been stopped by an oblivious constituency\". On 13 November 1861 one of the sitting members of parliament for Finsbury, Thomas Slingsby Duncombe, died. On 9 December Cox announced that he would seek election in the resulting by-election. The by-election was held on 16 December, and Cox defeated his only opponent, J R Mills by 42 votes. Cox held the seat until the next general election in July 1865. He was one of four Liberal candidates who, along with a lone Conservative, contested the seat. He failed to be re-elected, finishing in third place with 5,008 votes, more than 2,800 behind the second-placed candidate. Between c.1861 and c.1868 Cox commissioned a house to be built in the village of Netteswell, Essex. The house was called 'Spurriers'. Cox lived in the house until his death in December 1889 aged 72. William Cox is buried in the parish of St Andrew's churchyard, Netteswell, Harlow."

  "text" : "Walter de Brugge, or Walter de Brigge (died 1396) was an English-born clergyman and judge in fourteenth-century Ireland; much of his career was spent in the service of the Earl of March. He is mainly remembered now as the first person who is known to have owned a copy of the celebrated poem Piers Plowman. Both versions of his family name are early forms of Brydges, so he may have been connected to the Brydges family of Coberley in Gloucestershire which held the title Baron Chandos from about 1337, and who at that time usually spelt their name Brugge. He was already \"connected with Ireland\" in 1369, and was guardian of the Irish estates of Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March. He spent much of his career in the service of the Mortimer family, and is said to have spent much of his time in constant travel between the various Mortimer estates \"shipping cash and auditing accounts\". In the political crisis of 1387, where the 2nd Earl's natural son Sir Thomas Mortimer worked with the powerful faction of the nobility called the Lords Appellant to defeat King Richard II, it has been suggested that Brugge, who was constantly \"on the move\", served as a useful go-between. As a clergyman he was accused of corruption, and he was certainly guilty of pluralism, being Archdeacon of Meath, Archdeacon of Kells, vicar of Burwell, Cambridgeshire, and of St. Patrick's Church, Trim, and prebendary of York, Hereford, St. David's and St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He attempted to become chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, but was opposed by John de Karlell, a fellow Baron of the Exchequer. A petition from Brugge to the King dating from about 1377 survives, asking for the King to examine the evidence so that justice might be done to him in the dispute. In spite of his pleas the office went to Karlell.Brugge became a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1381, and died in 1396. He is said to have possessed a considerable library, and he is the first person known to have owned a copy of the famous medieval poem Piers Plowman, by William Langland. This is somewhat ironic since the \"false priest in Ireland\" whom the poet denounces for corruption has recently been identified as none other than de Brugge himself: but even if de Brugge understood the reference as being to himself it does not seem to have prevented him from enjoying the poem."

  "text" : "Willie Wolf Wind (1913-October 11, 1995) was a graphic artist and graphic designer whose work is on display in Israel, Illinois, and Florida. Born in Berlin, Germany, he showed a talent for art as a child and studied art in school. After Kristallnacht (November 9–10, 1938), Willie fled from Nazi Germany to the British Mandate of Palestine, while his brothers Edward and Julius fled to the United States, his brother Hy to Shanghai, China. All later moved to the US. Another sister, Shoshana, also fled to Palestine. Willie's younger sister, Margot Wind, stayed in Germany with her parents Jacob and Sima Wind. All three were forcibly deported to Tarnów, Poland in 1939. On June 10, 1942, Margot came home to an empty apartment, her parents apparently taken by the Nazis. Soon thereafter, she married Charles \"Chaskel\" Schlesinger, 10 years her senior. Through a series of she called \"miracles,\" she and her husband were both rescued by Oskar Schindler. Margot is incorrectly listed as \"Hania Schlesinger\" on List 2, Line 233, and Chaskel is listed by his Hebrew name, \"Abraham Schlesinger\" on List 1, Line 37 on Schindler's List. After traveling safely to France after World War II, they emigrated to the United States. In Palestine, he joined the Palmach and pursued his art career. In 1948, he won a design competition for the new State of Israel's coat of arms, the Emblem of Israel. Israel's Knesset eventually adopted a modified version of Wind's design. He also designed among the first postage stamps for United Nations  and many stamps for Israel, including a 1951 Jewish National Fund 80Pr Tab Strip . After migrating to Chicago, Illinois, USA, in 1954 to join his three brothers Edward, Hy (Chaim), and Julius, and his sister Margot, he designed commemorative stamps for newly independent Ghana and Togo and stained-glass windows for synagogues in Chicago  and Coconut Creek, Florida. Over the next 40 years, he worked on a variety of artistic and creative projects, both commercial and religious, in Israel and the United States. He co-founded Creative Design Board, which he eventually sold to Foster & Kleiser, a major designer of corporate artwork and billboards, now owner by Clear Channel Outdoors. He was married to Pnina (Schwartzbard) Wind (b. 1914), who herself lost six sisters in the Holocaust. They had one daughter, Gail (Yael) Wind Schneiderman. Both live in the near north suburbs of Chicago."

  "text" : "A noted and established Scottish Artist and Professor of Art, Will Maclean was born in Inverness in 1941. He was a midshipman (1957–59) before attending Gray's School of Art, Aberdeen (1961–65) and then the British School at Rome in 1966 as part of a year on a Gray's Travelling Scholarship. He spent another period of time at sea in 1968 as a ring-net fisherman, which led to a major bursary in 1973 to study ring-net herring fishing. The resulting Ring-Net Project, a body of over 400 drawings, was exhibited at the Third Eye Centre, Glasgow, from where it toured, and in 1986 at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, where it entered the permanent collection. In 1981 he was appointed lecturer at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, University of Dundee, where he remained for fifteen fruitful years, becoming Professor of Fine Art in 1994 and in 2004-2006, Senior Research Fellow and now Emeritus Professor. He was elected Royal Scottish Academician in 1991 and in 1997 he designed and as part of the team, won the Scottish Natural Heritage Supreme Award for three Memorial Cairns in Lewis. In 1999 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of St Andrews, winning the Scottish Arts Council Creative Scotland Award in the same year. The British Library and Tate Artists Lives Sound Archive made a valuable recorded interview with him in 2005, the year he was awarded an MBE for services to Education and the Arts. He lives and works in Tayport, Fife with his wife, the artist Marian Leven. Maclean has exhibited widely since 1967. Solo exhibitions have included The Ring-Net, Third Eye Centre, Glasgow and tour (1978); Runkel-Hue-Williams, London (1990); Retrospective Exhibition, Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh and tour (1992) with accompanying monograph Symbols of Survival; a major solo show, Driftworks at Dundee Contemporary Arts, 2001, and exhibitions with Art First, London, since 1994. His most recent exhibition being the 2011 show \"Lead and Line\" - at Art First's gallery in Eastcastle Street, London W1In 1999 his exhibition Cardinal Points was hosted by the Museum of North Dakota, Grand Forks, North Dakota USA before touring to Canada to McMaster Museum of Art, Hamilton, Ontario, and Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador, St. Johns. Group exhibitions include Worlds in a Box, Edinburgh City Art Centre and The Whitechapel Gallery, London (1994 95); and Contemporary British Art in Print, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh (1995) which featured A Night of Islands, a set of ten etchings published in 1991. A major work was acquired for the new Scottish Parliament building and commissioned sculptures and collaborative works can be seen in Skye, Lewis and elsewhere in Scotland. Recent sculptural commissions include the piece \"Waterlines\" (commissioned by the University of Aberdeen and installed in the square facing the new library there) and the Suileachan Project on the Isle of Lewis (winner of the The Saltire Arts and Crafts in Architecture Award 2013), both collaborations with Marian Leven. The critic and writer Duncan Macmillan writes in his introduction to the monograph on Maclean - 'Symbols of Survival': Will Maclean is one of the outstanding artists of his generation in Scotland... his art is rooted in his knowledge of the highlands, the Highland people and their history and in his own early associations with sailors and the sea. This makes it relevant and immediately accessible, yet it remains uncompromisingly modern in its forms and concernsHis work is in public collections including Arts Council of Great Britain; The British Museum; Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow City Art Galleries; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge; Scottish Arts Council; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art; Royal Scottish Academy of Art & Architecture;McMaster Museum, Canada; Yale Centre for British Art, Newhaven, USA."

Born in Maidstone, Kent, Hammond was a batsman of unknown handedness who debuted at Lord's in July 1855 with two single-figure scores against a Gentleman of England XI. He represented the Gentlemen of Kent and Surrey again in August that same year, making two scores of seven. He then went on to make his only appearance for Kent in June 1857 where he made his career best score of 17 against Surrey. Despite this modest first-class record, Hammond enjoyed a substantial career in club cricket, playing for clubs in Maidstone before emigration to the United States in 1859 led to him representing Germantown, an English Resident's XI, the Philadelphian cricket team, the Boston cricket club and the fledgling United States cricket team. He died in Brooklyn, New York City."

  "text" : "Walter Edwin Gilbert (March 8, 1899 – June 18, 1986) was a Canadian bush pilot and one of the founders of Pacific Western Airlines. Gilbert was born in Cornwall, Ontario. His father worked dredging the Saint Lawrence River. Father and son travelled to Lakeside near Montreal in 1910 to observe an airshow. In World War I, Gilbert joined the Royal Flying Corps, Toronto. He saw little air combat and returned to Canada to work in the Saint Lawrence.In 1921 he was a civilian flyer for the Canadian Air Force in British Columbia. In 1927 he flew forest patrols for the Forest Service. Gilbert landed a regular position with Western Canada Airways in 1928. He was posted to Cranberry Portage, Manitoba as service was in demand for a nearby Sherritt Gordon mine.Settlements along the MacKenzie River were delivered their mail by air. Punch Dickins introduced Gilbert to the run from Fort McMurray to Aklavik. In 1939 Gilbert’s experiences on this route were recorded in Arctic Pilot. In 1930 Gilbert took Major L. T. Burwash on a search for Franklin's lost expedition. Their aerial photographs of the Beaufort Sea were much appreciated by navigators and geographers. Gilbert became a member of The Explorers Club, a fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society and of the Royal Geographical Society. For his service to Canadian aviation he was awarded the McKee Trophy in 1933. Charles Lindbergh piloting his Lockheed Sirius was in Aklavik in August 1931 and needed assistance getting aloft. As Morton reports Gilbert in 'SK taxied ahead of them to create waves on the surface and to let the slipstream from his propeller assist the heavily loaded Lockheed Sirius get up on his step. In 1939, as regional operations chief for Western Canada Airways, Gilbert directed Russ Baker to Fort St. John, British Columbia, near Pinchi Lake where service was needed to fly mercury. The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Limited was supplying the increased demands brought on by war. The mine manager Emil Bronlund supplied Baker 400 flasks of mercury, 75 pounds each, in June 1940 to fly out. After the war Baker and Gilbert started Central British Columbia Airlines with financing from Karl John Springer. The company was incorporated July 8, 1945 and for a while Gilbert was President. He and Baker stayed at Devonshire Hotel in Vancouver when the north country was undergoing freeze-up and spring break-up. Over-expenditures were repaid by Baker, but Gilbert balked and was fired by Springer in June 1947. From Chilliwack Gilbert provided crop dusting service. Later he moved to Point Roberts and became an American. He died June 18, 1986."

  "text" : "Wei Sijiong (Chinese: 魏斯炅, Pinyin: Wèi Sījiǒng, Wade–Giles: Wei Ssu-chiung, 1873-1922), courtesy name (zi) Fuou (T: 阜歐, S: 阜欧, P: Fùōu, W: Fu-ou) was a former head of the Jiangxi Province Bureau of Civil Affairs, and a member of the National Assembly of the Republic of China. His name is often falsely stated to be Siling (T: 斯靈, S: 斯灵, P: Sīlíng, W: Ssu-ling). Wei, from Jiangxi, studied economics in Japan during the beginning of the 20th Century and he was involved in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. When he met Sai Jinhua, he was the head of Jiangxi Province's tax authority. On 20 June 1918 he and Sai Jinhua married in Shanghai. Sai Jinhua adopted the art name (hao) Weizhao Lingfei, a combination of her family name with that of her husband. She did this to show her devotion to him. The couple moved to Beijing. Wei Sijiong died shortly after Sai Jinhua's mother's 1922 death, and his family refused to allow Sai Jinhua to share his property."

Constellation (CVA-64) and his Task Force saw action in Vietnam and was involved in the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in August 1964. Guest and all those that served with him received the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (Which, later was allowed to be exchanged for the Vietnam Service Medal) for action in the war zone of the South China Seas. In 1966 Guest was commander of Task Force 65 of the United States Sixth Fleet when a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber collided with a tanker and crashed near Palomares, Spain. It was carrying four thermonuclear weapons, one of which fell into the Mediterranean Sea. Guest deployed and commanded an 18-vessel US Navy task force, helped by civilian-operated submersibles Aluminaut and Alvin which eventually found the bomb, which was recovered intact. Guest was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal."

  "text" : "William Pollack (February 26, 1926 – November 3, 2013) was a British-born American immunologist who developed the Rho(D) immune globulin vaccine against Rh disease, a leading cause of erythroblastosis fetalis. Pollack co-developed the vaccine, also known by the RhoGAM brand name, which is given to pregnant women to prevent Rh disease, with Dr. Vincent Freda and Dr. John G. Gorman of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Pollack's vaccine, introduced in 1968, virtually eliminated cases of Rh disease in developed countries. Prior to the RhoGAM vaccine, Rh disease was responsible for approximately 10,000 infant deaths in the United States annually. The development of the RhoGAM vaccine has been called one of the ten greatest medical breakthroughs of the 20th Century. Pollack, Freda and Gorman were awarded the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award for their achievement in 1980. Pollack was born in London on February 26, 1926, to David and Rose Pollack. He served in the Royal Navy during World War II. He enrolled at Imperial College, London after the war, earning a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1948. In 1950, Pollack received a master's degree from St. George's Hospital Medical School. He then worked in the pathology department at St. George's from 1948 to 1954. Pollack moved to British Columbia, Canada, in 1954 to become a director of a blood bank and clinical laboratory. In 1956, he moved, this time to Raritan, New Jersey, where he joined the staff of Ortho Pharmaceutical, where he began his research on his Rh disease vaccine. He would eventually become Ortho Pharmaceutical's Vice President and Director of Research. Pollack obtained a doctorate in zoology at Rutgers University while researching Rh disease at Ortho. Pollack later taught immunology at Rutgers University and Columbia University. Dr. William Pollock died from complications of diabetes and heart disease on November 3, 2013, in Yorba Linda, California, at the age of 87. He was survived by his sons, Malcolm and David, and predeceased by his wife, Alison Calder, who died in 2006."

  "text" : "Walter L. Lee, Sr. (September 9, 1921 – April 12, 2015) was from 1956 to 2012 the clerk of the 13th Judicial District Court in Evangeline Parish in south Louisiana. Until his defeat for a fifteenth term in the nonpartisan blanket primary in October 2011, Lee had encountered virtually no substantive opponents over the fifty-six years in his position. Upon his election, Lee was sworn into office as clerk of court on June 7, 1956, by his predecessor, Richard Kenneth Reed (1917-1999), a real estate businessman from Mamou, who held the position for the preceding eight years. A Democrat, Lee in 2011 received 21 percent of the ballots cast, a third-place finish in his last primary election for clerk of court. He had just turned ninety years of age at the time of that election. Instead the Democrat Randall M. Deshotel and a Republican, Ben Soileau, advanced to the general election held on November 19. Deshotel then defeated Soileau, 52-48 percent, to claim the right to succeed Lee. In defense of the reelection that eluded him in 2011, Lee said that his office, based in the parish seat of Ville Platte, \"is rated one of the best run offices in the state. This office is completely computerized, and I have a staff of employees who are all professional. As the old saying goes, don’t fix something that is not broken; and this office is certainly not broken.\" In his last term, Lee experienced a series of strokes and consequently used a wheelchair for mobility. Lee served in the United States Navy in the South Pacific during World War II. In the Navy, he lived in his own apartment in San Diego, California. He made his own violin out of a cigar box and taught himself how to play the Cajun fiddle. He played with the Balfa brothers. Lee formerly served on the board of directors of the Federal Land Bank and the Louisiana Clerks of Court Association. Because of his longevity in office, he was inducted in 2009 into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. He is thus far the only clerk of court in Louisiana history to have received this designation. Lee and his late wife, Florence, had three children, Walter, Jr., and wife, Judge Judy Fuller, of Lafayette; Mike Lee and wife, Sue, of Point Blue in Evangeline Parish, and Nona Lee, who predeceased her father. Lee is interred in the Sacred Heart Catholic Mausoleum in Ville Platte. Lee should not be confused with Walter C. Lee (born October 1934), a Shreveport Republican and former member of the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. This Walter Lee is also a former school superintendent in both Caddo and DeSoto parishes in northwestern Louisiana."

From 1871 to 1877 he held the office of Director of Supplies and Transports. Drake was nominated a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1856, after the conclusion of the Russian war, and was advanced to a Knight Commander of that Order, in 1871.Drake was twice married, first, in 1834, to Louisa, daughter of Mr. James Purkis, and secondly, in 1862, to Elizabeth Lucy, daughter of the Hon.

Elected as a Republican in 1921 to represent the 21st Assembly District of Flatbush in the New York State Assembly, Clayton continued on as a member of that body for an additional four more years, sitting in the 144th, 145th, 146th, 147th, and 148th New York State Legislatures. Clayton was made the chairman of the Cities Committee in his final year of political office, as well as a member of the Rules Committee. Clayton was a conservative politician. As the founder of the New York State Motion Picture Censorship Commission, one of the more controversial pieces of legislation that he passed was a motion picture censorship bill in 1923. Clayton was a respected legislator who, after serving in the Assembly for five years, returned to his building business in 1925."

  "text" : "(For the Canadian member of Parliament, see William Goodison.) William Goodison (alternatively Goodisson) (1785–1836) was an assistant surgeon of the British Army. He was born in 1785 in the county of Wicklow, Ireland. His father, William Goodison, was a pharmacist and urged his son to study under professor Austin of Trinity College, Dublin. William Goodison entered Trinity College at the age of 16, in 1801, and concluded his studies in the spring of 1807 by obtaining a B.A. (Bachelor of Arts). He ranked the Medical Service of the British Army on 23 August 1810. He was placed an assistant surgeon of the 75th Regiment of Foot (also known as the Abercromby or the Highland Regiment), a position previously held by John Cumine. He served this post until 4 March 1824, when he was reduced on half-pay and moved to the 25th Regiment of Light Dragoons, until his death in August 1836. The 75th Regiment of Foot was posted, during the Napoleonic Wars, to the Ionian Islands and arrived in Corfu on 14 July 1814, after the de facto occupation of the island by the British. William Goodison, then a young assistant surgeon under George Treyer, served in Melikia, a village near Lefkimmi in southern Corfu-island, and studied, on the field, the symptoms of the remittent fever and the plague which struck the region. The epidemic had appeared in Malta in 1814 and was transferred to the Ionian Islands in 1815 and 1816. Goodison published the results of his observations in an article, which appeared in the medical periodical Dublin Hospital Reports in 1817. After the elimination of the plague epidemic in Corfu, the 75th Regiment of Foot moved, in August 1817, to the island of Lefkas, where it stayed until the end of 1820. From Lefkas, Goodison travelled to other Ionian islands, like Meganisi, Ithaca, Cephalonia and Zante. The Regiment returned to Corfu on the last days of 1820, and stayed there until August 1821. Their next base was Gibraltar from where they returned to England at the end of 1823. During his service in Corfu and the Ionian Isles, Goodison took advantage of his stay there and compared the topography of these islands against the descriptions of Homer's Odyssey and other texts of ancient and modern writers. The outcome was a Historical and Topographical Essay upon the Islands of Corfù, Leucadia, Cephalonia, Ithaca, and Zante: with Remarks upon the Character, Manners, and Customs of the Ionian Greeks, which he composed during his stay in the islands and concluded writing in Gibraltar, where the regiment moved in August 1821. The book was published in October 1822, in London, by Thomas and George Underwood, and was welcomed with extensive reviews, published in the following years."

He attended the council at Savonnières in 859, and was one of the judges in the case of treason brought against Wenilo, archbishop of Sens. He also attended the councils held at Aachen in 859 and 861 to deal with the divorce of King Lothair II and Teutberga. In 860, Wenilo was forced to flee Rouen in the face of Viking attacks and take refuge in Andely, where he owned a property. He was present at the council of Pîtres in 864, where Charles the Bald gave his famous decree concerning the defence of the realm against the Vikings. Archbishop Hincmar of Reims wrote him a letter concerning the construction of a fortified bridge over the Seine at Pîtres. Wenilo attended the church council at Soissons on 18 August 866. His influence, along with that of Gombert of Évreux and Pardulus of Laon, gained for the abbey of La Croix-Saint-Leufroy in the Drouais many royal gifts before 858. Between 858 and 862 he also got donations for Thiverny in the Beauvaisis so that it could serve as a refuge for monks."

  "text" : "William Reginald Morse (30 August 1874 – 11 November 1939) was a Canadian author, medical doctor, and medical missionary in China. In 1901 he proceeded to West China where he founded West China Union University. The university was one of the first co-educational medical schools in China that provided western education. Morse also made substantial contributions to the fields of anthropology and medical history through his published works. Morse provided historical insight to the West on the traditional practices of Chinese and Tibetan Medicine. Morse specifically delineated the influence of religion and culture in the evolution of medicine in East Asia. Additionally, Morse wrote several anthropological books that outlined the physical and physiological behavior of the people of Szechwan and Tibet. Morse was interested not only in understanding the vast differences in culture between China and the West, but also communicating these differences to the West."

Fletcher was educated at Silcoats School in Yorkshire, the University of Bonn, the Lancashire Independent College and Owens College (now Victoria University), Manchester. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from London University in 1853 and in the following year received the London University prize for the scripture examination. In 1856 he graduated Master of Arts and won the gold medal. He soon sailed for Sydney and ultimately went to Victoria where he acted as his father's assistant in St Kilda and Sandhurst (now Bendigo). In 1866 he removed to the Richmond suburb of Melbourne and was appointed a professor at the Congregational College of Victoria. After a tour around the world he became the minister of Stow Memorial Church in Adelaide in March 1876, and filled that position with marked success until 1890, when he resigned to undertake further travel. From 1878 he was a member of the council of the University of Adelaide, of which he was made an honorary M.A. in 1877. During the last illness, and subsequent to the death of the late Professor Davidson, he was the acting Hughes Professor of English Language and Literature and Mental and Moral Philosophy. In 1890 he was elected vice-chancellor of the university."

Foster was born in Rathescar, County Louth, Ireland, the son of Rev. William Henry Foster of Loughgilly, County Armagh, and his wife Catherine, née Hamilton. Foster was educated at Cheltenham College, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he took the Vice-Chancellor's prize for Greek in 1850, also the composition prize in the same year, as well as honours in classics and mathematics. He left the University in 1851. Foster arrived in Sydney in August 1854, and for the first three years of his residence in New South Wales devoted himself to agricultural pursuits. He then studied law, and was called to the colonial bar in 1858, when he entered on the practice of his profession. In 1859 he published a work on the District Courts Act, which was the standard work on the subject until 1870, when a revised edition was issued. In 1877 be published a supplement to the same work. He acted as a Crown prosecutor from 1859 to 1862 and from 1864 to 1870, when he was appointed Crown Prosecutor for Sydney, in succession to Mr. Butler, who had accepted the Attorney-Generalship. In December 1877 Foster resigned as Crown Prosecutor, and became Attorney-General in the Farnell Administration, with a seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council. Retiring with his colleagues in December 1878, he again took office in October 1881, being Minister of Justice in the Parkes Administration from that date till Jan. 1883, when the Government resigned. He retired from the Legislative Council in 1880, and was returned to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Newtown. In 1882 he was defeated, but was re-elected in 1885, and sat in the Assembly till he retired from political life in 1888. Judge Foster was made Q.C. in 1886, and in the following January he again took office as Attorney-General under Sir Henry Parkes, but resigned in February 1888, on the ground that his prior claim to the vacant Puisne Judgship had been slighted. Later in the same year he was raised to the Supreme Court Bench. Mr. Justice Foster married in 1854 Matilda Sophia, daughter of John Williams, of Landigige, Pembrokeshire. He on several occasions refused District Court Judgeships, and declined the Speakership of the Assembly in 1887. Foster died in Valley Heights, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia on 16 August 1909."

Gray decided to emigrate to Victoria (Australia), and with Charles Gavan Duffy, sailed in the Ocean Chief arriving in Melbourne in 1856. Gray took an active part in the solution of the land question on liberal lines, and was one of the founders of the Victoria Land League, under whose auspices was summoned a great assemblage of delegates from all parts of Victoria to discuss the land question with a view to promoting the settlement of a farming population on the public estate. The Land Convention, as it was called, met in Melbourne in 1857, and condemned the abortive Haines Land Bill then passing through the Lower House. Wilson Gray was elected the president of the Convention, which also passed resolutions in favour of manhood suffrage, equal electoral districts, abolition of property qualification, and payment of representatives. Gray was member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Rodney from January 1860 to September 1862, when he went to Otago, New Zealand, and became a district court judge. He died in Lawrence, Otago, New Zealand on 4 April 1875."

  "text" : "Darrell Wayne Perry (died May 15, 2005) was a country music singer and songwriter. Perry started his music career in the Cincinnati, Ohio, area in the early 1970s, where he recorded several songs on the Beast Records label before moving to Nashville, Tennessee. His song credits include \"Not a Moment Too Soon,\" recorded by Tim McGraw; \"A Woman's Touch,\" recorded by Toby Keith in 1996; \"I Only Miss You,\" featured in the 1996 movie The Evening Star; and \"Every Promise I Ever Made,\" featured in the 2002 movie Desert Saints. He co-wrote \"What Part of No,\" which was a number-one hit for Lorrie Morgan. Late in his career he added pop music to his repertoire, writing songs for performers such as the Backstreet Boys. Wayne Perry died from throat cancer in 2005, at age 55. The cancer was diagnosed in December 2002. Perry's sister, evangelical preacher Darlene Bishop, persuaded him not to undergo recommended medical treatment, but instead to seek healing through prayer, which she said she had used to overcome breast cancer. Perry accepted her advice and moved from his home in Waverly, Tennessee (near Nashville) to live with his sister at her horse farm in Monroe, Ohio. Bishop wrote a book, Your Life Follows Your Words, that described herself and her brother's success in healing cancer through their Christian faith. Perry, however, was advised in 2004 that his cancer had become terminal, and died in Monroe the following year. Subsequently, his four children sued Bishop. In the lawsuits, they charged Bishop with wrongdoing in Perry's death, sought to remove her as executor of his estate, and sought ownership of the rights to Perry's music, including many unrecorded songs. Bishop said that the allegations against her were false. However, in a deposition in the case, she revealed that she had never been medically diagnosed with breast cancer; she said she thought she had the disease and later was cured. The wrongful death lawsuit was later dropped. The litigation over Perry's estate was settled in 2010, placing Perry's music in trust for his children. The legal battle over Perry's estate was the subject of a 2011 episode of the Investigation Discovery television series The Will: Family Secrets Revealed, entitled \"The Estate of Wayne Perry.\""

In 1856 he became an assistant at the Hofmineraliencabinett, where soon afterwards, he succeeded Gustav Adolf Kenngott as \"kustos-adjunkt\". In 1857 he became an associate professor of higher physics at the university, and in 1859, was chosen as a member of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. He died in Vienna on 13 September 1859, at the age of 30. In 1910, a thoroughfare in the Landstrasse district of Vienna was named Grailichgasse in his honor. Known for his work in crystal optics and crystal physics, he was the author of numerous scientific papers in the field of crystallography. In 1856, he translated William Hallowes Miller's textbook of crystallography into German as \"Lehrbuch der Kristallographie\". He explained the phenomenon of fluorescence in crystals, and is credited for making improvements to Wheatstone's vibration apparatus (in German: \"Schwingungsapparat\")."

He attended Bedford School and in 1908 he emigrated to Canada and spent three years working as a ranch hand, sketching and photographing wildlife in his spare time, before returning to England and enrolling at University College London. His studies were briefly interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914: he joined the London Scottish Rifles, but saw no active service and was discharged on medical grounds in 1915. He graduated in 1917 and after further study gained an MSc in 1919. After a brief spell as a school teacher in England, he was appointed as a lecturer in Zoology at the University of Manitoba in 1919, where he was a founder member of the Natural History Society of Manitoba. He moved to Edmonton in 1920 to found the department of Zoology at the University of Alberta, heading the department until his retirement in 1956. In 1924, Rowan began experimenting with the effects of daylight on bird migration. It was generally thought that migration was probably initiated by variations in temperature or barometric pressure. He trapped a number of dark-eyed juncos, which he kept caged, and lengthened the hours of daylight to which they were exposed. This produced spring behaviour in the birds during the middle of winter. This work earned Rowan a doctorate from University College London, but a direct link to migration remained to be established: the seasonally disturbed birds appeared ready to fly northwards in spite of the fact that it was still winter; however, it remained to be established where they went after their release. Rowan then carried out the now-legendary experiment that established his reputation. In the autumn of 1931, 500 crows were confined in cages on the south bank of the North Saskatchewan River. The crows were divided into two equally sized groups: an experimental group subjected to artificial light that gradually shortened their nights; and a control group, which experienced natural seasonal reductions in daylight hours. Rowan released the crows in November, after their tails were dyed yellow for purposes of identification. Their release was accompanied by a radio and press campaign offering rewards for every yellow-tailed crow caught or shot. As a result, Rowan was able to account for more than half of the birds. More crows from the control group were accounted for, as they tended either to remain near to the site of their release or to fly south; those from the experimental group behaved as they would in spring, flying north. This identification of the cause of migratory behaviour provided Rowan with international standing as a scientist. Rowan died in Edmonton on 30 June 1957."

In the 1650s, as a Rittmeister (\"captain\") under Karl X Gustav, he took part in a campaign against Denmark. In the time when Karl XI was under age, Wrangel was a direct employee of the royal house. In 1665 he was appointed colonel in a regiment of horse, with which he participated in a campaign against Bremen. In 1667 he was promoted major general. In the Swedish-Brandenburg War in 1674 he served as a lieutenant general together with his step-brother, who had been Reichsmarschall since 1664. In this war, Wolmar Wrangel was the third highest-ranking officer after the Reichsmarschall and Field Marshal Conrad Mardefelt. Because both the Reichsmarschall and Conrad Mardefelt could not discharge their responsibility on account of ill health, Wolmar Wrangel was de facto the commander-in-chief of the Swedish Army which was defeated in 1675 at the Battle of Fehrbellin."

  "text" : "Walter Julius Veith (born 1949) is a South African zoologist and a Seventh-day Adventist author and speaker known for his work in nutrition, creationism and Biblical exegesis with the Amazing Discoveries media ministry and on their international television network found in North America on Galaxy 19. Veith was professor of the zoology department at the University of Cape Town and taught in the medical bioscience department. During this time the department was awarded a Royal Society London grant for zoological research. After joining the Seventh-day Adventist Church he rejected the theory of evolution in favor of creationism and so had to give up teaching at the University of Cape Town. As a creationist he speaks internationally on this and other topics. His lectures, videos, and books promote creationist and Adventist beliefs and doctrines. These include an evangelical understanding of the Bible with a very strong commitment to the Textus Receptus and the King James Version of the Bible but not a 'KJV Only' position, He also promotes a vegan diet and a belief in the imminent fulfillment of Biblical End Times and the return of Jesus Christ. Veith has written a number of books, including Diet and Health and The Genesis Conflict, which gives a biblical perspective and evidence claimed to support young earth creationism. He is the keynote speaker of Amazing Discoveries, a non-profit worldwide ministry based in British Columbia, Canada. Amazing Discoveries conducts seminars and streams by satellite, 24 hours a day, seven days a week on TV and satellite across North America and the world."

He married Ada Mary Wright in 1895, and in 1896 published The Balkans, followed in 1898 by Travels and Politics in the Near East. In 1903 he and his wife left England for Italy, and despite an effort by Ronald Burrows to recruit Miller as the first incumbent of the Chair of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language, and Literature at London University, he and his wife spent the rest of their lives abroad. They lived in Rome until 1923, when Miller found Benito Mussolini's rise to power distasteful, and they moved to Athens. There he was associated with the British School at Athens until the German invasion of Greece in 1941. Together the couple lived in South Africa for the rest of their lives, Ada Mary surviving him by four years. They had no children. His important publications include: \n*  The Balkans (1896) \n*  Travels and Politics in the Near East (1898) \n*  Greek Life in Town and Country (1905) \n*  The Latins in the Levant (1908) \n*  The Ottoman Empire and its Successors (1913) \n*  Essays on the Latin Orient (1921) \n*  History of the Greek People (1821-1921) (1922) \n*  Trebizond the Last Greek Empire (1926)"

  "text" : "William Farrer Ecroyd (14 July 1827 – 9 November 1915) was an English politician. Ecroyd was born into a Quaker family and joined the family firm, his father being a Lancashire mill owner. He was widely known as an unselfish employer. Reading the works of theologians, Ecroyd abandoned Quakerism for Anglicanism after his father's death, and abandoned the traditional family Liberalism for Conservatism. He stood unsuccessfully Carlisle in the 1874 general election. As a young man he had been a member of the Anti-Corn Law League and was widely read in political economy. However, in the late 1870s his firm began to greatly suffer from foreign imports. In 1879 he published a pamphlet, The Policy of Self-Help, arguing that if Britain imposed import duties on wheat and manufactured goods, this would give her the leverage to negotiate with other countries in order to secure reciprocal free trade. Free imports from the colonies would also strengthen the cause of imperial federation and prevent Britain's decline into a third-rate power. Att he 1880 general election Ecroyd stood for North East Lancashire on this platform, denounced by his opponent Lord Hartington as \"Ecroydism\". Ecroyd won the Preston by-election, 1881 on a fair trade platform. He stood down at the 1885 election due to ill health, however Lord Salisbury appointed him to the Royal Commission on the Depression in Trade and Industry, an outlet for his fair trade views. With over fifty years service at his firm, Ecroyd retired in 1896. His retirement address (A Few Words to the Workers at Lomeshaye Mills) was on the duties of employers, with the factory viewed more as a venue for moral training than for accruing profits. In retirement he praised Joseph Chamberlain's agitation for Tariff Reform and possibly wrote several Tariff Reform pamphlets."

  "text" : "Winfield Scott Sims (April 6, 1844 – January 7, 1918) was an American inventor. Sims was born in New York City, son of Lindsay D. and Catherine B. Sims. Sims attended the public schools of Newark, New Jersey. He had just graduated from the high school when the American Civil War broke out. He enlisted in the 37th Regiment New Jersey Volunteers and served until 1864. Sims has specialized in the application of electric power to marine vehicles and in the invention of high power war weapons. He was the first to apply electricity to the propulsion of torpedoes. Among his inventions is a submarine boat with a cylindrical hull of copper having conical ends and with a screw propeller and rudder operated by electric power generated on shore or on ship board, by means of which the torpedo is propelled, guided and exploded. Among Sims’ earlier inventions were various devices in electromagnets and the construction of an electric motor, weighing 45 pounds for light work, with a battery of twenty half gallon Bensen cells that propelled an open boat sixteen feet long with six persons on it, at the rate of four miles an hour. His invention of the submarine torpedo boat was followed by the devising of a boat with a speed of 22 miles an hour to carry a 500 pound charge of dynamite. He invented also a wireless dirigible torpedo for the Japanese Government in 1907. The Sims-Dudley dynamite gun, also of his invention, was used by the Cuban insurgents, and, at the battle of Santiago by the “Rough Riders.” Others of his designs are a dynamite gun for use with dirigible war ships and an aeroplane dynamite gun. Sims was president of the New York Ordnance Company. He died in Newark in 1918."

  "text" : "William Paynel (sometimes William Paganel; died around 1146) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and baron. Paynel was the son of Ralph Paynel, who was a tenant-in-chief listed in Domesday Book with lands in Yorkshire. Ralph also held Middle Rasen in Lincolnshire as well as lands in Normandy – Les Moutiers-Hubert in the Calvados region and Hambye in the Manche region. Besides William, Ralph was the father of Jordan and Alexander. Jordan died before their father and without heirs. Ralph died by 1124, at which time William Paynel, the eldest surviving son, inherited his father's lands including those at Drax in Yorkshire. Other lands held by Ralph and William were Hooton Pagnell also in Yorkshire. The lands at Drax, combined with those at Hooton Pagnell, are considered a barony under the name of Hooton Pagnell, and passed to William from his father. In September 1136, Paynel's castle at Les Moutiers-Hubert was attacked by Count Geoffrey of Anjou, husband of Empress Matilda. Matilda was the only surviving legitimate child of King Henry I of England, but at Henry's death in 1135, her cousin Stephen of Blois had seized the throne of England and secured Normandy as well. In 1136 Matilda and her husband contested Stephen's seizure of both England and Normandy, starting a civil war usually known as The Anarchy that lasted most of Stephen's reign from 1135 to 1154. By 1140, Paynel was a supporter of the Empress Matilda's efforts to gain the throne of England. In late 1140 he was named Matilda's castellan for Nottingham Castle, which had just been captured by Matilda's half-brother Robert of Gloucester. At the end of Lent in 1142 William Peverel seized the castle for the king's forces while Paynel was absent visiting the Empress. After Paynel's death, his sons were also supporters of the Empress, and lost control of Drax for this support, but by 1154 Hugh and Fulk split some of the English and Norman lands between themselves. Paynel founded two religious houses – the priory at Drax in the 1130s and an abbey at Hambye in Normandy around 1145. Drax was a house of Augustinian canons. Besides his foundations, Paynel also gave gifts to Selby Abbey, Holy Trinity Priory in York, and the Abbey of St Etienne in Caen. Paynel died around 1145 to 1147. Paynel married twice. His first wife was a daughter of William fitzWimund. His second wife was Avice, the widow of William de Courcy and daughter of William Meschin. By his first wife, Paynel had four sons – Hugh, Fulk, Thomas and John. A daughter named Gertrude may possibly also be from this first marriage. The second marriage produced a daughter, Alice, who was Paynel's principal heiress. Hugh and Fulk received small portions of lands in England and also Paynel's lands in Normandy. Hambye in the Cotenin went to Fulk and Les Moutiers-Hubert went to Hugh. Alice received the lands at Drax and Hooton Pagnell, and married twice, first to Richard de Courcy and second to Robert de Gant."

  "text" : "William Williams (6 March 1808 – 26 September 1872), known by his bardic name, Carw Coch (literally Red Stag), was a prominent literary figure in Aberdare, and south Wales generally, during the mid-nineteenth century, and an important figure in the development of the eisteddfod movement. His bardic name was derived from the Stag Inn, the public house that he ran at Trecynon, Aberdare. Williams was born on 6 March 1808 near Aberpergwm in the Vale of Neath, the son of Noah and Joan Williams, who attended the Unitarian chapel at Blaengwrach. At a young age he moved to Tredegar, and later to Llwydcoed, Aberdare, where, in 1832, he married, raised a family, and spent the rest of his life running the Stag Inn. He first became politically active during the time of the Chartists and contributed to their Welsh journal, Udgorn Cymru. At this time, he was also a member of a society known as the 'Free Enquirers' at Aberdare. In 1841, Williams held the first of many eisteddfodau at the Stag, and a friendly society known as the 'Cymreigyddion of the Carw Coch' was established. Amongst those associated with this movement was David Williams (Alaw Goch), the Rev. Thomas Price of Calfaria, Aberdare and many other local poets and writers. The Carw Coch eisteddfod continued for many years and many of the compositions published in a volume known as Gardd Aberdâr (1853 onwards). Williams was a staunch Unitarian, a leading member of Hen Dy Cwrdd at Trecynon and a contributor to their journal, Yr Ymofynydd. He was also one of the founders of the newspaper Y Gwladgarwr ( 1857–83) and wrote a regular column for the paper until his death. During the 1869 General Election he played a peripheral role in the campaign of Henry Richard and sought assurances at a meeting held at Ebenezer, Trecynon that Richard supported the reform of the House of Lords. Williams died on 26 September 1872, and was buried at St Fagan's, Aberdare. His son, Lewis Noah Williams (Ap Carw Coch) became a leading public figure and a member of the Aberdare Urban District Council."

As a king of the 14th dynasty, he would have reigned from Avaris over the eastern Nile Delta and possibly over the western Delta as well. The Memphis-based 13th Dynasty reigned over Middle and Upper Egypt at the same time. Alternatively, according to Jürgen von Beckerath and Wolfgang Helck, Wazad was a ruler of the 16th Dynasty and a vassal of the Hyksos 15th Dynasty. This view is debated in egyptology, in particular because Ryholt and others have argued that the 16th Dynasty was an independent Theban kingdom rather than a vassal dynasty of the Hyksos."

  "text" : "William Millard (11 January 1844 – 8 October 1921) was an Australian politician. He was born in Wollongong to storekeeper Richard Millard and Anne, née Radler. In 1854 his family moved to Ulladulla, and he was educated locally before entering his father's tanning business. He married his first wife, Mary Walter, in 1866 at Shellharbour; they had four children. He was a lieutenant in the Ulladulla Voluntary Rifles from 1869 to 1882, a captain in the Ulladulla Corps reserve from 1882 to 1884, and a captain in the 2nd Infantry Regiment from 1884 to 1893. In 1894 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Free Trade member for Moruya. In 1904 Moruya was replaced by Clyde, during which time the Free Trade Party had become the Liberal Reform Party. Clyde in turn was replaced by Bega in 1913. With the introduction of proportional representation in 1920 he ran as a Nationalist for Goulburn but was defeated; he returned briefly after Augustus James' sudden resignation but died in 1921 at Bondi. Despite twenty-seven years in parliament he never served as a minister."

He relocated to the United States in 1859, where he lived until his death. Throughout his life, he was employed at various places, including at W. & J. Sloane, where he worked for 24 years. After retiring to a house on Scarborough Road in the small community of Whitson's Corners, New York, he developed the surrounding farmland into a suburban village. Law died in 1924 in Summerville, South Carolina, during rest cure treatment."

  "text" : "Wilbur Hobby (November 8, 1925 – May 9, 1992) rose from very modest means in Durham, North Carolina to become a prominent leader in North Carolina’s labor movement. He was the President of the North Carolina chapter of the American Federation of Labor – Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) from 1969-1981. Hobby also was active in North Carolina politics, running unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Governor in 1972. Hobby strove to provide security and stability to the working lives of ordinary people, something he never had as a child. He used politics as a means to this end, but he entered the field at a time when segregationist forces were still very strong in the South. Hobby attempted to counter this by promoting a populist message that crossed racial lines that he hoped would become part of mainstream political conversation in North Carolina. However, his career ended in scandal with a conviction on felony corruption charges in 1981."

  "text" : "Brigadier-General Walter Buckingham Caddell (22 September 1879 – 20 April 1944) was a Royal Artillery, Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force officer who served in a number of senior military aviation appointments during World War I. Born on 22 September 1879, the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Caddell and his wife Anna Matilda (née Persse), Walter Caddell was to grow up in a large family being the fourth child amongst nine children. He was commissioned a Second lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery on 26 May 1900, and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 29 March 1902. In March 1916 Caddell was appointed Deputy Assistant Director of Military Aeronautics at the War Office in London. He effectively served as the chief assistant to Brigadier-General Duncan MacInnes, the Director of Aircraft Equipment. It was in that capacity that he was introduced to George Constantinescu who had developed an experimental synchronization gear. With support from the Military Aeronautics Directorate, Constantinescu's synchronization gear was improved and deployed on aircraft in France. In April 1917 Caddell took over from an overworked and exhausted MacInnes as Director of Aircraft Equipment. He retired from the RAF on 28 May 1919 with the honorary rank of brig-gen."

  "text" : "Wilhelm (Guillermo) Gustav Franz Herter (10 January 1884 in Berlin – 17 April 1958 in Hamburg) was a German botanist and mycologist. In 1908 he received his doctorate in Berlin with a dissertation on the genus Lycopodium. From 1923 to 1939 he lived and worked in Uruguay, gaining Uruguayan citizenship in 1925. In Montevideo, he was associated with its botanical garden and museum, and in the meantime taught classes at the university. In 1934 he became director of the Revista Sudamericana de Botánica. Known for his work in the fields of systematics and taxonomy, he is credited with identifying more than 200 species new to science. He was a leading expert on the botanical order Lycopodiales. Taxa with the specific epithet of herteri are named in his honor, an example being the mycological species Tulostoma herteri."

  "text" : "Wong Hong Mok (better known as better known as Huang Hongmo) is a xinyao (Singapore Chinese folk-pop) singer-songwriter, music producer and professional photographer from Singapore. He, along with Liang Wern Fook and others are seen as pioneers of the genre. His singing style has been described as bold and unrestrained but, unlike other xinyao singer-songwriters, writes about nature, and self. He has said that this comes from the time in his life when he spent a lot of time near the sea. Crediting his father for his love of music, he is a self-taught musician; his family was too poor for him to be able to take music lessons. As well as playing the guitar, he taught himself how to play the harmonica and the piano. As he grew up, he found most of the music that was around in the Chinese music scene, meaningless; however, inspired by the music of Lo Ta-Yu (罗大佑) from Taiwan, whose writings he found more meaningful, he started to write his own songs and, in 1982, wrote his first song, Discard (抛). His songs were firs heard on the radio in 1984 on the Chinese radio programme New Voices, New Songs (歌韵新声), which was seen as a gateway for young musicians. He won the “The Best Lyrics Award” at the 1999 New Ballad Festival (新谣节). In June 2004, Wong Hong Mok was the first to represent Singapore in the 2nd Asia Music Concert (第二届中新歌会). In 1990, his first album \"Wild Man's Dream\" (野人的梦) was well received by music lovers. He remains the all-time favourite guest performer on MediaCorp Channel 8. His works include: \n*  \"Endless Enchantment\" (万种风情) \n*  \"Childhood Homeland\" (童言故乡) \n*  \"The Wild Man's Dreams\" (野人的梦) \n*  \"The Soliloquy of a Stupid Bird\" (笨鸟的表白) \n*  \"Sunset Lake Colours\" (夕阳湖色) \n*  \"Mountain Affair\" (山情)  \n*  \"Final Reminiscence\" (最后的惦记) \n*  \"If You Haven't Been Here Before\" (如果你不曾来过)  \n*  \"Cherish\" (惜缘)  \n*  \"No Return\" (不能回头) \n*  \"Silence\" (沉默)"

  "text" : "Wilhelm Friedrich Georg Behn (25 December 1808, Kiel – 14 May 1878, Dresden) was a German anatomist and zoologist. For eight years he was president of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. From 1828 he studied medicine at the Universities of Göttingen and Kiel, afterwards continuing his education in Paris (1834), where he made the acquaintanceship of famed scientists that included Dupuytren, Flourens, Poiseuille and Chevreul. In 1837 he was named an associate professor of anatomy and physiology as well as director of the anatomical institute and the zoological museum at Kiel. In 1845–47 he participated in a circumnavigation of the globe aboard the Danish ship \"Galathea\". As a result of the expedition, he collected valuable natural history material for the zoological museum in Kiel. After his return to Kiel, he was appointed a full professor of anatomy and zoology (1848). In 1867 he resigned his professorship at Kiel as a protest against the annexation of Holstein by Prussia and the formation of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein. He then relocated to Dresden, where from 1870 until his death in 1878, he served as president of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina."

  "text" : "Werner Keller (August 13, 1909 in Gut Nutha, Anhalt – February 29, 1980 in Ascona) was a German civil servant, journalist, nonfiction author and anti-Nazi resistance fighter. He studied Engineering and Medicine, and then Jurisprudence, in Berlin, Rostock, Zurich and Jena. In 1933 he became a Doctor of Jurisprudence. While working as a senior staff member in Albert Speer's Ministry of Armaments, he saved the lives of many Jews. In 1945 Keller organized an anti-Nazi resistance group in Berlin which briefly ran a pirate radio station and which planned a rather foolhardy attempt on Hitler's life. He was caught and sentenced by the Nazi Volksgerichtshof (\"People's Court\") to death by hanging. In February 1945 high-ranking friends managed, possibly by a bribe, to get his execution put off at the last moment and get him transferred to Fort Zinna, the Wehrmacht prison in Torgau. There, Keller was at the end of April 1945 liberated by American troops of the 69th Infantry Division. After the Second World War Keller worked as a journalist and a science writer in Hamburg. He has worked for Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (The North West German Broadcasting Corporation) and for such papers and magazines as Die Welt, Die Zeit, Stern, and Neue Illustrierte. He sometimes used the pseudonym Norman Alken. In 1955 he published \"The Bible as History\", his best-known and most successful book, which correlated the text of the Bible with the results of archaeological diggings in the Middle East, providing, according to Keller, a confirmation for the Bible's veracity which was not dependent on religious faith. It had a circulation of over one million in Germany and has been translated into more than 20 languages, and in 1957 gained him the Italian Literary Prize Premio Bancarella. Among others, it was successfully translated into Hebrew at a time when cultural relations with Germany were far from taken for granted in Israel; the \"Davar\" Labour daily in Tel Aviv in 1958 distributed free copies of Keller's book to its subscribers. Among his other works, the socio-historical book East Minus West Equals Zero, in which the author asserts that all political, scientific and cultural achievements of Russians from medieval times to the onset of Space Race have their origin in West, from where they were imported and copied, gained the attention of the Western public. Later books by Keller dealt with the history and culture of the Etruscans."

  "text" : "William Prince Ford (January 15, 1803 – August 23, 1866) was a preacher and planter in pre-Civil War Louisiana. He was the slave owner who first bought Solomon Northup, a free African-American, after Northup had been kidnapped in Washington, D.C., and sold in New Orleans. Those events happened in 1841. After selling Northup to another slaveholder, Ford in 1843 converted, with most of his Baptist congregation, to the Churches of Christ, to which Ford had become influenced by the writings of Alexander Campbell. Campbell visited the congregation in 1857, at which time Campbell was favorably impressed by the fellowship practiced between blacks and whites in the congregation. As of 2014 the congregation continues as the Cheneyville Christian Church. It is the oldest congregation associated with the Restoration Movement in Louisiana. In the 2013 feature film 12 Years a Slave, Ford was portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch. Some of Ford's descendants have objected to the portrayal in the film as rendering Ford as a \"pompous hypocrite; a weak-willed man unable to protect Northup and his fellow slaves from sadistic overseers in the cotton fields,\" in contrast to Northup's own description of Ford as a humane man: \"There never was a more kind, noble, candid Christian man than William Ford.\""

He also organized a protest against the decision of the U.S government to treat the guerillas as enemies. He married Celia Mariano, a Filipina who is a member of the HUKBALAHAP in 1948. In 1952 he and Celia were captured by government forces in the Sierra Madre in the Philippines. Sentenced to life, the couple were released in 1962, but Celia was refused a passport. So Bill started campaigning, lobbying Bertrand Russell and Graham Greene. The fight was successful but - denied US entry - the Pomeroys moved to England."

  "text" : "Wankard Pooser (September 27, 1893 – February 22, 1978) was an American politician in the state of Florida. Pooser was born in 1893 at DeFuniak Springs, Florida. He attended public schools in the area. He was later a farmer, lawyer, schoolteacher, mover, and newspaper publisher. He ran the Times-courier in Marianna from 1947 to 1951 and another publication entitled Wankard Pooser's Bumblebee – The Paper With A String, which ceased publication in 1958. Residing in Marianna, Florida, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives to represent Jackson County, Florida in 1944, with his term starting in 1945. It was said that his legislative goals were to \"curb the growing tendency toward dictatorship in American Government, and to put some brakes on run-a-way taxes\". He also made a campaign promise to reject every single bill that was presented to him, a promise which he would only stray from once in his legislative career. In the 1945 legislative session, Pooser was involved in an incident which he introduced a law in the house calling for additional regulation at Jackson County hospitals. When the bill was opposed by fellow member John Lambe, Pooser brought up the fact that Lambe's newborn child had died at a hospital earlier that week, causing Lambe to \"break down\" and withdraw from the debate. Pooser later apologized and requested to be excused from further attendance in that legislative session. Also notably, upon the passing of a sales tax bill in the house, Pooser dropped to the chamber floor and started praying for the taxpayers of Florida. Pooser was a critic of economic policy, with a newspaper describing him as a \"stormy petrel of the economy bloc\". He was also a vocal critic of the administration of the Governor of Florida, Fuller Warren. In 1946, Pooser was an unsuccessful candidate for the Florida State Senate; in that same election, his wife, Maude also ran unsuccessfully for the State House of Representatives. Pooser was defeated in 1949 for his seat in the house, and left the seat in 1950. He attempted a comeback in 1952, but was defeated in a primary by Hugh Dukes by a margin of 24 votes. He was married to Maude Marie Brogdon at Jackson County on August 15, 1915, and with her had eleven children. Pooser died at Jackson County in 1978 and was buried at Pope Cemetery in Sneads, Jackson County, Florida. He was predeceased by his wife, who died December 15, 1966 at the age of 68. In a 1958 article, Pooser referred to himself as a \"famous author, statesman, [and] poet\". It was also said that he was known around his city of residence as a \"lawyer, ex-legislator, ... noted local after-dinner speaker, wit, [and] critic\". His headstone at Pope Cemetery reads: The one and onlyWankard POOSERShe love me too27 Sep 189322 Feb 1978To be continued"

  "text" : "Werner Alfred Waldemar von Janowski, (Abwehr-codenamed \"Bobbi\"; Allied-codenamed WATCHDOG), was a captured German Second World War Nazi spy and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's first double agent. He is believed to have been a triple agent by some, underscoring the RCMP's inexperience in espionage.Due to power struggles between the Canadian and British intelligence agencies during the Second World War and the RCMP's inexperience, Operation Watchdog was a failure. Janowski provided little significant intelligence to the Allies: no Abwehr agents were arrested and no U-boats were captured, despite his apparent cooperation. Within a year the operation was shut down and Janowski was sent to a prison in Britain. Janowski disembarked from the German submarine U-518 submarine at Chaleur Bay, four miles west of New Carlisle, Quebec, around 5 a.m., on November 9, 1942. His destination was Montreal, having first to stop in New Carlisle so he could take the first train out.At 6:30 a.m., under the alias of William Brenton, Janowski checked in at Hotel New Carlisle. The son of the hotel owner grew suspicious of him, due to inconsistencies with the German spy's story. He used an out-of-circulation Canadian note when paying his bill to the owner's son and when he left to wait at the train station the suspicious son of the hotelier followed him. Constable Alfonse Duchesneau of the Quebec Provincial Police was alerted to the situation, and he boarded the train car just as it was leaving the station. Duchesneau intercepted Janowski, who maintained he was William Brenton, a radio salesman from Toronto. When his baggage was searched, Janowski immediately said to Duchesneau, \"Searching my luggage won’t be necessary. I am a German officer who serves his country as you serve yours.\" After his capture and interrogation, the Canadian military attempted to locate the German submarine in which Janowski had arrived. Despite an extensive search of Chaleur Bay, both the warship HMCS Burlington and assisting Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft were unable to locate U-518. In late August 1943, Janowski was sent to England, where he was incarcerated at Camp 020. He remained there for the duration of the war. He was repatriated to an internment camp in the British Zone of Germany in July 1945. Released in 1947, Janowski had no home to return to, as Allenstein and most of East Prussia had been annexed by Poland and its population expelled. He eventually found work as a translator, and in the 1960s worked for the German Navy. Janowski died in Spain in 1978 while on a holiday."

He succeeded to his father's title in 1824 and died three years later. He had been married three times: firstly in 1784 to Sarah Anne Falkiner, youngest daughter of Sir Riggs Falkiner, 1st Baronet, who died in 1788. He married secondly in 1790 Frances Sage; this marriage ended in 1796 with a divorce by Act of Parliament, by which both parties were free to remarry (Frances remarried Boyle O'Sullivan). His third wife was Clara Jones, who outlived him. He left daughters, but no surviving male issue, and was succeeded by his nephew, Thomas de Moleyns, 3rd Baron Ventry."

At NIDA he was one of the key researchers who changed the medical view of tobacco smoking from an unhealthy habit to a diagnosable drug addiction—after which cigarette makers nicknamed him \"Doctor Death\" to the tobacco industry.

Although it is a minority party that received fewer than 3,000 first preference votes in 2013, under the Australian Single Transferable Vote system it was predicted for a length of time that the party would receive the required 123,304 total votes to fulfil a Senate quota in Western Australia. Dropulich did not win a seat in the initial count but was elected to the Senate in a recount. With the prospect of the Motoring Enthusiast and Sports parties each winning a senate seat despite getting to the 14.3 percent quota with preference flows from record-low primary votes of 0.5 percent in Victoria and 0.2 percent in Western Australia respectively, various parties and MPs including the incoming government sought Senate reform. This was achieved by the Coalition government with support from Labor and The Greens before the 2016 election. The Sports Party has been involved in Glenn Druery's Minor Party Alliance."

Poulson gave Pottinger gifts worth over £30,000 over six years, and was appointed by Pottinger as architect in charge of the Aviemore project. Nicknamed 'Gorgeous George', Pottinger lived in a house, The Pelicans, overlooking Muirfield golf course in Gullane, and was at the golf club on 22 June 1973, when the Fraud Squad's Kenneth Everidge arrived at his home to arrest him. He had already been suspended from his Permanent Secretary post at the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Scotland, following allegations raised at Poulson's earlier bankruptcy hearing. Pottinger returned home, and was arrested and charged with corruption in connection with the award of building contracts. A 52-day trial at Leeds Crown Court followed, with Pottinger and T. Dan Smith as Poulson's co-accused. During the trial, the court heard how Poulson's meticulously recorded relationship with Pottinger saw the civil servant showered with 'gifts', including foreign holidays, Savile Row suits and a Rover car. Poulson also designed Pottinger's home for free and paid £20,000 towards the mortgage. All three were found guilty on 11 February 1974 of fraud. On 15 March 1974, Poulson was gaoled for five years (later increased to seven); George Pottinger was gaoled for five years. Sentencing Pottinger to jail, Mr Justice Waller said: \"You have let down the honourable service to which you belonged.\" Pottinger's sentence was later reduced to four years on appeal. He was also dismissed from the civil service, forfeiting a retirement lump sum, and had his pension cut in half. Following his release from prison, he moved to Cambridgeshire, where he wrote books, and died, aged 81, in 1998. Pottinger's son Piers was head of the City public relations firm Lowe Bell Financial, today Bell Pottinger Private. His younger brother Don Pottinger was an artist and illustrator, and served as a Scottish Herald."

Johnson was elected leader of the Labor Party (and thus leader of the opposition) in October 1905, but three weeks later lost his own seat at the 1905 state election. He had previously been a minister in the government of Henry Daglish (from August 1904 to August 1905), and later returned to the ministry under John Scaddan (from October 1911 to July 1916). Towards the end of his career, Johnson also served just under a year as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, from 1938 to 1939."

At the age of 12, Calhoun attended a boarding school in Cherokee, North Carolina, where he learned the English language. Before that time, he had rarely heard English since his mother did not speak it. During World War II, he was drafted and served as a combat engineer in Germany. Calhoun started learning Cherokee songs from an early age. He had learned most of the social, hunt, and sacred songs from his uncle, Will West Long, by the time he was nine years old."

  "text" : "William York Tindall (1903–1981) was an American James Joyce scholar with a long and distinguished teaching career at Columbia University. Several of Tindall's classic works of criticism, including A Reader's Guide to James Joyce and A Reader's Guide to Finnegans Wake are still in print. He wrote a total of thirteen books on UK and Irish authors including Joyce, Dylan Thomas, William Butler Yeats, and Samuel Beckett. Born in Vermont, he studied at Columbia, both as an undergraduate and graduate student. Between those courses of study, in 1925 he set off to see Europe. He went to Paris and bought a copy of Joyce's Ulysses — then banned in America. By chance, he bought it on June 16, Bloomsday, the day in which all the events in the book take place. He had it rebound as a French novel to carry it through US Customs. That began Professor Tindall's study of and advocacy for Joyce's works in America; in fact, he started teaching Ulysses even before the book was allowed in the US. Therefore, students in his first Ulysses course were forced to read the dean's copy kept secured in the university library. Finally in 1933, the United States District Court in New York City ruled that the novel was not obscene and could be published in America. In January, 1934 Ulysses was finally available legally in the US and no one had to rely on the library copy any more. Professor Tindall's teaching career at Columbia lasted from 1931 to 1971. For four decades, he taught some of the most popular literary criticism courses in the curriculum. He pioneered a method of reading Joyce's most difficult novel Finnegans Wake with a small group of graduate students, everyone adding a bit of their academic knowledge to the task. He called this Reading by Committee, saying that the group brought to it \"a variety of languages and learning, [and] might do more with the book than I alone, with small learning and less Greek.\""

  "text" : "William \"Bill\" Peters CMG, LVO, MBE (28 September 1923 – 23 March 2014) was a British diplomat who co-founded the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign. Peters was born at Morpeth, Northumberland. The highlight of his career after retirement was his co-founding, with Martin Dent of Keele University, of the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign, which went on to become the Make Poverty History movement. He studied Greats at Balliol College, Oxford, but his studies were interrupted by World War II when he saw active service with the 9th Ghurkha rifles. After the war he completed his undergraduate studies in 1948 and went on to further study at the LSE and SOAS. Peters then joined the Colonial Service with a posting to the Gold Coast in 1950 where he worked to prepare for the transition to independence. In 1977, he became British Ambassador to Uruguay. He went on to work as High Commissioner in Malawi before retiring from the Foreign Office in 1983. A few years after retirement Peters met Martin Dent of Keele University and realised that Martin shared his concern at what they considered to be unsustainable levels of third world debt. They co-founded a campaign to write off third-world debt in time for the Millennium. They called this Jubilee 2000 in reference to the Old Testament Jubilee requirement to cancel debts every seven years. It was supported by the Anglican Church, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, addressing a rally in Trafalgar Square with Bill and Martin and making Jubilee 2000 the subject of his New Year's Day Millennium address on BBC 1. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown also spoke at a rally in St Paul's Cathedral, strongly supporting the campaign and confirming the cancellation of all debts to the UK. Peters continued to play an active role in the Drop the Debt campaign in the lead up to the Millennium, seeing it grow into a series of large- scale demonstrations and twice enter The Guinness Book Of Records, once for the largest petition and once for the most international petition. The campaign launched major demonstrations at every G8 summit from 1998 in Birmingham to Cologne and Genoa with a few people even travelling to Okinawa in Japan. Peters received the Gandhi International Peace Award from the Gandhi Foundation in recognition of his efforts and of the success of the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which 'made possible the provision of basic education and health-care to thousands of people.' He died on 23 March 2014."

  "text" : "Dr. Wesley Muhammad is an American author, historian, professor, scholar, and a minister in the Nation of Islam. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies from Morehouse College (Atlanta, GA), graduating with honors in 1994. In 2003 Dr. Muhammad received a master's degree in Islamic Studies from the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), whence he also received a Ph.D. in Islamic Studies with a focus on Early Theological Development in Islam. Dr. Muhammad’s doctoral work included training in Classical Arabic, Biblical Hebrew, German and French and he conducts research in those languages. Twice as a graduate student Dr. Muhammad’s research earned him the highly honored, Great Books of Islam Prize, given out by the Center For Middle East and Near Eastern Studies, University of Michigan. Dr. Muhammad has been invited to present his research at the University of Chicago, Duke University, Emory University, Michigan State University, Western Kentucky University, Howard University, Cleveland State University, Morehouse College, Spelman College and Clark Atlanta University. In September, 2002, Dr. Muhammad was one of a number of scholars selected to present at the First World Congress for Middle Eastern Studies held in Mainz, Germany, where 2000 scholars from over 14 different countries participated. He was asked by members of the organizing committee to chair the panels on Islamic Theology. Dr. Muhammad’s research has been published or accepted for publication in some of the most respected peer-reviewed journals of his fields: The International Journal of Middle East Studies, The Journal of the American Oriental Society, The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, and The Harvard Theological Review. Dr. Muhammad has recently been asked to contribute to the much anticipated upcoming Encyclopedia of Muhammad, to be published by one of the leading Western publishers in academic and reference publications. Dr. Muhammad has taught courses on Islamic Studies, Religious Studies, African American Religion, and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Michigan, the University of Toledo, and Michigan State University. Dr. Muhammad’s scholarship is both deconstructionist as well as constructionist. Not only has he challenged important aspects of the Orthodox Islamic historical-theological tradition, but he is also helping to construct a totally new historical paradigm for Islam. Dr. Wesley Muhammad is popular among the grassroots because of his credentials in the ‘Movement’. In 1990 as a freshman at Morehouse, he met Wakeel Allah who recruited him into the Five Percent Nation. As a fiery Five Percenter at Morehouse College, Dr. Muhammad became known as ‘True Islam’, became one of the most visible student activists at the Atlanta University Center. Between the years 1992–1994, Dr. Muhammad, as 'Student Minister Wesley X,' was appointed by the Southern Regional Minister of the Nation of Islam to represent the local and regional Mosque among the colleges and universities around the Atlanta Metro area. Dr. Muhammad was president of the first Nation of Islam Students Association at Morehouse College in 1993–94, and was featured in British Broadcasting Communications documentary, 'The Morehouse Men,' which aired nationally in 1995. Dr. Muhammad is the author of several works, including: The Book of God: An Encyclopedia of Proof that the Black Man is God; Black Arabia and the African Origin of Islam and Take Another Look: The Qur'an, The Sunna, and the Islam of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. On January 10, 2010 the United Muslim Alliance and the New Black Panther Party (NY) presented Dr. Muhammad with The Dr. Khalid Abdul Muhammad Sayful Islam Award and on January 30, 2010 Student Minister Rodney Muhammad and the members of Muhammad Mosque #12 (Philly) and the Delaware Valley Region presented him with the \"Defender of the Ummah\" Award. Dr. Muhammad is currently a scholarly aide to Minister Louis Farrakhan at Nation of Islam National Headquarters Mosque Maryam in Chicago."

Parsons later worked in the newspaper business in Texas. When the Civil War began, he received a commission as a colonel from Governor Edward Clark. His Fourth Regiment Texas Volunteer Cavalry became the Twelfth Texas Cavalry when the unit was mustered into the Confederate army on October 28, 1861. Parsons helped defend Little Rock, Arkansas against a Union army led by Brigadier General Samuel Curtis and Louisiana from Major General Nathaniel Banks. He was recommended for the rank of brigadier general several times. After the war, he left Texas to investigate the possibility of establishing a Confederate colony in British Honduras. He returned to be elected to the Texas state senate. In 1871, President Grant appointed him a centennial commissioner, and he moved to New York. In 1907, he died at the home of his son in Chicago and was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, Hastings-on-Hudson, New York."
