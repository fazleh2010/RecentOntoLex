  "text" : "Ansaldi was an Italian automobile manufacturer founded in Milan in 1904 by Michele Ansaldi an engineer, designer, and industrialist. The only car they produced was sold as the F.I.A.T. Brevetti after the company was taken over in 1905. In 1904 the Ansaldi automobile company in Milan manufactured a small car with a Fiat 10/12 HP engine. It featured the world's first 'pre-formed' chassis, plus a drive shaft and differential unit with bevelled gears and universal joints. In 1905 Fiat bought Ansaldi and launched the car as the Fiat-Ansaldi 10-12 HP. In 1906 it was renamed the Fiat Societa-Brevetti, and 1,600 were produced by 1912 with the Fiat Brevetti 2."

  "text" : "Anselmo A. Lastra is an American computer scientist, a Professor and the former Chair of the Computer Science Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His research interests are in the areas of 3D computer graphics, graphics hardware architectures, and virtual reality. Lastra received a BS in Electrical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and MA and PhD degrees in Computer Science from Duke University. He has chaired a number of conferences, including I3D 2005 and Graphics Hardware 2002 and 2004, and served as associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics and IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications. Lastra's major contributions are in hardware-based programmable shading and in the use of graphics hardware for general purpose computing (a technique known as GPGPU). The 1998 dissertation research \"A Programmable Pipeline for Graphics Hardware\". of his student Marc Olano was on the use of a high-level language for real-time programmable shading on graphics hardware, now a common feature of GPUs. The early work was on PixelFlow, the experimental graphics computer developed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A 2002 paper coauthored with his student Mark Harris and titled Physically-Based Visual Simulation on Graphics Hardware, led to the coining of the term GPGPU and to extensive research in that field."

He was the son of a certain Farruxzadan, and is known to have held a religious disputation in 825 at the Abbasid court with the former Zoroastrian Abalish, known as \"the apostate\" and formerly called Dadv-Ohrmazd. Aturfarnbag managed to win the debate and Abalish was removed from the Abbasid court. Aturfarnbag is also known to have written the Denkard, an Encyclopedia about Zoroastrian beliefs and customs. He also wrote the book Ēwēn-nāmag on the tenets of the Zoroastrian religion. The fourth Book of Denkard is regarded as a condensed version of this work. Aturfarnbag was later succeeded by his son Zardusht. He also had another son named Goshnjam, who, like his father, would later have a distinguished career. Another Zoroastrian high-priest named Adurbad-i Emedan would later edit the Denkard, putting much more information about Zoroastrian beliefs and customs. Aturfarnbag was also the ancestor of the prominent Zoroastrian Manushcihr-i Goshn-Yam, who wrote the Dadestan-i Denig."

An alumnus of the Raffles Institution, Ahmad Mattar graduated from the University of Singapore with a degree in physics in 1963. He completed his master's degree at the University of Sheffield on a Colombo Plan scholarship and then his doctorate at the University of Singapore. Prior to entering politics, he was a lecturer at Singapore Polytechnic and conducted the first large-scale study on the effects of traffic noise on housing estates; the study would later inform future legislations and studies on traffic noise. In 1972, he ran for the Leng Kee Single Member Constituency at the recommendation of Abdul Rahim Ishak, then the MP for Siglap SMC. From 1985 to 1995, he was appointed as the Minister for the Environment. During his tenure as the Minister for the Environment, he was known for tightening restrictions on the sale of aerosols containing CFCs and introducing the Corrective work order (CWO) to combat littering. He had intended to resign from Cabinet in 1991 but was persuaded to remain by newly elected Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. In 1996 he retired from politics and has largely kept a low profile. Dr Ahmad Mattar was also the founding president of Mendaki (1982–1989), which was established to look into the educational and welfare needs of the Malay/Muslim community."

  "text" : "Adolph Engelmann (February 11, 1825 – October 5, 1890) was a farmer, lawyer, postmaster, Mexican-American War veteran, and Union Army colonel during the American Civil War. On May 18, 1866, the United States Senate confirmed his appointment as brevet brigadier general of volunteers. Engelmann was born in Imsbach, then in the Kingdom of Bavaria, on February 11, 1825. His family immigrated to the United States in 1831. He served as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Regiment of Illinois Volunteers (12 months) during the Mexican–American War. He was wounded at the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847. After becoming a Chicago lawyer, Engelmann briefly served in the army of the German duchy of Schleswig-Holstein. On December 16, 1861, Engelmann was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of the 43rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He participated with his regiment in garrisoning Fort Donelson after its capture by the Union Army under Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant. As commander of the regiment, he fought at the Battle of Shiloh. He was promoted to colonel of the regiment on April 12, 1862. Engelmann succeeded Colonel Julius Raith, his company captain in the Mexican-American War, who was mortally wounded while commanding the brigade which included his 43rd Illinois Infantry Regiment at the Battle of Shiloh. While still colonel of the 43rd Illinois Infantry Regiment, Engelmann commanded brigades, and briefly divisions, during the remainder of his term or service. From May 28, 1863 to August 10, 1863, including the Siege of Vicksburg, Engelmann commanded the 1st Brigade, Kimball's Division, XVI Corps, Army of the Tennessee. He commanded Division 2 of the same corps, then in the Army of Arkansas, from September 6, 1863 to September 31, 1863 before resuming command of his brigade in that division. He participated in the capture of Little Rock, Arkansas. On January 6, 1864, the Army of Arkansas became the Department of Arkansas. Engelmann took command of the 2nd Brigade, Division 2, VII Corps. He commanded two other brigades in Division 3 and Division 1 of the VII Corps during most of the remainder of 1863. He commanded Division 1 of the VII Corps between September 9, 1864 and September 25, 1864. During this time, he participated in the Camden Expedition, a subsidiary action of the Red River Campaign. Engelmann was mustered out of the Union Army volunteers on December 16, 1864. On May 18, 1866, the U.S. Senate confirmed Engelmann's appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, for faithful and meritorious services. The sources do not have the date of his nomination by President Andrew Johnson. Adolph Engelmann died on October 5, 1890 at Shiloh, Illinois.

  "text" : "Alice Day Pratt was a teacher and author who at age 40 joined the last wave of government-sponsored homesteading in the U.S. state of Oregon. Pratt, who was single, established a dryland farm and ranch near Post, about 60 miles (97 km) east of Bend. The 160-acre (65 ha) parcel of land became hers through provisions of the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909. Living on her ranch, Broadview, from 1912 through 1930, she kept dogs, cats, horses, chickens, and cows and sometimes produced enough surplus to sell alfalfa, hay, grain, milk, eggs, and vegetables. To supplement her income, she taught school in Post, Prineville, and Conant Basin. Born in Minnesota in 1872, Pratt grew up there and in South Dakota, later teaching in the South before moving to Oregon to start a new life. Living at first in a tent, Pratt worked Broadview primarily by herself with occasional help from neighbors and other homesteaders. They eventually helped her build a barn and a wooden house consisting of a single room measuring 12 by 20 feet (4 by 6 m). She wrote about her initial Broadview experience in A Homesteader's Portfolio, first published in 1922. Cold, wind, snow, and drought eventually forced her to sell her dairy herd to repay a loan, and in 1930 she gave up dryland farming and moved east to Niagara Falls, to live with her mother and sister. Later relocating to New York City, she retained possession of Broadview until 1950. First published by The Macmillan Company, A Homesteader's Portfolio was reprinted by the Oregon State University Press in 1993. Pratt's other work includes Animal Babies and Animals of a Sagebrush Ranch, both for juvenile readers, as well as Three Frontiers, and the Alice Day Pratt Papers, 1960. Unpublished work includes a novel called Sagebrush Fires, several short stories, and Teacher's Trek, a memoir about her teaching experiences."

Both women were born in Aldershot, England, in 1936. Their mother could not afford to keep both of them since she was a domestic servant. Elizabeth was kept because she had curvature of the spine and her mother thought that it would be difficult for her to be adopted. Ann was adopted and raised as an only child. As an adult, Elizabeth met an American and moved to the United States. On 1 May 2014, the sisters were reunited again in Fullerton, California, United States. The women spent the next day undergoing testing at the Twin Studies Center at California State University in Fullerton, which does research into how genes and environment affect development. The research was published in a 2015 paper in the journal Personality and Individual Differences (Segal et al.. Genetic and experiential influences on behavior: Twins reunited at seventy-eight years. Personality & Individual Differences, 73, 110-117.). Additional material on twins raised apart is available in Segal, N.L. (2012).

Outlaw represented Jefferson County in the Tennessee House of Representatives during the First General Assembly (1796). He represented Jefferson in the Tennessee Senate during the Third General Assembly (1799–1801), and was elected Speaker. After his senate term, he focused primarily on land speculation and law. He died in Dallas County, Alabama, in 1826. Rural Mount, a house built by Outlaw for his son-in-law, Joseph Hamilton, still stands near Morristown, Tennessee, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

  "text" : "Aiko Herzig-Yoshinaga (born August 5, 1925) is a political activist who played a major role in the Japanese American redress movement. She was the lead researcher of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, a bipartisan federal committee appointed by Congress in 1980 to review the causes and effects of the Japanese American incarceration during World War II. Herzig-Yoshinaga, who was confined in the Manzanar, California and Jerome and Rohwer, Arkansas concentration camps as a young woman, uncovered government documents that debunked the wartime administration's claims of \"military necessity\" and helped compile the CWRIC's final report, Personal Justice Denied, which led to the issuance of a formal apology and reparations for former camp inmates. She also contributed pivotal evidence and testimony to the Hirabayashi, Korematsu and Yasui coram nobis cases. Herzig-Yoshinaga was a high school senior in Los Angeles, California when President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized military commanders to designate areas from which \"any or all persons may be excluded,\" and she was forced to leave school for camp before receiving her diploma. She gave birth to her first child in Manzanar, before transferring to Jerome and Rohwer and eventually divorcing her then-husband. After the war, she left camp and settled in New York. She remarried and had two more children before divorcing again, and took a job as a clerical worker to support her family. In the 1960s, Herzig-Yoshinaga became involved with Asian Americans for Action, a civil rights organization. In 1978, she married John Herzig and moved to Washington, D.C., where she began examining documents on the incarceration that had recently been made available to the public in the National Archives. Often putting in fifty- or sixty-hour weeks, she worked to retrieve and catalog thousands of significant documents over the next several years. She joined the National Council for Japanese American Redress in 1980 (the same year the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was created) and contributed her archival research to NCJAR's class-action lawsuit seeking reparations from the government. The following year, in 1981, Herzig-Yoshinaga was hired by the CWRIC as its lead researcher, and she soon after unearthed one of the most significant pieces of evidence in the case for redress. The wartime military leadership had attempted to destroy its \"Final Report on Japanese Evacuation from the West Coast,\" which explicitly stated that intelligence sources agreed Japanese Americans posed no threat to U.S. security, in 1943; Herzig-Yoshinaga tracked down the single remaining copy of the Final Report and shared it with the CWRIC, NCJAR and redress activists. Thanks in large part to the discovery of this document, the convictions of Gordon Hirabayashi, Fred Korematsu, and Minoru Yasui were overturned, and the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 granted an official apology and $20,000 to each camp survivor or their heirs. Herzig-Yoshinaga later worked in the Department of Justice's Office of Redress Administration to identify Japanese Americans eligible for reparations."

His prowess led to his inclusion in a national Public Schools XI in 1904, and he proceeded to join Gloucestershire in 1905. Imlay made his first class cricket debut for Gloucestershire in a University match on 25 May 1905 against Cambridge University. He made 17 and 12 with the bat, but 45 extras were conceded in the form of byes. Imlay would go on to join Cambridge University in 1906 and play cricket for the First XI until 1907, playing three matches in total, taking four catches and scoring 20 runs. He then returned to Gloucestershire and played sporadically until 1911, making a total of six more appearances for the county though never bettering his debut score of 17. He took four catches for the county in total, and performed one stumping. He did however make one appearance for the Gentlemen, where he took four catches, and also played for Leveson-Gower's invitational team, for whom he made his career-best score of 26 with the bat. He died in Brent Knoll, north of Burnham on Sea in Somerset."

  "text" : "Ainsley Iggo (2 August 1924 – 25 March 2012) was a New Zealand born neurophysiologist. He was born in Napier, New Zealand and studied at a farming college in Invercargill, where he won a bursary to study Agricultural Sciences at the University of New Zealand. There he was awarded a research scholarship to continue his studies in Britain. After gaining a BSc in electrophysiology and neuroscience at the University of Otago in Dunedin, he moved to Aberdeen to join the Rowett Research Institute, an agricultural research facility of the University of Aberdeen. There he was awarded a PhD for his studies on the vagus nerve of sheep. He moved to Edinburgh in 1954, where he began as a lecturer in physiology at the Medical School of Edinburgh University before accepting the Chair of Veterinary Physiology at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies of Edinburgh University in 1962. He played the major role in establishing the school, commonly known as the Dick Vet, into an internationally recognised centre of excellence, before becoming dean of the School. He remained as professor emeritus of veterinary physiology until his death. In 1958 he became the first scientist to demonstrate electrical recordings from individual C fibres, the thinnest of the body’s nerves and also defined the function of the various sensory receptors in the skin which detect touch, tickle, heat and pain. One of the receptors is now named after him. In 1973 he was a founder member and later president (1981–84) of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1978 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He died in March, 2012. He had married New Zealander Betty McCurdy in 1952, with whom he had 3 sons."

  "text" : "Alexis Jean Fournier was an American artist. He is well known in Minnesota for his naturalistic paintings of Minneapolis and St. Paul landmarks, such as Farnham's Mill, which was one of the earliest mills established in Minneapolis. Fournier is also renowned beyond Minnesota as an important figure in the Arts and Crafts movement. Born in St. Paul, Minnesota on July 4, 1865, Fournier was raised in Wisconsin by French Canadian parents. In 1879, at the age of fourteen, Fournier moved to Minneapolis. Aspiring to be an artist, Fournier found work painting signs and stage scenery. Creating stage scenery gave him more time for his own painting and gave him experience painting panoramas, a popular nineteenth century art form. He began to experience modest success as a landscape painter. In 1886, Fournier attended a class at the newly established Minneapolis School of Art. The school was directed by Boston artist Douglas Volk, and Fournier soon took private lessons with him. Under Volk's instruction, Fournier developed a more subtle sense of color and a brushier style. During the next three years, Fournier married his first wife Emma and had two children, Grace and Paul. He also began supporting his family as a full-time artist. He rented a studio above a tailor's shop at 412 Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis. Fournier was invited to travel around the American Southwest with patron H. Jay Smith in 1891. After the trip, Fournier painted an acclaimed 50x12 foot panoramic mural that depicted stone dwellings in cliffs in the Mesa Verde region of Colorado that had been constructed by Ancient Puebloans. The panoramic was displayed at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where thousands of people saw the mural and heard Fournier interpret it publicly. Continuing to grow as an artist, in 1893, Fournier traveled to Paris, France, where he studied at the Académie Julian. His trip was funded by several benefactors, including James J. Hill. In France, Fournier was strongly influenced by the Barbizon school, a group of nineteenth century French painters who were drawn to natural landscapes and romanticism. Between 1895 and 1901, Fournier made several more trips to Paris. In between, he returned to Minneapolis and continued painting Twin Cities landmarks. He also became associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, an arts revival emphasizing handmade crafts. Arts and Craft movement leader John Scott Bradstreet invited Fournier to paint murals in Twin Cities dining rooms that he was commissioned to decorate. Fournier's connection to the Arts and Crafts movement deepened in 1903 when he moved to East Aurora, New York, home of the Roycroft arts community. The community started as a printing shop but evolved to include book art, pottery, metalwork, jewelry, and furniture. The community's leader, Elbert G. Hubbard, had been friends with Fournier for several years. Fournier's move to East Aurora came after Hubbard invited him to be the Roycroft community's permanent art director. Hubbard was a flamboyant man, and he traveled around the country giving lectures. Fournier, known for his charming personality and good humor, went with Hubbard on many of these trips. Fournier kept Hubbard company and exhibited his paintings at the lectures, bringing his work to a broader audience. Despite these travels and the many winters he spent in Minneapolis, Fournier was publicly identified with East Aurora and the Roycroft community. The Roycroft community changed in 1915 when Hubbard and his wife died aboard the Lusitania, an ocean liner that was famously torpedoed by Germans during World War I. After his friend's passing, Fournier became close to a group of regional painters in Brown County, Indiana. He influenced their style, but they also influenced his. His paintings from Indiana were brighter and more impressionistic than his earlier work. Fournier's first wife died and he sold his home in Minneapolis in 1921. He moved to Indiana the next year, when he remarried a widow whose husband had been linked to the Brown County artists. He continued to spend summers in East Aurora. After the death of his second wife in 1937, he moved to East Aurora permanently, and in 1941 he married a third time. In 1948, at the age of eighty-two, Fournier slipped on an icy sidewalk and sustained injuries resulting in his death. Through his landscape paintings and his role in the Arts and Crafts movement, Fournier made a lasting influence on American art. His obituaries revered him as \"the last of the Barbizon painters,\" since his style and admiration for the natural world brought the Barbizon tradition well into the twentieth century. His paintings were exhibited around the world during his lifetime and continue to be displayed and collected."

  "text" : "Anders Matias Abrahamsen Lothe (23 December 1875 – 1961) was a Norwegian teacher, newspaper editor and politician for the Labour Party. He was born at Lote in Gloppen as a son of farmers Abraham Jakobsen Lothe (1841–1919) and Johanne Marie Jensdotter Lothe (1840–1900). He finished Seljord Teachers' Seminary in 1896, when he was hired as a teacher in Gloppen. From 1900 to 1901 he went back to school, a private middle school in Gloppen, and took his examination at Tanks School in 1901. He then worked as a teacher in Eikefjord from 1901 to 1908 and Sparbu from 1908 to 1910. He became known as the first in Norway to write his middle school exam in Landsmål, and he also co-founded the Noregs Mållag branch Firda Mållag in 1899, chairing it from 1903 to 1908. From 1910 to 1915 he was the editor-in-chief of Firda Folkeblad. From 1915 to 1945 he was a primary school teacher in Florø. He was elected to Florø city council in 1913, not-reelected in 1916 but then steadily re-elected to serve from 1919 to 1940. He was the deputy mayor of Florø in 1925–1926, 1936 and 1940. He was also a member of Florø school board from 1914 to 1917 and 1920 to 1927. He thus took part in the foundation of Firda Upper Secondary School in 1920, chairing its supervisory council from 1922 to 1933. Lothe also co-founded the Sunnfjord branch of IOGT as well as the Kinn and Sunnfjord branches of the Labour Party. He chaired the local party branch, as well as the county branch from 1928 to 1934. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from Sogn og Fjordane in 1927, 1933 and 1936. The election in 1940 did not take place owing to the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. Lothe was arrested by the authorities in January 1943, incarcerated in Bergen Prison until February, then Ulven concentration camp until May, then Grini concentration camp from May 1943 to July 1944. He died in 1961. A street has been named after him in Florø."

  "text" : "Alexander Maclean, 13th Laird of Ardgour (16 April 1764-8 September 1855) was a soldier and Highland Laird. He was the son of Hugh, 12th MacLean of Ardgour (1736-4 September 1768) and Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Houston of Jordan Hill. He entered the army as an ensign in the 2nd battalion of the Royals, in 1780, and was promoted to a lieutenancy in the same corps, from which he afterwards exchanged into the 63rd Regiment (later the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot). He subsequently attained to the rank of captain and major in the 8th Regiment of Light Dragoons (later the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars). After leaving the regular service, he became a captain in the Hopetoun Fencibles (7th regiment of fencibles) sometime between 2 February 1793 to 1799 under James, the 3rd Earl of Hopetoun. On 29th May 1795, he was appointed Major in the Fencible cavalry of the Lothian (East and West) Regiment. He was subsequently appointed, circa 1811, lieutenant-colonel of the third regiment of local militia of the county of Argyle, the command of which he held until the regiment was disbanded. He was a splendid horseman and the most accomplished and daring rider in the Royal Caledonian Hunt, amongst whose members was Robert Burns. In June 1805 he was appointed Receiver General of Landrents, Paymaster of the Civil Establishment and Receiver General of the land tax, and assessed taxes in Scotland. This was apparently under the patronage of John, 2nd Earl of Hopeton, his brother-in-law, on a salary of £1,500. Just a year later, in June 1806, he was succeeded by Sir William A. Cunynghame of Milncraig (formerly of Livingston), Bart. He gifted the site of Ardgour Church in 1826, which is still the centre of local worship. It was built by Thomas Telford in 1829, one of forty-two in the Highlands which were part of a Parliamentary Project for The Church of Scotland. He married Lady Margaret, who died 16 September 1831, daughter of John, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun, and by her had issue: Hugh, who died in infancy.John Hugh, educated at the Scottish bar, and died at Rome in 1826.Archibald, who died in Edinburgh in 1832 after having served as a naval officer ; severely wounded ; captured by the American war vessel, Prince de Neufchatel; and in 1822, promoted to the rank of captain and commander of HMS Blossom of twenty-six guns.Alexander, heir and successor.Henry Dundas entered the army, became a major in 1832, and at different periods was resident governor of Ithaca, Cephalonia, Santa Maura, and Lante ; died in 1863.James Charles entered the military service of the East India Company, and died of fever at Calcutta in 1829.Charles Hope was educated for the English bar, and died in 1839.Elizabeth Margaret.Charlotte Margaret died in 1824.Thomas entered the East India Company's service, and died in 1840.William entered the navy, changed his name to Gunston, and died in 1851.George became a colonel in the army, and married, in 1842, a daughter of Sir Colin Campbell.Robert died in 1835.Peter, who served in the artillery and rose to the rank of Major-General, married a daughter of Lieutenant General Sir Henry Somerset, by whom he had four sons and three daughters.

Don Antonio Crisafi and his brother Thomas, who had a good military background, as he had become Knight of Malta in 1670, took part in a revolt against Spain in Sicily. The important city of Messina had at that time (1674–1678) about 100,000 inhabitants and was a dynamic port with a strategic position in the Mediterranean sea. When the senate of Messina decided to revolt against Spain, the Crisafi brothers were among the military leaders organising the defence. In 1675, Messina obtained the military support of France which was in war against Spain, and the Crisafi brothers continued fighting under the orders of the Duke of Vivonne, the commander of the French troops and a noble who was very close to King Louis XIV. Messina was able to resist against Spain and the French fleet was able to win some important naval battles against the combined fleet of Spain and Holland. But, in 1678, Louis XIV concluded the peace of Nimega and Messina was abandoned in the hands of the Spaniards. Antoine and Thomas Crisafy, like a lot of nobles of Messina, had to flee to France, leaving their assets behind. Since that time they changed their name in Crisafy, according to the French pronunciation. Probably thanks to their connection with the Duke of Vivonne, they were received in Versailles and obtained a little pension from the Sun King. They were eventually accused of a complot against France and were imprisoned for a short time at La Bastille, in Paris, before being freed as they were found to be innocent. Then, in April 1684, Louis XIV decided to name them captains and each led a company of the seven that were sent to New France in that year. Despite their difficulty to adapt to the Canadian cold climate, they were among the most brave and capable officers in Canada as confirmed in several letters sent by the Governors of New France to Versailles. In 1686, they took part with governor de Denonville in the expedition against the Iroquois at Niagara. In 1692, Antoine was given charge of the troops at Sault-Saint-Louis and was able to fend off an attack by 800 Iroquois. In 1696, Thomas died, leaving a very good memory for his personal qualities. Very close to Governor de Calliere, Antoine Crisafy was named king's lieutenant at Montreal in 1697 and, the following year, became a knight in the order of Saint-Louis. In 1699, he was named king's lieutenant at Quebec City. He married Marie-Claire, the daughter of François-Madeleine-Fortuné Ruette d'Auteuil de Monceaux in 1700. Following the death of François Provost, he became governor at Trois-Rivières. Crisafy died in office and was buried there on May 6, 1709. Neither Antoine nor Thomas had children and they did not become French citizens."

  "text" : "Arnaldo De Lisio (December 9, 1869 – 1949) was an Italian painter. He was born in Castelbottaccio, Molise. His style was influenced by the works of Domenico Morelli, Ignazio Perrici, and Toma. He traveled to Paris with Pietro Scoppetta and Ragione at the turn of the century, where he was influenced by Impressionism and completed colorful paintings of urban vistas. He returned to Italy and painted also portratist and genre scenes. He painted frescoes for the Banca d'Italia and Istituto Pilla of Campobasso, the Sanctuary of Campiglione di Caivano in 1938, and the ceiling of the Teatro Savoia in Campobasso."

He is one of six judges whom human rights organizations have highlighted as being the instruments of a crackdown on journalists and political activists under the influence of Iran's intelligence and security apparatus. Besides Salavati, the other revolutionary court judges include Mohammad Moghiseh, former justices Yahya Pirabbasi and Hassan Zareh Dehnavi (known as judge Haddad), and appeal judges Hassan Babaee and Ahmad Zargar. The six judges are accused of overseeing miscarriages of justice in trials in which journalists, lawyers, political activists and members of Iran's ethnic and religious minorities have been condemned to lengthy prison terms, lashes and even execution."

As an Australian citizen she required a visa from France to take up her seat at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

In 2013, he was awarded the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) Dud Perkins Lifetime Achievement Award for his \"generous and tireless support of motorcycling\" with his business and nonprofit activities, and contributions as an AMA board member. Goldfine created the Aerostich Roadcrafter suit c. 1982, noted as \"the first synthetic textile armored riding suit\", made with Cordura and \"worn by almost every motorcycle journalist when they're really riding\". Goldfine has been called \"one of the early leaders and innovators in motorcycle safety clothing\", and \"a revolutionary — a guy who changed the motorcycling world\". Cycle World said \"if there is ever a motorcycle gear hall of fame, Andy Goldfine should be inducted.\" Author Melissa Holbrook Pierson has noted Goldfine's contribution to motorcycling by holding that it is a social good, and he has been cited as an expert on motorcycling culture as expressed through rider clothing. In 1996, Goldfine undertook a 17,000-mile (27,000 km) long-distance motorcycling journey from his home city, Duluth MN, to Mongolia, crossing Siberia and returning via China and Japan. This ride with partner Helge Pedersen was part of a much longer journey Pedersen took, documented in his book 10 Years on 2 Wheels."

From 1859 to 1905 he was the rector of St Aldate's Church in Oxford, where he supervised a substantial expansion of the church, and from 1886 to his death he was an honorary canon of Christ Church, Oxford.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Cheglakov qualified as a 30-year-old for the men's 96 kg class by receiving a berth and a bronze medal from the Asian Championships in Almaty, Kazakhstan. He scored a total of six technical points to beat Latvia's Igors Kostins, but ended his Olympic campaign with a dramatic defeat against Turkey's Mehmet Özal, who later continued his quest to take home the bronze medal, finishing second only in the preliminary pool, and fourteenth in the final rankings."

  "text" : "Sir Arthur Wilson, KCIE, PC, (1837 - 1915) was an English lawyer and judge. After practising as a barrister in the English courts, he served as a judge of the High Court of Calcutta, and was later a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Wilson was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1862 and rapidly advanced in the profession. One judge of the English High Court, Lord Justice Mathew, said that Wilson would certainly have been raised to the bench in Britain, had he not accepted an appointment to the High Court of Calcutta in 1878 (at that time, known as the High Court of Judicature, Fort Williams, Bengal). In 1880, Wilson was elected Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta, a position he held until 1884. In 1888-89, Wilson was president of a Commission of Inquiry which sat at Poona, to investigate corruption allegations which had been made against Arthur Crawford, the Commissioner of the Central Division of the Bombay Presidency. The lengthy hearings attracted considerable public attention in both India and Britain. After sixty-seven public sittings, the Commission found Crawford not guilty of the more serious charges of taking bribes, but guilty of borrowing money from his Indian subordinates. In 1892, Wilson resigned his position on the Calcutta High Court and returned to Britain. He was appointed Legal Adviser and Solicitor to the Indian Office, and in 1898 was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE). In March 1902, Wilson was sworn a member of the Privy Council, and the following month took his place on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court for the Empire. By that time, he was physically weak, having trouble even walking across the room at committee meetings, but he retained his intellectual vigour. He sat on the Judicial Committee for nine years, retiring in 1911. Wilson had a family of two sons and one daughter. Both sons were in the Army. One of them was drowned while crossing a river in India, and the other was killed campaigning in South Africa. Wilson died on 28 December 1915, at the Moorings, Heathside, Woking."

In 1116, Abu'l-Fath was appointed by Arslan-Shah as his vizier, where Abu'l-Fath became highly influential and gained much power. However, this was short-lived; one year later, Arslan-Shah's brother Bahram-Shah, with the aid of the Seljuq Sultan Ahmad Sanjar, defeated and killed Arslan-Shah, and Bahram-Shah then took control over the Ghaznavid Empire. Abu'l-Fath fell from favor after Arslan-Shah's death, and probably shared the same fate as the latter."

Nakaya offered a distinctively analytical approach to reviewing cars on the show, providing detailed analyses of various vehicle components and explaining certain driving styles that were best suited to their characteristics. He was a regular driver of Mitsubishi Lancer Evolutions during Best Motoring races involving the I, II, III, IV, V, VI, Makinen editions, VII, and VIII of the car, often recording lap times significantly quicker than other drivers of the same vehicle. Nakaya's name was applied to a special preface-build of the Mitsubishi FTO – the Nakaya-Tune FTO, which appeared in 1997. Nakaya was considered for a Formula One ride with Brabham in 1992, but the FIA would not grant him a superlicense on the grounds that Japanese F3000 was not considered a stepping stone to F1. The ride eventually went to Giovanna Amati, who was more known for her wealth than talent."

His father had entered the lumber business by 1877 and, in 1884, Archibald and his brother Donald Jr. joined the family business. In 1917, they formed Fraser Companies Limited. The business expanded to include sawmills in New Brunswick and Quebec and sulphite pulp mills in Edmundston and Chatham. Fraser also served as a director of the Royal Bank of Canada, the New Brunswick Telephone Company, the Maritime Trust Company of Saint John and the Rolland Paper Company (now a division of Cascades). He was married twice: first to Agnes Dunbar in 1902 (she died in 1911) and then, in 1930, to Evelyn Whyte. Fraser died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 63 on a holiday weekend at his hunting lodge near Nictau in Victoria County, New Brunswick.

  "text" : "Ayatollah Abdol-Hamid Masoumi-Tehrani is an Iranian cleric based in Tehran, Iran. Masoumi-Tehrani was born in Tehran to a distinguished cleric family and attained the rank of Marja al-Taqlid or a \"source of emulation\" in 1988. Masoumi-Tehrani is an accomplished calligrapher and spends much of his time engaged in this profession as he believes that money should not be made through religion. He strongly advocates human rights for all regardless of religious ideology or belief and has created in calligraphy form the Torah, Psalms and Quran to foster unity amongst religions. Masoumi-Tehrani has been pressured by authorities, detained, and imprisoned on various occasions, starting when he was 23. He claims to have been questioned even by agents of reformist president Mohammad Khatami regarding his project to publish calligraphy of the Torah, and that beginning in 2004 he received threats connected to his similar project for the Psalms. In April 2014, as a mark of solidarity with the Bahá'í community of Iran, the largest religious minority in the country, he gifted the Bahá'ís of the world a calligraphy work from the writings of Bahá'u'lláh, the prophet founder of the Bahá'í Faith, which states: \"Consort with all religions with amity and concord, that they may inhale from you the sweet fragrance of God. Beware lest amidst men the flame of foolish ignorance overpower you. All things proceed from God and unto Him they return. He is the source of all things and in Him all things are ended.\"  The Ayatollah's call for religious tolerance and co-existence has received worldwide support from religious leaders. In November 2015, Masoumi-Tehrani gave 15 recently arrested Bahá'ís in Iran another calligraphy work he produced. It featured a quotation from The Hidden Words, one of the Baha'i Faith's sacred texts: \"O Son Of Man! Ponder and reflect. Is it thy wish to die upon thy bed, or to shed thy life-blood on the dust, a martyr in My path, and so become the manifestation of My command and the revealer of My light in the highest paradise? Judge thou aright, O servant!\"  He said he wished to raise awareness among Iranians about the dignity of people regardless of religion."

  "text" : "Alfred Green Wheelock (born May 14, 1912 in Johnson City, Tennessee), was the son of Sam Wheelock and Carrie Ledford, local store merchants. Alfred married Juanita Rosenbaum and later married Lorena Barnes. Alfred's young life involved running corn liquor in the hills of East Tennessee where he and his brothers met Al Capone sometime between 1928 and 1931. The moonshine business was booming and all trains on the east coast ran through Little Chicago. Johnson City was a meeting place for many mob bosses to do business because it was a halfway point from Chicago to Miami and is believed the nickname Little Chigago was given by the mobsters. During this time, Alfred, and his brothers Don and Sam (Bruce), were invited into the world of organized crime running corn liquor, brothels and private road houses. It was handed down from Alfred to family members that Al Capone wanted Alfred and brothers to start dealing drugs Reefer Madness in the area of East Tennessee and Alfred declined to do so. Because of this, it is believed* by the brothers that some of Al Capone's men had Alfred and Bruce framed for larceny and armed robbery. Alfred and Bruce did 4 years in the Brushy Mountain State penitentiary in Tennessee. Alfred was also charged with possession and sale of corn whiskey."

Conlon had been a founding member of the Women's Electoral Lobby in 1972 and that year contested a by-election for the state seat of Mosman for the Labor Party, without success. She convened the WEL's first national conference in 1973. In 1975 she was awarded a grant by the Australian National Advisory Committee of International Women's Year, expanding her research with Edna Ryan into a book, Gentle Invaders. She became a lecturer at the Australian Trade Union Training Authority in 1976 and was a founding member of the New South Wales Women's Advisory Council in 1977. She was appointed by the state Labor government as a special projects officer with the Women's Coordination Unit in 1978. She was divorced in January 1979, and six months later was diagnosed with cancer. She died on 13 December 1979 in North Sydney. A building at the Mulawa Training and Detention Centre for Women and an annual lecture sponsored by the Women's Advisory Council are named in her memory."

  "text" : "Ali ibn Kama, the uncle of the Buyid ruler Rukn al-Dawla and the latter's other brothers Mu'izz al-Dawla and Imad al-Dawla, was a Buyid military officer who became prominent among the Buyids of Jibal, and was greatly honored among his Daylamite kinsmen. At the death of Imad al-Dawla in 949, Ali was appointed as the viceroy of Ray by Rukn al-Dawla, who went to Shiraz to secure the succession of his son there, Adud al-Dawla. Meanwhile, the Samanids used this opportunity to invade the territories of Rukn al-Dawla, forcing Ali to flee from Jibal. In ca. 959, a battle ensured between Ali and the Ziyarid prince Bisutun, which resulted in a Buyid victory. In 966, Ali and Rukn al-Dawla defeated a large force of ghazis who had arrived from Khorasan. Rukn al-Dawla later died in 976 and was succeeded by his son Fakhr al-Dawla, who had Ali executed."

Roe served the spy ring as a courier by secretly relaying its messages across the 55 miles that separated the spy ring's two centers of operation, Setauket, New York and New York City. During this time Long Island and New York City were both occupied by the British. Austin Roe claimed to be conducting business as a merchant in order to avoid suspicion. Having over the course of the Revolution rode over 1000 miles swiftly on horseback, he has been called The Paul Revere of Long Island. Austin Roe was also the owner of Roe's Tavern in East Setauket, an extant structure (now a private residence) where George Washington stayed overnight during his 1790 tour of Long Island. In 2015, a letter from a loyalist soldier was uncovered identifying brothers Nathaniel and Phillip Roe as also assisting the Culper Ring ."

  "text" : "Arne Svendsen (11 December 1884 – 20 November 1958) was a Norwegian songwriter, folk poet and revue writer. He was born in Fosnes in Nord-Trøndelag, Norway. In 1910, he left home and settled in Fredrikstad, where he first worked as a hairdresser and barber. In 1911, he wrote his first revue for the Fredrikstad Arbeiderforening, followed by five new revues annually until 1920. From 1921, Svendsen was associated with Chat Noir, a cabaret and revue theatre in Oslo. He wrote the revue, Midt i planeten together with Per Kvist in 1922. He also collaborated with song writer Finn Bo (1927-36). From 1937 he worked with teams of various revue writers including Bias Bernhoft, Arild Feldborg and Erik Diesen. They wrote music for revues which appeared at Det Nye Teater, Carl Johan Teatret and Edderkoppen Theatre, and with more irregular intervals for Chat Noir. He was for many years chairman of the Norwegian Comedy Writers' Association. Svendsen wrote more than 2,500 songs during his career, in addition to more than one hundred revues. Among his notable songs were Svigermor og Evensen og kjerringa og jeg (1927), first performed by Einar Rose, En liten gylden ring (1936), sung by Jens Book Jensen, and E'hel ei, e'halv ei (1955), introduced by Lalla Carlsen in the Chat Noir revue Kjør Storgata. He was married at age 19 to Jenny Claudine Andersen (1876-1953). That marriage was dissolved in 1933 and he married Lilly Margrethe Andersen (1902-1996). He was the father of composer and organizer Allison Svendsen (1903-1976) and singer and theatre director Herbert Herding-Herberth (1904-1958)."

  "text" : "Aleksi \"Alex\" Modebadze (Georgian: ალექსი მოდებაძე; born February 21, 1978 in Tbilisi) is a retired amateur Georgian freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's super heavyweight category. He represented his nation Georgia in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), and later claimed three career medals at the European Championships. Modebadze also trained for Shevardeni Wrestling Club in Tbilisi under his personal coach Zaza Turmanidze. Modebadze made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's super heavyweight division (130 kg). He eclipsed Greece's Efstathios Topalidis on his opening bout with a striking effort, but could not pin Iranian wrestler and 1999 world champion Abbas Jadidi into the ring without collecting a single point. Finishing second in the prelim pool and tenth in the overall rankings, Modebadze fell short to earn a spot for the quarterfinals. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Modebadze qualified for his second Georgian squad in the men's 120 kg class by receiving a berth and achieving a top eight finish from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States. Modebadze managed to score a single triumph over Hungary's Ottó Aubéli with a five-point advantage, but he was thrown powerfully by Russian wrestler and 1997 world champion Kuramagomed Kuramagomedov in overtime to end his Olympic campaign with a second-place effort in the prelim pool and fourteenth in the overall rankings."

Lester's gloomy stage persona was seen to its quintessential comic effect in the long-running musical The Arcadians (1909) in which he delivered optimistic lyrics in a lugubrious manner. Among his other hit shows were The New Aladdin (1906), Havana (1908) and The Bing Boys Are Here (1916). His co-stars included George Grossmith Jr., Phyllis Dare, George Robey and Violet Lorraine. Ill health brought Lester's career to a premature close, and he died of pneumonia at the age of fifty."

  "text" : "Aleksandr Shemarov (also Aliaksandr Shamarau, Belarusian: Аляксандр Шамараў; born April 9, 1975 in Kaliningrad, Russian SFSR) is a retired amateur Belarusian freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's heavyweight category. He won a bronze medal in the 97-kg division at the 2001 European Championships in Budapest, Hungary, and also achieved a seventh-place finish each in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Shemarov trained as a member of the freestyle wrestling team for Minsk Trade Union Sports Club, under his father and coach Nikolai Shemarov. Shemarov made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's heavyweight division (97 kg). He scored a set of two triumphs to defeat Canada's Dean Schmeichel and Slovak-born Australian wrestler Gabriel Szerda in the opening matches, but suffered a formidable 2–3 overtime defeat against Poland's three-time Olympian Marek Garmulewicz. Finishing second in the prelim pool and seventh overall, Shemarov's performance fell short to put him further into the quarterfinals. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Shemarov qualified for his second Belarusian squad, as a 29-year-old, in the men's heavyweight class (96 kg) by rounding out the top ten spot and receiving a berth from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States. Shemarov delivered a more powerful effort from his previous Games by thrashing Turkey's Fatih Çakıroğlu and Mongolia's Tüvshintöriin Enkhtuyaa to secure a spot for the next round. Fighting against Russian wrestler and European champion Khadzhimurat Gatsalov in the quarterfinal match, Shemarov could not score a single point to push him off the mat, and instead, matched his final standing from Sydney in the process. Shortly after the Games, Shemarov officially retired from his sporting career, and became a personal coach for his younger brother Alexei, who later competed in the men's super heavyweight division at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London."

Chekhauskoi qualified for the Belarusian squad in the men's super heavyweight class (120 kg) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by receiving an allocated place from the International Wrestling Federation (French: Fédération Internationale des Luttes Associées, FILA). Chekhauskoi suffered through a vulnerable game plan as he was immediately overpowered by Czech Republic's David Vála and could not recover his from after losing out to Russian wrestler and 2003 world champion Khasan Baroyev on his second bout, finishing third in the prelim pool and eighteenth in the overall rankings without acquiring a single point."

In 1854, Kenner purchased slave jockey Abe Hawkins. Abe was considered small and of \"light figure\" and suited to being a jockey. Abe rode for Kenner until he became a freeman in 1864, and then for Robert A. Alexander and was nationally known for fifteen years. By 1865, Abe was rated the second best known athlete behind white jockey Gilbert Watson Partrick, known as Gilpatrick, and won against him in a match race before a crowd of 25,000 in New York City. Abe had a career twenty-five wins, including the two 1866 wins while under the employ of Robert A. Alexander, the Travers Stakes riding Merrill with former slave trainer Ansel Williamson, and the first Jerome Stakes riding Watson with trainer Jacob Pincus. Abe returned to Ashland in 1866 and lived there until he died on May 4, 1867."

  "text" : "Andrew J. Elliot (born 1962) is a professor of psychology at the University of Rochester. His research on the hierarchical model of approach and avoidance motivation focuses on combining classic and contemporary methods to test various theories. Elliot's work in social psychology is cited frequently by those in the field, causing him to be named one of Thomson Reuters' ISI Highly Cited for the Social Sciences in 2010. Elliot received his B.A in 1985 at Taylor University in Indiana, and then went on to secure a Ph.D. in Social-Personality Psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1994. He has served on the editorial boards of multiple psychological journals, and he is currently consulting editor to the Journal of Educational Psychology, the Journal of Personality, and the Personality and Social Psychology Review. He was also the Churchill Fellow at Cambridge University in 2010, and has served as the Visiting Senior Fellow at Jesus College in Oxford University during the 2013-2014 academic year. He was awarded the 2003 Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research award for mid-career contributions to Psychology, and 2013 Ed and Carol Diener Award for Outstanding Contributions to Personality Psychology. He is the recipient of several grants to continue his work from many research foundations including Institute of Education Sciences and the Humboldt Foundation. Elliot’s research focuses have had many different facets, although his primary focus is on achievement and avoidance motivation. His most prominent study related to color psychology, and came to the conclusions that the color red on women made them more attractive to men than any other color."

  "text" : "Alfred M. Wall (1890–2 October 1957) was a British trade unionist and political activist. Born in Shropshire, Wall moved to London to work as a compositor, and was a member of the British Socialist Party (BSP). This affiliated to the Labour Party after World War I, and Wall was unexpectedly elected to Wandsworth Metropolitan Borough Council for Clapham North in 1918. In this role, he frequently clashed with the local socialist preacher and pioneer druid George Watson Macgregor Reid. He was also sympathetic to anarchism, and chaired the Frank Kitz Appeal Committee. Wall represented the BSP's Clapham branch at the meeting which founded the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and subsequently sat as a Communist councillor. Initially one of the communist's main speakers in London, he stood as a joint Communist Party-Labour Party candidate in Streatham at the 1924 general election, taking 13.8% of the vote. Wall represented the London Society of Compositors at the Labour Party conference in 1925, and eventually defected to the party, although he was still a communist in 1927, when he became a joint secretary of the \"Hands Off China\" campaign. In 1926, he was elected as Secretary of the London Trades Council. While holding this position, he spent much of his time promoting a trade union for actors, based on a closed shop principle. This became Equity, and he was elected as its first secretary. Later in the 1930s, he also served as a vice-president of the Spanish Medical Aid Committee, In 1938, Wall was elected as General Secretary of the London Society of Compositors, and stood down from the London Trades Council. During World War II, he served on the National Arbitration Union, and on Lord Swinton's Security Executive. Wall retired from his union posts in 1945, but worked for a while as the secretary and welfare officer of C. and E. Layton."

His first Grand Prix victory, he won in France at Paul Ricard in 1977, with Gérard Lecorre as a passenger.

In 1700, the electress wished to separate from the elector because of this affair, but managed to reconcile. The same year, the elector and electress returned to Bavaria. Le Louchier was given an assignment as a spy by the elector and sent to Paris to make use of political connections in favor of Bavarian interests.

  "text" : "Sir Amyas Charles Edward Morse, KCB, is a British auditor who is the current Comptroller and Auditor General of the National Audit Office, an independent Parliamentary body. Morse led the Coopers and Lybrand practice in Scotland before moving to London to manage the London City Office, subsequently becoming executive partner of Coopers and Lybrand UK. He was a global managing partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers before he was named Comptroller and Auditor General, succeeding Tim Burr. Sir Amyas is responsible to the Public Accounts Commission, a Commons committee, for actions taken over the extent of audit scrutiny over public bodies. In 2015 alone there were over 400 accounts certified in law which produced 60 major policy outcomes. In conjunction with evidence sessions and 40 regular meetings with Parliament, the transparency of publications is designed to be timely, relevant and material to future recommendations on issues as wide-ranging as local government, devolution, NGOs, NSDAPs (Non-Statutory Departmental bodies), many of which since 2010 have been foreclosed in reorganization and budgetary cuts. The Commission does not make policy, but it does have a significant input to Treasury decision-making. Sir Amyas has discussed technical difficulties on building an \"Accountability model\" upon the organizational integrity of which the Government might rely to deliver efficiencies. All expenditure must be made by parliamentary votes and therefore totally demands a record of the method and manner in which the money is spent. Modern Conservatism has required more contracting-out of public services and the use of digital \"transformational models\" to convert all services to internet transmission. Commercial contracting would include impact on flagship projects such as the \"Northern Powerhouse\" by linking local to central government through private industry's management processes. Morse has challenged government thinking on the extent to which cuts fails to take proper account of risk management. One controversial area had been the NHS cuts affecting striking Junior Doctors, a manifestation of current unhappiness over what he labelled as \"optimism bias\" over the Prime Minister's elision over the process of coping mechanisms to be deployed, and the impact of those changes. Deeper cuts have come at a time in the reduction of \"middle-class\" higher rate of taxation and inheritance taxes, undermining the moral imperative of \"more profound organizational cuts\" to the NHS. On a personal note about \"accountability\" he asked the committees where the NAO might sit in respect vis a vis the Scottish Parliament, and resource implications. He had added that he needs to be a \"detector\" as to what is going on; both \"careful and stringent.\" In 2016 the NAO made 20 corporate redundancies, and another 10 in the audit department in the London office. The Government required the NAO to make a minimum of £1 million efficiency savings. Analysis, digitization and rigorous proven procedures have consistently tightened budgetary constraints and reduced contingency funding. Sir Amyas Morse is a strong believer in \"long-term planning\" in management and non-political work activity. He was at pains to stress in March 2016 pre-budget scrutiny that the NAO must examine \"the business case\" to add value to public projects. One such example he has pointed to has been the elimination of mistakes achieved by scrutinizing the HS2 portfolio before its pre-launch date."

The game was later ported to multiple platforms. Polygon included Vollmer in their \"50 admirable gaming people\" of the year for his work on Threes. Among other projects, Vollmer subsequently worked on Close Castles, a real-time strategy game later put on hiatus, and Royals, a simulation game for OS X and Windows."

  "text" : "Ada Blanche (16 July 1862 – 1 January 1953), born Ada Cecilia Blanche Adams, was an English actress and singer known early in her career for vivacious performances in Victorian burlesque and pantomime and later in character roles in Edwardian musical comedy. Born into a theatrical family, Blanche made her stage debut at the age of fourteen and had a forty-five year career, almost exclusively on the British stage, in the West End and on tour. In the 1890s she was a leading principal boy in London's most lavishly staged pantomimes. In the 20th century her career changed to playing comic, formidable older women. Her most celebrated role of this kind was in the hit musical The Arcadians (1909), staged by her brother-in-law Robert Courtneidge. Beyond musical comedy, Blanche appeared in farces and other comedies in non-singing roles between 1906 and her retirement in 1921. Among her co-stars during her long career were George Grossmith Jr., Dan Leno, Marie Lloyd, Walter Passmore, Kate Santley and Little Tich."

She was the student of Louis Marteau, Marcello Bacciarelli and likely Jean-Baptiste Greuze. The purpose of the Polish monarch for paying for her education was that she should return to Poland and become a professor of art, but she chose to remain in Paris after her marriage in 1788. In 1791, she became the first Polish female to have her work represented at the Paris art exhibition. During the Reign of Terror, she fled from Paris to Clermont-Ferrand. She became blind in 1824. Anna Rajecka painted the circle around the Polish royal court in Poland, and was commissioned by the local Paris aristocracy after her move to France. She performed mainly portraits, both drawings and paintings in soft pastel."

A preliminary medical examination indicated that the infant died from head trauma. The police interrogated Thomas for nearly 10 hours during which he confessed to throwing his son on the bed three times. The entire interrogation was videotaped. He was charged with second-degree murder, found guilty, and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. In 2011, Grover Babcock and Blue Hadaegh were looking for an example of a coerced confession as the basis for a documentary film they were planning and they used Thomas' interrogation video to make the documentary Scenes of a Crime. Thomas appealed his conviction based on a coercive interrogation, however, the state appellate justices of New York denied his appeal in 2012. Thomas then appealed his conviction to the New York Court of Appeals. In February 2014, the seven judges unanimously ruled that Thomas must have another trial excluding the videotaped confession. A second trial was held and on June 12, 2014, the jury found him not guilty of second degree murder of his infant son. The case created controversy about how much coercion is legally permissible in police interrogations."

  "text" : "Alexander Urquhart (died 1727) was a Scottish officer in the British Army and a Jacobite politician. He sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1715 to 1727, and died bankrupt after his financial speculation failed. Urquhart was the oldest son of John Urquhart of Newhall and his wife Jean, daughter of Colin Mackenzie of Redcastle, Ross-shire. He was a brother-in-law Sir Kenneth Mackenzie MP. He had a brief career in the army, being commissioned in 1708 as an ensign in the 15th Foot. He was promoted to the rank of captain in Stanwix's Foot in 1710, and retired on half-pay in 1714. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Cromartyshire from 1715 to 1722, and for Ross-shire from 1722 to 1727.He speculated heavily during the South Sea Bubble, and used his parliamentary privilege to shield himself from his creditors. He was forced to waive the immunity, and was successfully sued; he died bankrupt."

  "text" : "Alexandru I. Philippide (May 1, 1859 – August 12, 1933) was a Romanian linguist and philologist. Educated in Iași and Halle, he taught high school for several years until 1893, when he secured a professorship at the University of Iași that he would hold until his death forty years later. He began publishing books on the Romanian language around the time he graduated university, but it was not until he became a professor that he drew wider attention, thanks to a study of the language's history. Although not particularly ideological, he penned sharp, witty polemics directed at various intellectual figures, both at home and, in one noted case, in Germany. In 1898, Philippide began work on a Romanian dictionary; by 1906, he and his team had completed the first four letters of the alphabet before others took over the task. His major work, which appeared in two hefty volumes in 1925 and 1928, brings together a wide range of ancient sources and linguistic evidence to analyze the ethnogenesis of the Romanians and the development of their language. Although attacked for parochialism by one set of academics, the students he trained carried forth his ideas by forming the core of an Iași-based linguistic school."

  "text" : "Alim Sherzamonov is a politician in Tajikistan. On June 16, 2014, individuals who identified themselves as Tajikistan government security officials apprehended Alex Sodiqov Political Science PhD candidate at the University of Toronto, during an interview with Sherzamanov. Sherzamonov is credited with playing a leadership role during political unrest in Khorog, the capital of the autonomous republic of Gorno-Badakhshan, in 2012.Human Rights Watch describes Sherzamonov as a \"civil society activist\".Academics at the University of Exeter would say Sodiqov was interviewing Sherzamonov as part of a study of failures of conflict management in former Republics of the Soviet Union. The whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published a diplomatic cable from United States Ambassador Tracey A. Jacobson, which said Sherzamonov was the \"local representative of the Social Democratic Party\".Jacobson reported that Sherzamonov had played a role in getting protesters to disperse. Kirgizbek Kanunov, writing in CACI Analyst asserted that Tajikistan's National Security Committee, the KNB, had described Sodiqov as an agent for a foreign government, who was negotiating with Sherzamonov on their behalf.CTV News reported Sherzamonov claimed security officials had planned to arrest him, as well. Global Voices, a site Sodiqov has contributed to, reported that Security Officials had broadcast footage of Sodiqov, that seemed intended to discredit Sheramonov. Sherzamonov has acknowledged playing a role in demonstrations during the summer of 2012, but he insists his role was peaceful and non-violent."

  "text" : "Alfons Karabuda, born 2 December 1967 in Stockholm, Sweden, is a Swedish composer and EU cultural politics personality. Karabuda is the acting CEO of STIM (the Swedish Performing Rights Society), president of ECSA (European Composer and Songwriter Alliance), executive chairman of SKAP – Sveriges kompositörer och textförfattare (the Swedish Association of Composers, Songwriters & Lyricists) and expert in the field of artistic rights to the UN Human Rights Council. He is a member of the executive board at IMC (International Music Council), Statens Musikverks konstnärliga råd (The Artistic Board of Music Development and Heritage Sweden), Musiksverige (Musicsweden), STIM (The Swedish Performing Rights Society) and Svensk Musik (Swedish Music). Karabuda is also chairman of the Polar Music Prize Award. As expert to the UN Human Rights Council, Karabuda was part of producing the first ever UNHRC report on artistic rights in 2013. The report was followed by new reports during 2014. As the president of ECSA, Karabuda has been a driving force in the formation of a European–American collaboration between the music creator organisations ECSA and SGA (Songwriters Guild of America). Together, the organisations have focused on the global issues of artistic rights, free speech and authors' rights (in America, copyright), in joint actions such as the Fair Trade Music Initiative. As a member of the executive board of STIM, and during 2014 as acting CEO, Karabuda has focused on developing international strategy, improving distribution systems and adjusting the organization to the new EU directive on collective rights management. Karabuda's parents, Günes and Barbro Karabuda, are journalists and filmmakers. His sister Denize Karabuda is an actor and director. The Karabuda children grew up traveling during their parents' many assignments, to which Karabuda himself credits his cultural political involvement. Karabuda works in the areas of TV, film and theatre through his publishing company Naomi Musikförlag & Filmproduktion. Among his customers are SVT, SR, BBC, Zentropa and Stockholms Stadsteater. Karabuda also composes music for commercials."

  "text" : "Alexandru A. Philippide (April 1, 1900 – February 8, 1979) was a Romanian poet. The son of linguist Alexandru Philippide, he was born in Iași. He studied law, literature, philosophy and political economy at the University of Iași, of Berlin and of Paris. Making his poetry debut in 1919, he published rarely, with volumes appearing in 1922, 1930 and 1939. Thus, his decision to enter an artistic strike after the onset of the Communist regime passed unnoticed. During this period, he translated or improved texts by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, E. T. A. Hoffmann, Heinrich Heine, Thomas Mann, Voltaire, William Shakespeare, Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore and many others. He was not an open dissident, accepting corresponding membership in the Romanian Academy in 1955 and titular membership in 1963. Once the socialist realist phase had passed, he began writing poetry again. He was buried in Bellu cemetery in Bucharest. A street in Bucharest bears his name. Initially called Pia Brătianu, it was renamed after Olga Bancic under communism and given Philippide's name following the Romanian Revolution."

However, in 1963, he played only 4 games for the Argos. He went to the Edmonton Eskimos, where he played 8 games and obtained 16 catches for 200 yards and a 12.5 yards per catch average. He also served as the Eskimos'punter: 43 punts for a 40.7 yards per punt average, a top one of 73 yards and 2 single points. However, he was replaced as the punter the following year by Marcel Deleeuw and never played again. He was probably the tallest player in the CFL at that time at 6 feet 7 inches."

  "text" : "Aubrey William Ingleton (1920–2000) was an English mathematician. Ingleton was born in Chester, the son of an accountant. He joined the civil service at age 16, and during World War II was seconded to a radar development project. After the war, he entered Northern Polytechnic, and earned a B.Sc. in mathematics in 1949 as an external student at the University of London, winning first class honours, the Lubbock Prize, and the Sherbrooke Prize. He did his graduate studies in mathematics at King's College London under the supervision of Anthony Francis Ruston, on subjects related to the Hahn–Banach theorem. He took a faculty position at Birkbeck College in 1951, and married in 1952. In 1961 he moved to New College, Oxford, as the Mathematics Tutor. In 1966 he took up a Chair in Pure Mathematics at Cardiff University, but he returned to Oxford in 1967, becoming a fellow of Balliol College, where he remained for the rest of his career. Among his students at Oxford was Paul Seymour. As a mathematician his works are related to many different topics in Analysis, Geometry, Algebra, Topology, Combinatorics and Algebraic Geometry. His work on matroids culminated in the paper \"Representation of matroids\" published in 1969. In his work Ingleton studied matroids as a generalization of the concept of linear independence. The paper is a survey about representable matroids as it exhibited matroids representable over C but not over R and similarly over R but not over Q. He included in his paper a single theorem which is a necessary condition of the representability of matroids. This condition is known in the literature as Ingleton's Inequality."

In 2014 she became a professional runner for New Balance. At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she received considerable international media attention following an incident during a 5000m heat in which both she and New Zealander Nikki Hamblin fell. The two women helped each other finish the race and were allowed to compete in the final; however, D'Agostino had suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus and wasn't able to participate further. Both athletes were praised for their sportsmanship and \"olympic spirit\", and were subsequently awarded the Rio 2016 Fair Play Award by the International Fair Play Committee."

Morley owned the Victoria Coffee & Spice Mills until 1909. Morley was elected in part due to a rising demand for moral reform in Victoria. After he was elected, Morley and the police chief struck an unofficial deal with Stella Carroll, a popular \"madam\" in the city. If she would move her brothel out of downtown and into what was considered the town's \"red-light district\", she would be left alone. However, public pressure forced the mayor to renege on this deal. He died in Victoria at the age of 96."

Born into a wealthy family Gonzaga had a passion for cinema from an early age, and first appeared on screen in a short advertising film in 1920. He worked as a journalist for the film magazine Cinearte (1926–1942) which advocated the creation of a more professional, commercial film industry in Brazil. In 1928 he directed his first film, a silent. The film was a strong commercial success, and on the strength of it Gonzaga persuaded his father to financially back a film studio. After a period of study in Hollywood, Gonzaga returned to Brazil and founded Cinédia a Rio de Janeiro-based company which quickly became the leading studio in Brazil. Cinédia specialised in producing Chanchadas, musical comedies with a populist appeal which often featured leading stage and singing stars. Chanchadas produced during Gonzaga's reign included Hello, Hello Brazil! (1935), Hello, Hello, Carnival! (1936) and Samba in Berlin (1943). Many of Brazil's major stars appeared in Cinédia productions, including Carmen Miranda. The studio remained in continual operation until 1951."

  "text" : "Anuj Kumar Chaudhary (Hindi: अनुज कुमार; born August 5, 1980) is a retired amateur Indian freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's light heavyweight category.

Before his sporting career ended in 2010, Kumar trained full-time for Subash Varma Wrestling Club in his native New Delhi, under his coach and mentor Subash Varma. Kumar reached sporting headlines at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, where he claimed a silver medal in the 84-kg division, losing out to Canada's Nicholas Ugoalah by a tough 4–1 verdict. On that same year, he competed for the Indian wrestling team at the Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, but left the tournament empty-handed and injured. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Kumar qualified for his first Indian squad in the men's 84 kg class. Earlier in the process, he placed third and guaranteed a spot on the Indian wrestling team from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria. He lost two straight matches each to Iran's Majid Khodaei (1–5) and Japan's Hidekazu Yokoyama (5–11), leaving him on the bottom of the prelim pool and placing sixteenth in the final standings. Shortly after the Games, Kumar ended his medal drought by picking up a bronze at the 2005 Asian Wrestling Championships in Wuhan, China, and continued to repeat the same outcome in Pattaya, Thailand four years later. He also sought his bid to compete for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, but failed to attain the bid from the Olympic Tournament. When India hosted the 2010 Commonwealth Games in his native New Delhi, Kumar lost his final match to neighboring Pakistan's Muhammad Inam by a 4–3 decision, and received a silver medal with his home crowd inside Indira Gandhi Arena. Following another medal record, Kumar retired from competitive wrestling career to focus on his personal life."

  "text" : "Ali Ashkani Aghbolagh (Persian: علی اشکانی آق بلاغ‎‎; born November 16, 1978 in Ardabil) is a retired amateur Iranian Greco-Roman wrestler and currently coach of Iranian Greco-Roman wrestling, who competed in the men's lightweight category. He won four Asian Championship medals (three golds and one silver), picked up a silver in the 60-kg division at the 2005 World Wrestling Championships in Budapest, Hungary, and represented Iran in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), finishing fifth in Sydney and eleventh in Athens respectively. Throughout his sporting career, Ashkani trained full-time for Takhti Wrestling Club in Ardabil under his coach and mentor jafar Damirchi. Ashkani reached sporting headlines at the 2000 Asian Wrestling Championships in Seoul, South Korea, where he won his first title in the 58-kg division over Uzbekistan's Dilshod Aripov. A few months later, Ashkani entered the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as a dark horse in the men's featherweight category (58 kg). He dominated the field by thrashing Hungary's István Majoros (1–5) and Georgia's Koba Guliashvili in the prelim pool to secure his place in the next round of the tournament. Ashkani lost the quarterfinal match to eventual silver medalist Kim In-Sub of South Korea with a powerful 3–1 decision, but bounced back to turn down U.S. wrestler Jim Gruenwald on the mat 3–2 for a fifth-place finish. After his first Olympics, Ashkani proved particularly successful in his career with two more medals in both 58 and 60-kg division at the Asian Championships (2001 and 2003). Determined to return to the wrestling scene and medal, Ashkani emerged himself as a top medal favorite at the 2002 Asian Games in South Korea, but lost to Kazakhstan's Nurlan Koizhaiganov in the quarterfinal match 4–1. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Ashkani qualified for his second Iranian squad, as a 25-year-old, in the men's 60 kg class. Earlier in the process, he finished third at the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tashkent, Uzbekistan to guarantee his spot on the Iranian wrestling team. Ashkani lost two opening matches each to Cuba's Roberto Monzón (1–4) and Turkey's Şeref Tüfenk (1–3), but stunned the home crowd to tame Greek wrestler Christos Gikas with a 1–6 verdict at the end of the prelim pool. Unlike his previous Games, Ashkani's performance was not enough to advance him to the quarterfinals, placing eleventh in the final standings. In 2005, Ashkani recovered from an Olympic setback to flourish his wrestling career with two more medals. He reaped the men's 60-kg title over South Korea's Kim Keum-Hae at the Summer Universiade in Izmir, Turkey, and then picked up a silver medal from the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, losing out to defending titleholder Armen Nazaryan of Bulgaria due to a three-caution violation by the referee."

The New York Times' Whitney Richardson wrote, \"Her images are carefully structured to blend the familiar with the unknown — antique furniture and vintage fabrics juxtaposed with unnaturally twisted body forms — with the hope of getting viewers to ask one question: 'I know these objects, but why does this all feel so foreign?'\" Her photography is featured in many private and public collections including Elton John's collection and the West Collection. Saatchi Gallery profiled her as an emerging artist of the week in 2007."

(The Grand Standard Bearer of the Crown was the fourth in military commandership after the King, the “Hetman Wielki” (the military Commander in Chief) and the “Hetman Polny” (the Field Commander). Alexander's military career began probably during the Cossack uprising of Bohdan Zynoviy Mykhailovych Khmelnytsky. In 1656 he participated in the war with the Swedes, fighting in the battles of Prostki and Filipów. In the years 1657-1659, together with Polish Hetman Stefan Czarniecki he was dispatched on Western Pomerania and Denmark. Probably commanded the Czarniecki‘s right wing divisions at the battle of Połonka, in June 27, 1660. He was also actively involved in Ukraine. He participated in the Battles of Lyubar and Słobodyszcze. In autumn 1663 under the leadership of Polish King John II Casimir Vasa took part in the expedition to Dniprovsky. Shortly, he defected to the field of Prince Jerzy or George Sebastian Lubomirski opposite to the last King Vasa. Later he returned to the rightful King’s field and commanded troops in battle against Lubomirski’ rebels near Czestochowa. After the end of Lubomirski’s rebellion, Polanowski entered in the service of the Crown Hetman Jan or John Sobieski (future elected King John III Sobieski), who during the free election in 1669 was the major candidate for the Polish Crow and therefore ruler of “The Commonwealth” (the whole Realm - nowadays Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Latvia, etc. ). He participated in the expedition to Hajec, commanding the left side of the Polish army. In the years 1671-1676 he fought against the Turkish and Tartars troops, participating in the expedition to Bratslav, and fighting the Tatars in Chocimska campaign. In August 1683 went to Vienna, but during the military taking exercise in Tarnów Mountains became ill and had to return to his homeland. Soon after, he resigned from the military, living with the profits of the salt mines of Kraków given to him by the King of Poland (Jan III Sobieski) for live."

  "text" : "Antonio Iranzo (4 May 1930 – 7 July 2003) was a Spanish film actor in 77 feature films. He gained popularity for his acting in Island of the Damned and Cut - Throats Nine. Iranzo began his artistic career in the theater, while working as a radio announcer. Later he joined the Nuria Espert Company and made his film debut in 1963 with La chica del auto-stop directed by Miguel Lluch. His physique and hoarse voice helped him get the chance to play the supporting character in various films including Mario Camus's The Legend of Mayor of Zalamea (1973), Gonzalo Suárez's The Regent (1974), Narciso Ibáñez Serrador's Who Can Kill a Child? (1975), Hidden Pleasures (1977), The tobacconist of Vallecas (1986) (the latter two by Eloy de la Iglesia), the TV miniseries Riders of the Dawn (1990) and Vicente Aranda's Libertarias (1996). Iranzo had a well known career on stage, which particularly excelled in his interpretations of classics from the Golden Age. Some of the works featuring him were Adolfo Marsillach and Molière's Tartuffe (1969), Felix Lope de Vega's The Star of Seville (1958), Max Frisch's Andorra (1971), Adolfo Marsillach's Flower of Holiness (1973), Arnold Wesker and Irene Gutiérrez Caba's Chicken Soup with Oats (1978), Martín Recuerda's The Arrecogías the Beguinage of St. Mary of Egypt (1977), José María Rodríguez Méndez's Weddings that were famous in the Rag and Fandanga (1978), Miguel de Cervantes's The Baths of Algiers (1979) and The Roll Lavapies (1979), Woody Allen's Aspirin for Two (1980), Santiago Moncada's Ears of the Wolf (1980), Martin Recuerda's The Deceiting (1981), Miguel Mihura's Peach in Syrup (1982), Ibsen's Mallard (1982), Euripides's Fedra (1984), Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (1988), Alejandro Casona's The Third Word (1992). Iranzo also had a prolific career in television; he played several characters in dramas TVE as Study 1 or Novel, Time Eleven or Fictions. His deep voice helped him in standing out as a voice actor, remembered for being among other characters as BA Baracus in the television series El equipo A. He was the winner of the 1966's Silver Frames Award for Best Actor of Spanish cinema for the film Burnt Skin (La piel quemada). The film was directed by Josep Maria Forn and depicted the social problems of Spain during the decade. In the film Iranzo played the character of an Andalusian worker named Jose who works in Costa Brava and falls in love with a Belgian tourist while his family including wife and two children struggle to reach him. In 2014 the film Who can Kill a Child? was shown at Denver Film Society's Stanley Film Festival."

Aniceta participated - together with other noble women originally from the Piedmont of the end of the 19th century - in the relaunch of the \"Bandera\" embroidery, founding the first laboratory school specialised in embroidery for artistic but also humanitarian purposes. Soon afterwards the laboratory school was named \"Scuola Bandera Piemontese Torino\" and was directed by Countess Sofia Cacherano di Bricherasio. Moreover, she financed a variety of cultural and welfare societies, such as the prestigious \"Accademia di canto corale Stefano Tempia\". Aniceta, wife and then widow of Edoardo Agnelli, married Commander Luigi Lampugnani on 15 January 1883."

Laliotis qualified for the men's heavyweight class (96 kg), when Greece welcomed the world to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. He filled up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling and the Hellenic Olympic Committee, as Greece received an automatic berth for being the host nation. Amassed the home crowd inside Ano Liossia Olympic Hall, Laliotis opened the prelim pool with a shut out victory over China's Wang Yuanyuan by a tough 3–2 verdict, before losing in overtime of his succeeding match 1–4 to Slovakia's Peter Pecha. Placing third in the pool based on technical points and thirteenth overall, Laliotis failed to advance further into the medal rounds."

  "text" : "Amelia Lehmann (née Chambers) (1838 – 1903) was a British and composer and arranger of art songs and popular ballads, many of which she published under the pseudonym \"A. L.\". She was also considered a gifted singer and was the first singing teacher of her daughter Liza Lehmann. Several of her works were performed at the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts between 1897 and 1928, and her song \"When love is kind\" was recorded by Ada Forrest for Pathé Records. Lehmann was the daughter of Anne (née Kirkwood) and Robert Chambers, the Scottish writer and publisher. In 1861, after a lengthy courtship, she married the painter Rudolf Lehmann. Their daughter Liza wrote in her memoirs: My mother certainly had extraordinary gifts, but suffered all her life from quite abnormally developed diffidence. As a girl, she was so musical that her father declared she did not require lessons! It was, therefore, not until after her marriage that she began to study music seriously. I have met most of the artists of my day, and I have never met any one so naturally gifted as my beloved mother. She had a lovely voice, and studied singing with several vocal teachers of renown; but she was never confident about her own achievements, and could hardly ever be induced to sing before any one. The few people who heard her sing have never forgotten her quite peculiar charm. She had a wonderful ear, the gift known as \"absolute pitch,\" and could transpose easily at sight. She wrote some beautiful music, notably an operatic setting of a Goethe libretto; but the same diffidence and exaggerated, almost morbid self-criticism, led her to destroy most of her compositions, including with them many of her best."

During the 1960s, she was an investigative reporter with London's Evening Standard. She was known for scooping other reporters with her account of Winston Churchill's funeral, by vandalising a telephone after filing it, thereby delaying her rivals' reports. She reputedly told Ann Leslie that a female foreign correspondent should: First, sleep with the resident Reuters correspondent and then with the chief of police. That way you'll pick up stories before anyone else. She appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 2 January 1967. Six photographs of her, five in a 1961 series by Ida Kar and one from 1965, by Jorge Lewinski, are in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. A memorial to her, in the form of a planted urn on a stone plinth, stands in St John's Lodge Garden, Regent's Park, London. The plinth is inscribed with the words: In affectionatememory ofAnne Sharpley1928—1989journalistwholoved this garden William Stevenson described how she was nicknamed \"Shapley Sharpley\" by Randolph Churchill."

In the 1986 she moved to the UK and hoped to represent England in the 100m Freestyle at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. She was disqualified, with Zola Budd, on residency grounds. At the time South Africa was subject to an international boycott in protest at the Apartheid government. The ban was upheld by the High Court, and she was unable to compete. She was unable to compete for South Africa after the re-admittance of South Africa to international sport, as she had represented England previously.

  "text" : "Allen Edwardes is the pen-name of a scholar of Middle Eastern and Oriental erotica. He is best known as the author of the 1959 book The Jewel in the Lotus, the introduction to which was written by the noted sexologist and prolific writer, Albert Ellis. The book, named after a famous mantra, is an amassment of sexual curiosities apparently plucked from a variety of ethnographical and orientalist sources. Throughout the book, one finds a plethora of uncontrolled generalizations concerning the sexual behaviour of non-western populations. Doubt has been cast on the sincerity of its scholarship. A recent study accuses the author of \"more than a touch of prurience,\" and warns that \"the guise of orientalist scholarship clearly gives Edwardes leeway to express a surfeit of subconscious homoerotic phantasy.\" As such, the book is a curious and highly specific example of a more general tendency in Western scholarship—or, in this case, rather pseudo-scholarship—which has been criticized as 'Orientalism' (Edward Said). Edwardes, who was born in 1939 and was also known as D. A. Kinsley, wrote a number of other books as well, including racy biographies of Robert Clive and Richard Francis Burton. Kirkus Reviews judged the latter book, published in 1963, to be \"for sensation seekers and pseudo-intellectuals\"."

  "text" : "Aleksey Viktorovich Shevtsov (Russian: Алексей Викторович Шевцов; born January 29, 1979 in Fergana, Uzbek SSR) is a retired amateur Russian Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's lightweight category. He represented Russia in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), and later capped off his wrestling career with a bronze medal in the 60-kg division at the 2005 European Championships in Varna, Bulgaria. Shevtsov also trained as a member of the wrestling team at the Moscow Academy of Combat Sports in Moscow, under his personal coach Yevgeny Peremishin. Shevtsov made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's bantamweight category (54 kg). He lost his opening match 5–10 to North Korea's Kang Yong-gyun, but vowed his own revenge to tame three-time Olympic veteran Marian Sandu of Romania by a rigid 11–8 verdict. Placing second in the prelim pool due to technical point system and twelfth overall, Shevtsov's performance was not enough to put him through to the medal rounds. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Shevtsov qualified for his second Russian squad, as a 25-year-old, in the men's 60 kg class. Earlier in the process, he finished fourth at the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro to guarantee his spot on the Russian wrestling team. Unlike his previous Olympics, Shevtsov dominated the prelim pool with a pair of remarkably strong victories over neighboring China's Ai Linuer (4–2) and Germany's Jurij Kohl (7–0) to secure him a place for the medal rounds. Shevtsov edged past Kazakhstan's Nurlan Koizhaiganov in the quarterfinals with a 3–1 decision, before being overwhelmed by Cuba's Roberto Monzón in the semifinal match 3–6. Shevtsov challenged against reigning Olympic champion Armen Nazaryan of Bulgaria for the bronze medal, but quickly fell behind him by a single-point deficit with a 3–4 decision, dropping the Russian to fourth. In 2005, Shevtsov recovered from an Olympic setback to flourish his wrestling career with a bronze medal over Georgia's David Bedinadze at the European Championships."

  "text" : "Alessandro Momo was an Italian actor, most noted for his role in 1974's Scent of a Woman. He died in a motorcycle accident in Rome on November 19, 1974, a few days before turning 18. He began his career very young, as the protagonist in a series of fotoromanzi, also appearing together with Giusva Fioravanti. He became famous thanks to his performances alongside Laura Antonelli in the film Malizia by Salvatore Samperi about venial sin, and his role in Profumo di donna (Scent of a Woman), by Dino Risi, where he was co-starring with Vittorio Gassman and Agostina Belli. Momo died from a motorcycle accident in the weeks following the end of the making of the film. The motorcycle that had the fatal accident, a Honda CB750, was lent by his friend Eleonora Giorgi, who left for a trip; the actress was later investigated for reckless expectations because Momo was not yet 18 years of age and was not entitled to drive a motorcycle, according to the regulations at the time. Some time later, the singer Patrizio Sandrelli dedicated a song to his memory, which had some success, \"Fratello in amore\" (\"Brother in Love\"). Alessandro is buried in the cemetery of Verano, in Rome, along with his father Gabriele."

He was described as the chief of its external operations. He was the second most senior leader of the Islamic State after its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Media reports in August 2016 suggested he was in charge of a special unit, known as the Emni, that was established by ISIL in 2014 with the double objective of internal policing and executing operations outside the ISIL territory. On 5 May 2015, the U.S. State Department Rewards for Justice Program announced a reward up to US$5 million for information leading to his capture. On 30 August 2016, the Islamic State announced al-Adnani has been killed in Aleppo Province. Both American and Russian Federation government officials claimed responsibility for al-Adnani's death. On 12 September 2016, the U.S. Department of Defense officially confirmed that a U.S. airstrike had killed al-Adnani."

Sotio is considered the central figure of the painting school of Spoleto during the twelfth century. His name (with handwriting Sotio) is located on the crucifix in the Spoleto Cathedral (dated 1187) and he is also attributed some of the frescoes in the Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Spoleto. A fragment from a crucifix attributed to him is a rare example of an early Italian painting executed on parchment affixed to a wooden panel. This suggests that he may have also worked as a manuscript illuminator."

  "text" : "Anthony Opal (born 1983) is an American poet and editor. The author of ACTION, and founding editor of The Economy, his work has appeared in various magazines and journals, including Poetry, Boston Review, Harvard Divinity Bulletin, and Notre Dame Review. An important contributor to the contemporary sonnet form, Opal's poems are process based with a Surrealistic bent toward subversiveness, specifically regarding categories of the holy and the profane. \"Opal's adroit and contemplative poems don’t only fuck with ideas of the holy, they seek them out,\" writes Douglas Kearney. Likewise, in an interview for The Conversant, Luke Fidler describes Opal's work as not only juxtaposing images and formal elements, but \"modes of experience, of remembering, of anticipating.\" Opal holds a BA in English Literature from Elmhurst College and an MFA in Creative Writing (Poetry) from Northwestern University. He lives with his wife and daughter in Chicago."

Taskoudis finished sixth in the 66-kg class when Greece hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, and has also captured three gold medals in the 74-kg division in beach wrestling at the World Championships (2012 to 2014). Throughout his sporting career, Taskoudis has been training for San Georgios Wrestling Club in his native Serres, under his personal coach Avtandil Bzalava. Taskoudis qualified for the Greek squad, as a 19-year-old teen, in the men's welterweight class (66 kg), when his nation hosted the world to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. He filled up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling and the Hellenic Olympic Committee, as Greece received an automatic berth for being the host nation. Amassed the home crowd inside Ano Liossia Olympic Hall, Taskoudis opened the prelim pool with a marvelous victory over India's Ramesh Kumar by a 10–8 verdict, before losing his succeeding match 6–12 to Armenia's Zhirayr Hovhannisyan. Despite a single defeat, Taskoudis secured his spot for the medal rounds due to the most number of technical points he obtained from the pool. He was overpowered by eventual Olympic champion Elbrus Tedeyev of Ukraine in the quarterfinal match 2–6, and then followed it with a 4–6 setback in a playoff against Japan's Kazuhiko Ikematsu for a fifth-place finish, dropping him to sixth."

  "text" : "Allison Argo (born December 23, 1953) is a film producer, director, writer, editor, and narrator. She is best known for her documentaries that focus on endangered wildlife and conservation. Argo's films have received awards including six National Emmys  and the duPont-Columbia Award for journalism. In her early career as an actress, Argo performed on Broadway, in television, and in film. Her theater roles included work as an original cast member in two Broadway theatre productions; and her work in television and film included roles in television movies and a major role in a TV series, along with recurring roles in two soap operas. In 1989, while on location in the state of Washington, Argo happened upon a gorilla caged as an exhibit in a shopping mall. This experience led Argo to produce and direct her first film, The Urban Gorilla (National Geographic 1992), about the lives of captive gorillas. Argo received the duPont-Columbia award for the documentary. Since that time, Argo has dedicated her work towards advocating for the welfare, and understanding of wild animals through documentary films, and also through public speaking engagements. With her production company, ArgoFilms, LTD, Argo has produced eighteen films. Among others, notable award-winning films have included Keepers of the Wild (National Geographic and PBS 1992), The Last Frog (National Geographic 1996), The Secret Life of Cats (National Geographic 1999), The Urban Elephant (National Geographic and PBS NATURE 2000), Chimpanzees: An Unnatural History (PBS NATURE 2006), Crash: a Tale of Two Species (PBS NATURE 2008), and Parrot Confidential (PBS NATURE 2013)."

Chiasson was convicted of insider trading in December 2012, but the conviction was subsequently overturned in a unanimous decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on December 10, 2014. The Supreme Court of the United States denied the Justice Department's request to review the case on October 5, 2015. The appeal's court ruling and the dismissal of the indictment against Chiasson stand."

  "text" : "Antonio de Saliba, also Antonello de Saliba, (c.1466-c.1535) was an Italian painter. Born around 1466, Antonello de Saliba was the son of Giovanni Resaliba, carver of Maltese origins and whose brother was Antonello da Messina. Since he had the same name of his illustrious uncle, he later changed it to Antonio for art dealers during his time in Veneto to avoid confusion on the attribution of the works. He was an apprentice with his brother Peter in the workshop of Messina. His education was marked and influenced thus on the works of this artist. He worked primarily in and around Veneto, in the footsteps of Messina, and perhaps accompanying his cousin Jacobello, attending the school of Giovanni Bellini and Cima da Conegliano where he was further influenced. Since 1497 he is seen via documents and signed works which attest to his working on and off for the next almost forty years. His production rather uneven, especially in the later years. There are some altarpieces executed with his collaboration, for the wooden carpentry, carver of his father, probably a former collaborator of Messina. He died around 1535."

  "text" : "Alexander Brownlie Docharty (1862–1940) was a Scottish painter, mainly in oils. He was the second son of Joseph Docharty and Elizabeth Brownlie. Joseph Docharty was a designer of calico prints; Alexander left school at the age of thirteen to join his father. He studied part-time at the Glasgow School of Art, attending Robert Greenlees' evening classes. In 1878 Docharty’s watercolour On The Cart- Pollockshaws was exhibited at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. The Royal Academy accepted his painting Arran Cottages for exhibition in 1882. In the early 1880s Docharty was a designer for Inglis and Wakefield, a printing firm based at Busby. He left that firm some time before 1885, when he was based at James Docharty's studio in Bath Street, Glasgow. James was Alexander's uncle. Docharty moved to Paris in 1894 to study at the Academie Julien under Benjamin Constant and Jean-Paul Laurens. He subsequently lived at Kilkerran, Ayrshire. His Glen Falloch was exhibited in 1906 at the Glasgow Fine Arts Institute."

(born 1923) is an Iranian Canadian civil engineer and real-estate developer, builder and philanthropist based in Vancouver, British Columbia and Paris, France.He started Arme Construction Company, shortly after he graduated from the University of Charlottenburg in Berlin. Arme became one of the largest construction and development companies in Iran and the Middle East  having built numerous civic and infrastructure projects including roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, whole townships, and an entire Asian Games Sports Complex in Tehran, including a 105,000 seat stadium, indoor Olympic Swimming Pool, Velodrome, Olympic Village and a giant man made lake, all designed by Skidmore Owings and Merrill of Chicago and A. Farmanfarmaian and Associates Architects, and all built with a future Tehran Olympic Games in mind. Arme Construction Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates including Parc des Princes Co, Vanak Park Co, Kamsaz Co, Paziran Co, were also responsible for building some of the Middle East's largest private real estate development projects including the 200,000 sq. metre Parc des Princes and Vanak Park high rise communities and various commercial buildings in Tehran, including the Paziran, Pan American Oil Co and Iranian National Railways office buildings. Abbas Milani, Director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University, in his book 'Eminent Persians' (Syracuse University Press), names Amir Malekyazdi as one of the men and women who made modern Iran. The family, including brothers S. Peter Malek & Shahram Malek and sisters Marjan, Maryam and Elham,has been active in Canada and France since 1981. Through their companies Armeco Construction, Belmont Construction, Millennium Development Group  and others they have continued their legacy of building roads, bridges, sewage treatment plants, civic and municipal projects, and major award winning developments such as the 7 tower and 3 tower City in the Park and OMA projects in Burnaby, L'Hermitage, Lumiere and Alexandra towers in Downtown Vancouver, the Edgewater and Water's Edge projects in West Vancouver, and the Vancouver Olympic Village for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, to mention a few. Having settled his family in Canada, Amir Malekyazdi left for Paris, France again with his wife Mahin, in the late 1980s where at the age of 67 he started a successful real estate development company from scratch, undertaking such high profile projects as the East Side office building in Marne La Vallee (seat of the French Post Office), Regent Park, St. Georges, Villa du Theatre residences and numerous other successful projects."

  "text" : "Allen Bowie Davis (1809–1889) was an American businessman. Davis was born in Montgomery County Maryland to Thomas Davis (1769-1833) and Elizabeth Bowie (1772–1840). His father participated in the Whiskey Rebellion and was the president of the Board of Trustees of the Brookeville Academy, a position that Allen would take later at the age of 24. Davis took over the estate farm Greenwood at 16 and would write educational books on agriculture. By 1850 he would own 27 slaves to maintain four separate farms. In 1840 he would be appointed to the board of public works for Maryland. This in turn led to him becoming the director and trustee of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal during the final 50 miles of construction. In 1846, Davis imported 1,400 tons of Guano for $100,000 to redistribute to farmers without markup. Davis also returned the Tridelphia Cotton Company to profitability. In 1850 he would represent at the state constitutional convention, helping form the Maryland Agricultural College. He served as president of the Washington-Brookville Turnpike Company for 16 years and served as county magistrate. His efforts also brought about one of the countries earliest prohibition laws in the State of Maryland. Davis married Rebecca Comfort Dorsey (1809–1836), daughter of Thomas Beale Dorsey. After her death Davis married again Hester Ann Wilkins (1809–1887). Davis had 5 children: Allen Bowie Davis, Jr. (died 1850), Thomas Davis (1840–1849), William Wilkins Davis (1842–1866), Rebecca Dorsey Davis (1843–1921) and Esther Wilkins Davis (1847–1894). Davis once lived at the Wilson House, part or the Roxbury Mill in Howard County, Maryland, and was proprietor of the family estate Greenwood in Montgomery County built by Ephram Davis in 1755. Davis died in Baltimore at his house on Madison Avenue."

As the first mayor of the newly incorporated city, he presided over the construction of the Hill to Hill Bridge as chairman of the Bethlehem Bridge Commission, significantly enlarged the city's area, extended paved streets, water mains, and municipal sewerage, and provided the city's first municipal park. After leaving office, he returned to Bethlehem Steel and moved his family to nearby Bethlehem Township to a new property, \"Camel's Hump Farm\", formed from over 390 acres of land purchased beginning in 1919 from local farmers. Upon his retirement from Bethlehem Steel in 1927, he began describing himself as a \"gentleman farmer\" and continued in public service until his death at his home in 1948."

  "text" : "Ann Daniels (born 1964 or 1965) is a British polar explorer and motivational speaker. She and her team-mate Caroline Hamilton were the first women to reach both the North Pole and South Pole as part of all-women teams, in 2002. Daniels was born Bradford, England, and grew up there, with four older brothers. Her father was an insurance salesman, her mother a secretary. She worked for NatWest, achieving promotion to assistant bank manager, a post which she gave up in 1994, when her triplets were born. She first reached the North Pole on in the 1997 McVities Penguin Polar Relay, and has been there at least six times in all. Her first attempt to reach the North Pole solo, walking from Russia, was called off in 2005. She appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 21 January 2007, and was awarded an honorary DUniv degree Staffordshire University in the same year. She led Catlin Arctic Survey expeditions in 2009, 2010 and 2011, with Pen Hadow. She is the mother of four children, three of them (two girls and a boy) triplets from her first marriage, plus a daughter from a second partner."

Irwin and his brother Robert Irwin, Jr. were in the mercantile business in Green Bay. In 1827 he married Frances Pamelia Smith, with whom he had seven children. In 1836, he served in the Wisconsin Territorial House of Representatives and then in the Wisconsin Territorial Council. In 1845, he was appointed receiver of the Green Bay Land Office. The position required trips on horseback to Saint Louis, Missouri to deposit funds because there were no banks in Green Bay at the time. His extensive travel duties led to an infection in his arm, which resulted in his death. Irwin died in Green Bay in 1847 while still in office. Elisha Morrow was appointed receiver to fill the vacancy left by Irwin."

A strong advocate of the ‘innovation ready over career ready' paradigm, she is better known for her 'Discover Tomorrow Progressive Principals Workshops'. As an education futurist she studies the emerging global trends and the challenges and opportunities they throw up in the context of K-12 education. She believes that human capacity to dream and to lead enriched and fulfilled lives in the future depends on the choices we make today and that ‘future is not something that happens to us, it is something we create.’ Within this context her quest for a ‘preferred’ future as compared to a ‘possible’ or ‘probable’ future drives her work and commitment to the future of learning. A former member of the UN ICT Task Force, her experiences with ‘tech in ed’ and 'youth development’ give her a unique perspective on defining the future of learning. She advises and consults with country governments, education boards and progressive school leaders; across India, Middle East and Africa. Ashish is the chair of the advisory board of the Economic Times Education Initiative – ‘Future of Learning (2014–2016)’.

Ashtat soon managed to rout an Byzantine army at Basean and then harassed them as far as Satala. He then marched towards Theodosiopolis, and managed to make the city surrender by showing them Theodosius. He then seized several Armenian cities such as Citharizum, Satala, Nicopolis and Apastiay.

A queen is chosen for an entire year. In the history of samba are few madrinhas: Monique Evans, Chris, Alves, Beth Carvalho and Luma Oliveira. Andrade received this title after just one year of parade. In 2012 and 2013, Andrade was madrinha for Imperio de Casa Verde and principal musa for Vila Isabel. The two parades were conducted two days apart in two different sambadromes (Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo). Despite her career of only three years, she attained the highest ranks of samba skills. In an interview for EGO, Andrea announced that after the 2013 parades she would withdraw from Imperio de Casa Verde and from GRES Unidos de Vila Isabel to dedicate more time to raising her son Rinhaldino. She did not rule out a return in the future."

  "text" : "Arthur Stafford Hathaway (1855 — 1934) was an American mathematician. Arthur was born September 15, 1855, in Keeler, Michigan. A student at Cornell University, Hathaway earned a bachelor's degree in 1879. For two years he was instructor in mathematics at Friends High School in Baltimore. Hathaway studied with James Joseph Sylvester at Johns Hopkins University. From Sylvester's lectures he learned some number theory and published notes on congruences. He was an instructor at Cornell University from 1885 to 1890 and an assistant professor in 1891. In October of 1884 William Thomson, Baron Kelvin led a master class on \"Molecular Dynamics and the Wave Theory of Light\" at Johns Hopkins. Kelvin did not provide a text for his course and Hathaway made notes in short-hand. He wrote up the notes and duplicated them with a Papyrograph, a recent stencil-based device. As the demand outstripped the supply, Hathaway corresponded with Kelvin back in Glasgow to prepare for proper publication. After nineteen years the lectures were published. In 1987 Hathaway's original transcription from 1884 was published when Johns Hopkins Center for the History and Philosophy of Science decided to commemorate the centennial of Kelvin's lectures. In Terre Haute, Indiana Hathaway taught at Rose Polytechnic Institute until 1920 and published A Primer on Quaternions in 1896. He became the U.S. national secretary for the international Quaternion Society in 1899."

He came from a family of painters, starting with his grandfather Josef Geist. His father Andreas Geist was a painter of animals and August's first teacher. August then went to the Polytechnikum of Würzburg, before moving to Munich in 1853 to study under Fritz Bamberger for two years. As an independent artist, he travelled the Alps, and published thirteen engravings of castle ruins in Lower Franconia in 1858, with accompanying text by Martin Theodor Contzen. He stayed with landscape painter Johann Wilhelm Schirmer for a while in 1859. He continued to travel and paint over the next several years, but fell ill when travelling to Italy in 1866. He returned to Munich in 1867, and died in 1868. His many oil paintings and detailed studies were sold at auction in 1869. His work can be found in the Mainfränkisches Museum in Würzburg, in the National Gallery in Berlin, and in collections in Bamberg and Munich. The Städtische Galerie Würzburg held a Geist exhibition in 1985, with an accompanying catalogue."

  "text" : "Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary (Arabic:  عبد المجيد عبد الباري‎‎; born 18 July 1990) is a British-Egyptian amateur rapper from West London, also known as Lyricist Jinn and L Jinny, and a suspected Islamist militant. After circulation of video footage related to the decapitation of the American journalist James Foley, British intelligence reportedly centred on three suspects who might be the militant in the footage dubbed \"Jihadi John\", putting a knife to Foley's throat and later on boasting his beheading. One of the main suspects was Abdel Bary, but in February 2015, it was reported that \"Jihadi John\" is Londoner Mohammed Emwazi. It was then speculated that Abdel Bary may be \"John's\" cohort, \"George\". In July 2015, it was reported that Bary was on the run in Turkey, after having deserted ISIL ranks."

Palmer arrived in Tasmania (then called Van Diemen's Land) as a boy in 1838, and joining the Bank of Australasia was promoted to the branch in Adelaide. In 1848, gold having been found in the Sierra Nevada, Palmer headed there and mined with varied success. Gold having been discovered in Australia in 1850 Palmer started to return. The vessel in which he sailed was wrecked on an uninhabited island, where he was compelled to remain for some months, until rescued by a chance passing vessel. In 1854 he started business in Castlemaine, Victoria, and was returned member for Castlemaine Boroughs in the inaugural Victorian Legislative Assembly. Palmer resigned his seat in July 1857; he unsuccessfully stood for Castlemaine Boroughs again in 1858, and Maryborough 1861. In 1860 Palmer re-entered the service of the Bank of Australasia and became manager at Sale, Victoria. Palmer married Susan Georgina Marianne Fereday in George Town, Tasmania in 1861. He was a brother-in-law of Guy Gaunt. Palmer died in St Kilda, Victoria, Australia on 8 December 1901."

However, he became attached to music, as a violinist, and became an excellent landscape painter, training under Faustino Raineri. He was influenced by the works of Cavalier Tempesta, Berghem, and Piazeztta. He traveled to Genoa, where he befriended the painter of seascapes, Orazio Vernet. After two years, he moved to Milan, where he was patronized by the Cardinal Giuseppe Pozzobonelli; who was a collector of the landscape artists Dietrich. Upon returning to Brescia, his health was poor, and he had no reputation in that town. Among his pupils was the Count Aimo Maggi."

In addition to his journalistic career, on August 27, 2012, Al-Sayyad was chosen as a senior advisor to the first elected Egyptian president after the January 25 uprising, Mohammed Morsi. He had earlier declined a ministerial post as Minister of Information, to keep his editorial independence. Al-Sayyad resigned from the Presidential Advisory Board in protest over the constitutional draft of November 2012, which he considered a key failure of the Muslim Brotherhood to govern inclusively. He first announced his resignation through his Twitter account, and later wrote an open letter to then-president Morsi, which has created wide controversy after it ran in Al-Shorouk newspaper. Following the 2011 uprisings in the Arab Middle East, Al-Sayyad devoted much of his writing and time to the issue of transitional justice and has been since considered an expert on the topic. He has provided consultancy in the field of transitional justice to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and, in 2013, he was appointed by the Egyptian ministry of Justice as a member of the four-member-committee to work on transitional justice in Egypt."

Dimitratos flipped from the left wing to the right wing during the dictatorial regime of Ioannis Metaxas, serving as Minister of Labor from 1936 to 1941. During the Axis occupation of Greece, Dimitratos fled the country, remaining as Minister of Labor in the Greek government in exile until dismissed in February 1942 in a move to liberalize that body. After spending the rest of World War II in the United States, where he cooperated with American military intelligence, Dimitratos returned to Greece in September 1945. He was elected as a parliamentary deputy in 1946 and again from 1956 to 1961 under the banner of the right wing National Radical Union (ERE), serving again as Minister of Labor from 1958 to 1961."

  "text" : "Auguste van Biene (16 May 1849 – 23 January 1913) was a Dutch composer, cellist and actor. He became best known for his composition The Broken Melody, performed by the composer as part of a musical play of the same name. Van Biene grew up in Rotterdam and displayed a musical interest as a youth. After some private studies with Adrien Francois Servais at the Brussels Conservatory he moved to London to seek work as a performer. Van Biene was discovered by Sir Michael Costa, who hired him to play the cello in his Covent Garden orchestra in November 1867, eventually promoting him to principal cellist. In 1878 van Biene was a touring musical director for Richard D'Oyly Carte's Comedy Opera Company, and in the 1880s he conducted successful light operas and Victorian burlesques. By the 1880s he had also become a theatrical manager as well as an actor and playwright. As a cellist he was invited to be an examiner at the Royal Academy of Music in 1884. In 1892 he commissioned, wrote the score for, and starred in a musical play, the highly successful The Broken Melody, in which he toured for many years. He died on 23 January 1913 while on stage at the Brighton Hippodrome."

  "text" : "Andre the Seal (May 16, 1961 - July 1986) was a male harbor seal pup found off the island of Robinson's Rock in Penobscot Bay, United States. The seal was adopted by Harry Goodridge, who was then a tree surgeon and the Harbormaster of Rockport, Maine. Harry raised the pup, hoping the seal would become his scuba diving companion, and expecting that the seal would eventually return to the wild when given the opportunity. Instead, Andre chose to stay with Harry in Rockport until his death in 1986. The multi-faceted story that developed over the course of their 25-year bond has been well-documented in hundreds of news articles, several books, a 1994 feature film released by Paramount Pictures, and a PBS documentary. Andre's fame and popularity even resulted in a memorial being built in his honour in Rockport, Maine harbour."

  "text" : "Donald Angus Cameron (1908-2002), publicly known by his middle name, was an American book editor and publisher. Cameron scored his first success handling The Joy of Cooking by Irma Rombauer for Indianapolis publisher Bobbs-Merrill Company in 1936. He moved to Little, Brown and Company in 1938. While editor at Little, Brown, Cameron was responsible for the promotion of then-unknown writer J. D. Salinger, controversial poet Ogden Nash, and various left wing authors including Lillian Hellman and Howard Fast. In 1947 the politically radical Cameron became a public target of red-baiting led by historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. over Little, Brown's refusal to publish Animal Farm by George Orwell. He was ultimately forced out at Little, Brown in 1951 over controversy surrounding the proposed publication of Communist author Howard Fast's novel Spartacus. Following his departure from Little, Brown, Cameron found himself blacklisted from the mainstream publishing industry due to the pervasive climate of McCarthyism. In 1953 Cameron formed his own left wing publishing house, Cameron Associates, later joining forces with radical publisher Albert E. Kahn to launch the publishing house Cameron and Kahn. The blacklisting of Cameron ended only in 1959 when New York publisher Alfred A. Knopf hired him as a senior editor."

A second work is the Messale di Santa Tecla (1402). Among other influential illuminators of his age, whose works may have been seen by Anovelo are those of Giovannino de' Grassi and Giovanni di Benedetto da Como. Frescoes in the Oratorio di Santo Stefano, Lentate sul Seveso are attributed to Anovelo."

  "text" : "Arlene Pieper became the first woman to officially finish a marathon in the United States when she finished the Pikes Peak Marathon in Manitou Springs, Colorado, in 1959. Her daughter Kathie, 9, became the youngest competitor at that time to finish the race to the summit, but did not finish the whole marathon. Arlene also entered the Pikes Peak Marathon in 1958 but stopped at the summit, therefore being disqualified. In 1959 women had the choice of a race to the summit or the full marathon up to the summit and down. That year Katherine Heard was first to the summit with a time of 5:17:52 but did not run down the mountain. Arlene reached the summit four minutes later, and finished the marathon with a time of 9:16. She did the marathon to promote a gym she and her husband owned in Colorado Springs, called Arlene's Health Studio. She trained for a year, wearing tennis shoes she bought from a dime store. She had three children at the time. After spending four years in Colorado, she and her husband returned to California, where she had lived as a teenager and where they had run some gyms for exercise guru Harold Zinkin. They were also acquainted with exercise guru Jack LaLanne and Arnold Schwarzenegger. After they returned to California they ran another gym for Zinkin. Pieper was unaware of the groundbreaking nature of her marathon until she was contacted by a historian in 2009. She served as the official starter for the Pikes Peak Marathon that year, and hung the Pikes Peak Marathon medal around the neck of the 2009 women's winner, who credited her win to Arlene's inspiration. As of 2014, Arlene attends the Pikes Peak Marathon every year as part of the ceremonies."

  "text" : "Adolphus Meetkerke (22 December 1819 – 11 February 1879) was an English landowner and cricketer who played in one cricket match for Cambridge University that is recognised as having been first-class. He was born at Rushden, Hertfordshire and died at Southsea, Hampshire. Meetkerke was descended from the Flemish Adolf van Meetkercke who settled in England in the late 16th century; the Meetkerke family took possession of the historic Julians manor house and lands at Rushden in north Hertfordshire in the 18th century, and he was the sixth of the line to bear his name. The family was connected to that of the novelist Anthony Trollope; the novelist's great-grandfather at one stage stood to inherit Julians, and a Meetkerke-owned farmhouse at Harrow, Middlesex was leased to the novelist's father. Adolphus Meetkerke was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. His single game of first-class cricket was the 1840 University Match against Oxford University; in a low-scoring game, he batted as a lower-order batsman and made scores of 8 and 0. Meetkerke inherited the Julians estate in 1840 and married in 1841; it is not clear if he took a degree at Cambridge University. He served in the Hertfordshire Militia and was also a Justice of the Peace for the county; as landowner at Rushden, he endowed the local school."

  "text" : "Ammiel J. Willard was a chief justice on the South Carolina Supreme Court. He was born in Albany, New York in 1822. He studied law under Willis Hall, the attorney-general of New York, before being made assistant counsel of New York City in 1848. Willard came to South Carolina during the Civil War as a lieutenant colonel for black troops in the Union army. On November 1864, his regiment took part in the Battle of Honey Hill.  In 1866, he was serving on a military commission in Charleston, South Carolina and was involved in the prosecution of three residents of Anderson, South Carolina for the murder of a Northern soldier; the case brought attention to Willard even though the defendants were later released. When the South Carolina Supreme Court was reconstituted in 1868 under the Reconstruction government, Willard was made an associate justice along with Solomon L. Hoge and Chief Justice F.J. Moses. Because Chief Justice Moses suffered poor health, much of the operation of the court fell on Willard. On May 15, 1877, Willard was elected chief justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court by the South Carolina General Assembly, beating Samuel McGowan by a vote of 86-39. In an early opinion of tremendous political consequence, after the election of 1876, Willard cast the deciding vote in favor of Wade Hampton III as South Carolina's first governor after Reconstruction. As a result of his support of Hampton, Willard fell out of favor with the South Carolina Republicans, and Willard's position on the court was challenged. Willard himself claimed that, when he was elected in May 1877, the General Assembly had had no choice but to elect him to a full six-year term as set in the state constitution. His opposition, however, argued that he had been elected to fill only the unexpired portion of Chief Justice Moses's own six-year term. At what would have been the expiration of Chief Justice Moses's own six-year term, the Republican opposition convinced Governor Simpson to resign on September 1, 1880, and elected him to assume the position of chief justice. The dispute was heard by the South Carolina Supreme Court's other two justices and one trial judge sitting by designation who decided on October 15, 1880, that Chief Justice Willard's term had been only for the unexpired balance of his predecessor's tenure; thus, former Governor Simpson assumed the office of chief justice. Having lost the chief justiceship, Willard moved to Washington, D.C. in 1884. He died at his home at 1446 Corcoran Street NW, Washington, D.C. on May 5, 1900, and is buried at Arlington Cemetery."

In 1921, he graduated from St. Paul's School, and from Harvard University in 1924. After graduation, Hamilton worked for a newspaper publisher, a Wall Street banking firm, and even tried his had at producing motion pictures. In 1930, Hamilton ran an unsuccessful campaign for a state senate seat in New York as a Republican. Hamilton went on to serve as the Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Public Markets in Hew York City, until a disagreement with Mayor LaGuardia forced his resignation. He later went on to serve as an Assistant to the Commissioner of Sanitation. During World War II, he served as a Major in the United States Marine Corps. He served for over 15 years as the President of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society, one of the oldest historic preservation groups in the United States. Under his leadership, the group assisted in preserving Hamilton Grange, the historic summer house of his great-great-grandfather, and oversaw its transfer to the National Park Service. Hamilton died of emphysema while on vacation in London."

  "text" : "Armin Dale Kaiser (born November 10, 1927, in Piqua, Ohio) is an American biochemist, molecular geneticist, molecular biologist and developmental biologist. Kaiser received in 1950 his bachelor's degree from Purdue University and in 1955 his PhD from Caltech in biology. At Caltech he was in Max Delbrück's bacteriophage group and received his PhD in biology under Jean Weigle with thesis A genetic analysis of bacteriophage lambda. Kaiser was in 1956 a postdoc at the Pasteur Institute in Paris (where he worked in Francois Jacob's group) and afterward became an instructor and then in 1958 an assistant professor in microbiology at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1959 he became an assistant professor at Stanford University, where in 1966 he became a professor for biochemistry at Stanford Medical School. Since 1989 he has been there a professor for developmental biology. Kaiser in the beginning of his career concentrated on the molecular genetics of bacteriophage lambda. He was especially concerned with the control mechanisms for lysogeny. He found one of the first examples of self-regulation of a gene (cI, the repressor gene of lambda phage) and later did pioneering work on molecular chaperones. Some of the methods developed by Kaiser's laboratory became important in genetic engineering. In the 1970s he worked on the developmental biology of swarms of myxobacteria. In the 2000s his laboratory team did research on genetic and biochemical methods to control the swarm and propagation behavior of the bacterial species Myxococcus xanthus. When starved, the Myxococcus bacteria aggregate together to make fruiting bodies, each with approximately spores; the form of the fruiting body is species-specific. Kaiser's laboratory succeeded in the identification and molecular elucidation of the roles of a series of molecular messengers in the swarm and propagation behavior of Myxococcus. Kaiser received in 1970 the U. S. Steel Foundation Award in Molecular Biology, in 1980 the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, in 1981 the Waterford Biomedical Science Award, in 1997 the Abbott Lifetime Achievement Award of the American Society for Microbiology and in 1991 the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal. In 1970 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1993 Kaiser was the president of the Genetics Society of America."

  "text" : "Aage Thaarup (1906–1987) was a Danish-born milliner who ran a celebrated hatmaking business in London between the 1930s and 1970s. Among his notable clients were the Queen Mother and Queen – for whom he designed the bearskin tricorn worn at the annual Trooping the Colour parade. When this famous hat was displayed at an exhibition in 2003, Suzy Menkes said in The New York Times: \"There is a particular combination of madness and dignity to the dashing tricorn that Aage Thaarup created\". There was certainly an eccentric element to many of Thaarup's hats – he once created a design modelled on the Royal Albert Hall for a British Pathé news feature – but this was underpinned by hat design skills garnered from a long apprenticeship in Copenhagen, Delhi, Paris and Berlin. During a more than 40-year career, he was beset by financial difficulties on more than one occasion and still retained a loyal customer base – not least The Queen. His Times obituary noted: \"He was not hardened by fame or fortune. He wore a cheerful disposition and a bow-tie always at a ten-to-four angle\"."

  "text" : "Alan Henning (15 August 1967 – c. 3 October 2014) was an English taxicab driver-turned-volunteer humanitarian aid worker. He was the fourth Western hostage killed by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) whose killing was publicised in a beheading video. Henning was captured during ISIL's occupation of the Syrian city of Al-Dana in December 2013. He was there helping provide humanitarian relief. The British Foreign Office withheld news of Henning's capture while it attempted to negotiate his release. Local colleagues warned Henning not to cross the border into Syria, but he said he wanted to make sure the supplies were delivered safely. When he was captured, Henning was a driver for the organisation Rochdale Aid 4 Syria. Rochdale Aid 4 Syria campaigned for the release of Al Qaeda terrorist Aafia Siddiqui, currently serving an 86-year prison sentence. The group even named projects in her honour. Rochdale Aid 4 Syria was condemned fiercely by the local MP Simon Danczuk. Rochdale Aid 4 Syria also raised money on behalf of Al-Fatiha Global, a British-based organisation which claimed to provide humanitarian aid to those caught up in warzones. Al-Fatiha Global is a registered charity which was under investigation by the Charity Commission after one of its workers was photographed with his arms around two hooded fighters carrying machine guns. Al-Fatiha Global said that worker had been dismissed. Al Qaeda member Adam Gadahn condemned the beheading. Henning was shown at the end of David Cawthorne Haines's execution video, released on 13 September 2014, and was referred to as being the next victim by Mohammed Emwazi, the media described as \"Jihadi John\" of the ISIL cell described as The Beatles. A video of Henning's beheading was released on 3 October 2014. After his murder, British Prime Minister David Cameron ordered MI5, MI6, and GCHQ to track and kill or capture the killer. Emwazi was killed in a drone strike in 2015."

  "text" : "Aron Anazia is an American actor, producer, rapper and songwriter. From the town of Landover Hills, Aron has always had an interest for the arts and sciences. While Aron was in elementary school he would participate in theater & modeling performances. In high school Aron slowed down from performing on stage and instead focused more on the sciences, as he was placed in advanced chemistry courses. Gwynn Park High School is where Aron & BJay Da Fool met. Aron had a lot of fun in Brandywine but wanted to be surrounded by the arts again. So Aron applied to North Carolina Agricultural And Technical State University as a chemistry major. By Aron's third year in college, he was featured in 4 out 4 of the universities major theater productions. Wanting to spread his scope of the entertainment industry, Aron also studied abroad, interned at the university radio station WNAA 90.1, and interned as a liaison between his university and Capital records. After his study at North Carolina Agricultural And Technical State University, Aron decided to go to London and study dramatic arts after receiving advice from the late-great Frankie Day (President of Alpha Psi Omega). In order to attend LAMDA's classical and some what conservatory program Aron had to audition in New York City. Once Aron arrived at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts he began to experiment with the sciences again. Brewing his own beer, which oftentimes ended up becoming more of a wine than a beer led to his experimentation in other fields such as beat-making (again). While Aron enjoyed studying the likes of Shakespeare and so many others, he yearned to be outside of the classroom. So he packed up his belongings and decided to shoot an independent (experimental) film entitled \"You Changed The World.\" After filming in Tanzania, Aron decided to do something considered a little off-center by the individuals around him at the time. He decided to move back home in order to become a better producer. While back at home, Aron connected with a lot of hommies. While making beats in the \"basement\" Aron discovered a sound and a style that he decided to safeguard within his art. With the support of his friends and family Aron focused in on beatmaking for about 3 years and released an album entitled \"Training Music.\" As if that wasn't enough, Aron then decided to retire from making music in order to take his talents to the City of Angels (Los Angeles, CA.) Aron is currently developing a number of projects. May 2016 Aron announced he is producing a sitcom entitled \"Up Like Aye\" about a rapper who becomes the worlds biggest one hit wonder. As for June 2016, Aron is also in the process of tent-poling a franchise with the working title \"Vengeance - the Rising Sun.\""

  "text" : "Ameinias the Phocian (flourished 277/272 BC) was an ancient Greek pirate and mercenary leader in the service of king Antigonus II Gonatas of Macedon. Ameinias was from the region of Phocis in Central Greece. In his earlier career he had been a pirate captain, gaining a certain reputation, but in the year 277 or 276 BC Antigonus Gonatas employed him to overcome the cruel tyrant of Cassandreia, Apollodorus, who had resisted a Macedonian siege for ten months. Ameinias accordingly proceeded to gain the trust of the tyrant, pretending to reconcile him to Antigonus and settle the dispute between them. He also supplied him with provisions and wine and thus convinced him to lower his guard. Meanwhile he secretly prepared an army of two thousand men and a task force of ten Aetolian pirates under the command of Melatas (or Melotas). Observing that the walls of Cassandreia were thinly guarded, the pirates climbed to the parapet between the towers and fixed the ladders for the two thousand men, who immediately advanced and conquered the place. Ameinias then invited Antigonus to take possession of the conquered city. In the year 272 BC Ameinias was still in the service of the Macedonian king, being attested as the garrison commander of Corinth, who led a mercenary force into the Peloponnese to aid the Spartans against king Pyrrhus of Epirus. A year later Ameinias was probably substituted by a new governor, the historian Craterus, and his name is not mentioned any further."

At 16 years of age, Pogodin started appearing on theater stage in small roles. In 1922 he moved to Moscow, where he started working in small variety theaters performing funny songs. In 1924 he was already appearing on the stage of the prestigious Hermitage Theater. In 1938 Pogodin was invited to sing the lead role of Albert in an operetta titled Delicate Diplomacy (\"Тонкая дипломатия\" by Johann Strauss) at the Moscow Theater of Miniatures; he performed at the theater in the 1938–1939 season. Then he accidentally met theater director A. Arnold who invited him to sing the lead role in the operetta Chocolate Soldier (based on a work by Bernard Shaw, with music by the Pokrass brothers) that was set to open the 1939 summer season in the CDKA park. The operetta, which played in the park for a month, featured many famous artists including the Alexander Tsfasman Jazz Orchestra, Maria Mironova, etc. After that Tsfasman invited Pogodin to perform with his orchestra in the Khudozestvenny movie theater and on Saturdays and Sundays after midnight on the radio. Pogodin also recorded a number of grammophone records. And here composer and friend Konstantin Listov offered Pogodin to become the first artist to sing a new song he wrote. The song, titled \"V Parke Chair\" (\"В парке Чаир\"), instantly made \"widely known in narrow circles\" Pogodin a popular and trendy singer. In December 1939, he decided to take part in the first All-Russian Variety Artists Contest and became a Laureat along with such singers as Klavdiya Shulzhenko, Keto Dzhaparidze, etc. Since then he toured a lot and continued to sing on the radio. His grammophone records were very popular. Among his songs that were played everywhere were: \"V Parke Chair\", \"Vozvrata Net\" (\"Возврата нет\"), \"Ya Zhdu Pisma\" (\"Я жду письма\"), \"Oglyanis\" (\"Оглянись\"). Football matches at the time would usually open with his song \"Schastlivy Dozhdik\" (\"Счастливый дождик\")."

He was a prominent dogmatician of the so-called \"Young Hegelian\" school of thought, and an important advocate of \"free Christianity\" in Switzerland. He studied theology at the University of Basel as a pupil of Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette and Wilhelm Wackernagel, and where, with his good friend, Jacob Burckhardt, he tried his hand at poetry. In 1839 he relocated to the University of Berlin, where he was student of Wilhelm Vatke. At Berlin, he engaged himself in studies of works by Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. In addition to Schleiermacher and Hegel, another important influence was a contemporary, the German theologian David Friedrich Strauss. From 1843 to 1850 he served as pastor in the town of Münchenstein, and during this time period (1845–50), with David Fries (1818–1875), he was editor of Kirche der Gegenwart, a publication of speculative-critical theology. In 1850, despite opposition from conservatives, he was named an associate professor of theology at the University of Zürich. In 1860 he attained a full professorship of dogmatics at Zürich. He was a member of the Schweizerischer Zofingerverein (Swiss Zofinger Society) and a participant in Alfred Escher's Mittwochsgesellschaft. From 1871 onward, he was active in cantonal politics, being a member of the liberal-conservative party."

In June 2014, American film director Oliver Stone acquired rights to a screen adaptation of Kucherena's novel, Time of the Octopus, the story of fictional American whistleblower Joshua Cold. Threatened by his government and waiting for a decision on his request for Russian asylum, Cold spends three weeks in the transit area of the Moscow airport. Stone said, \"Anatoly has written a 'grand inquisitor'-style Russian novel weighing the soul of his fictional whistleblower against the gravity of a 1984 tyranny that has achieved global proportions.\" The book, first in a \"psychological-political thriller trilogy,\" is set to be released on March 3, 2015, according to state news agency RIA Novosti. The Moscow Times reported that Kucherena said Snowden had already received a copy of the book and liked it. In April 2015, WikiLeaks revealed that Oliver Stone paid $1 million for the movie rights to Kucherena's novel."

  "text" : "Alton E. (Chuck) Cianchette (1930 – January 18, 2000) was an American businessperson and politician from Maine. A Democrat from central Maine, Cianchette resided in both Pittsfield, Maine and Newport, Maine during his 4 terms in the Maine Senate. Cianchette was first elected in 1972 while residing in Pittsfield. Re-elected two years later, Cianchette did not seek public office again until 1992, when he had moved to Newport. He ran in 1992 as part of a bipartisan campaign he spearheaded to get more business managers elected to the Maine Legislature. After raising an unprecedented $130,000 for his 1992 campaign, Cianchette was elected once again. Cianchette and fellow Democratic State Senator Donald Esty, Jr. both were seeking the Senate Presidency if the Democrats maintained control of that body. Cianchette was reelected but the Maine Republican Party took control of the body following the 1994 general election and Jeffrey Butland was elected Senate President instead. Cianchette co-founded Cianbro Corporation in Pittsfield, Maine in 1949. Cianbro eventually became the largest construction company in the state. He also served as a trustee and philanthropist for Maine Central Institute in Pittsfield. Working through the MCI board, Cianchette often donated his own money to renovate the campus. Cianchette was born in Pittsfield as the youngest of seven children. He graduated from Maine Central Institute. He died on January 18, 2000 when his single engine 1948 Cessna crashed in rural eastern Kentucky on route from Maine to his winter home in St. Petersburg, Florida."

After teaching mathematics at Cheltenham College and the Oxford Military College, he took a post at Faraday House, in Southampton Row, London, which had been newly founded to train electrical engineers. In 1909 he became the Principal, a position he held until 1939. There he pioneered the sandwich course, whereby students had a year or so in the classroom and then experienced work in industry before returning to the classroom. He also wrote a number of articles for the journal Electrician which he later published in book form. He acted as President or vice-President of a number of societies, including the presidency of the Physical Society in 1922–24 and of the Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1923. In 1924 he was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, his citation acknowledging that he was \"Distinguished for his knowledge of alternating current phenomena, inductances and electrostatics.\" In 1940 he was awarded the Faraday Medal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. He died in 1943 after a long illness. He had married Edith, the daughter of H.B.Ince, MP, and had a son and a daughter."

Ahmed Alhatti is the man behind the $272mn “twisting tower” called Cayan Tower, in Dubai Marina. The 75-storey skyscraper was delivered after seven years last June following a series of delays. It has since gone on to win plaudits and awards for its original design, which reduces wind forces on the tower. Alhatti told Construction Week in February 2014 that he was assessing land options for more projects in Dubai. “I am taking my time in the UAE, because everyone is waiting to see what we will do after Cayan Tower. We want to do something unique; we can’t just do a normal building anymore.”"
