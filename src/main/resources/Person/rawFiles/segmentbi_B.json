  "text" : "Blaudzun is the stage name of the Dutch singer-songwriter Johannes Sigmond (Arnhem, Netherlands, 26 October 1974) who played for years in various bands and projects before pursuing a solo career in 2006. Named Blaudzun, called after a relatively unknown Danish cyclist from the 70s, he works in 2007 on a special collection of songs, originally intended to be a soundtrack for a midnight car drive. The first six songs came together as the self-released EP \"Loveliesbleeding\". He heads south to Barcelona to complete his self-titled debut that is released April 2008 on V2 Records Benelux. Blaudzun toured the Benelux countries in 2008 including Metropolis Festival and supported Norwegian singer Ane Brun and Mark Eitzel's American Music Club. In September 2009 he finished recording Seadrift Soundmachine (V2 Benelux) during sessions with The City of Prague Orchestra, known for its filmscores (Das Leben Der Anderen, and David Lynch' Lost Highway). Blaudzun again wrote most of the songs in his beloved Barcelona and recorded in different studios in the Netherlands and Prague. His second LP Seadrift Soundmachine was released on 12 February 2010. Blaudzun made big impressions that year at the big summer festivals in Holland, including into The Great Wide Open and Lowlands. He ended the year with a sold out club tour. Blaudzun broke through in the Benelux and beyond with his third album Heavy Flowers (2012) which was released in The Netherlands, Belgium, Scandinavia and the US (Krian Music Group). This was followed by sold out club tours in both the Netherlands and Belgium, festivals in both Europe and the USA including Eurosonic/Noorderslag 2012, Dranouter, The Great Escape, Sziget, SXSW and Lowlands and winning awards such as the Dutch Public Broadcasting Award for Best Album of the Year 2012, an Edison for Best Male Artist at the Dutch Edison Awards and an award for Best Alternative Act at 3FM (Dutch national radio). The single \"Flame on My Head\" became an instant classic on Studio Brussel and hit both their Hotlist and the Afrekening Charts. Blaudzuns latest album Promises of No Man's Land was released by V2 Benelux (Benelux & World) and Glitterhouse Records (Germany, Swiss, Austria) on 7 March 2014. The album entered the Dutch Album top 100 at No. 1 and entered the charts at No. 6 in Belgium.Promises of No Man's Land is also the title of the first single from the album and is the closing anthem of the daily Olympic program 'NOS Studio Sportwinter' in Sotsji. The video was made by Kimmo Films and directed by Mirka Duijn & Nina Spiering. In April 2014 Blaudzun once again received an award for Best Alternative Act at 3FM. During the summer of 2014 he toured Europe with his band playing on festivals like Lowlands, Pukkelpop in Belgium, Hurricane & Southside in Germany and Bråvalla in Sweden. In the spring of 2015 his new single Powder Blue, the official title song for Dutch movie Ventoux, was released. Previously Blaudzun also composed the official anthem Bon Voyage! for this year's edition of the Tour the France that will start in his hometown Utrecht this summer."

  "text" : "Berta Geissmar (14 September 1892 Mannheim – 3 November 1949 London) was the secretary and business manager for two prominent orchestral conductors, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Sir Thomas Beecham. From 1922 until 1934, Geissmar worked for the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Furtwängler, including planning and organising foreign tours for the orchestra. Because of her Jewish heritage, she was forced to leave the post and her native Germany in late 1934. Fleeing to London, she gained a similar position with Thomas Beecham and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. She continued in this position until shortly before her death. Geissmar's autobiography, The Baton and the Jackboot (1944) gives an account of the personalities of these two musicians, and provides a personal insight into the lives and persecution from 1933 of German people who, like her, were Jews or who opposed Nazi ideas."

Wey and NYGG were among the most active \"facilitators and promoters\" of reverse takeovers that allowed small Chinese companies to raise capital on U.S. markets, until reverse takeovers became the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation in 2011. In September 2015, he was indicted by the United States Department of Justice on charges of securities fraud, stock manipulation, money laundering, and wire fraud for his role in an alleged fraudulent scheme to profit from undisclosed, controlling ownership interests in several companies in the United States, including 6D Global Technologies Inc.\"  He is also facing a defamation suit stemming from his attacks on a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regulator and Georgetown University law professor in his internet magazine The Blot. According Bloomberg Businessweek, he has also used the publication to defame investigative journalists."

  "text" : "Born in Dunedin, Drake sang in the choir of the local St Paul's cathedral, and was educated at Otago Boys' High School. He then studied at the University of Otago, where he sang with the music society. He made his opera debut in 1948 as Escamillo in Bizet's Carmen, performed as part of the Otago Centennial in a production which then toured around the country. Receiving a government bursary in 1949, Drake travelled to London. The following year he received a two-year contract as a full-time principal in the Covent Garden Opera Company. During that time he created the roles of Donald, in the 1951 world premiere of Britten's Billy Budd, and Watchful in Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress. To cover a difficult scene change, Vaughan Williams inserted an aria specially for Drake, of which The Times critic commented: \"For pure singing, there was nothing finer than the interlude between the first and second acts, in which Mr Bryan Drake sang the 121st psalm with perfect declamation and limpid purity of tone and style.\" At the Welsh National Opera during the 1950s and '60s, Drake's roles included Germont in Traviata, Ferrando in Trovatore, Flint, the sailing-master, in Billy Budd, and the title roles in Nabucco and Macbeth. At Sadler's Wells, he sang Creon in Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex and Mephistopheles in Gounod's Faust. In 1960, Britten invited Drake to sing the role of Junius in The Rape of Lucretia, at the Aldeburgh festival. Britten, known to be exacting and for dropping musicians who ceased to please him, never lost his high opinion of Drake. For the next 15 years, Drake was a regular member of Britten's English Opera Group, not only singing and recording various roles in his operas, but also performing various leading roles in operas by Malcolm Williamson, Gordon Crosse and Thea Musgrave. He also appeared in BBC television productions of Peter Grimes (as Balstrode) and Billy Budd (as Flint, a role he also recorded for Decca under the composer's baton). In the Church Parables Britten composed between 1964 and 1968, the composer wrote roles specially for Drake in all three: the Traveller in Curlew River, the Astrologer in The Burning Fiery Furnace and the Elder Son in The Prodigal Son. In 1972, Drake began to teach singing, first at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He was director of opera at the Royal College of Music from 1981 until 1985, after which he and his wife settled in Aldringham, Suffolk.  From 1987 he worked as voice consultant at the Britten-Pears School in Aldeburgh. His final performance was in 1999, when he played the Voice of God in a production of Britten's Noye's Fludde in Aldeburgh parish church."

She started her career as a schoolgirl as a group dancer in films to help support her family after her father's death. She picked up more films after she finished her schooling. Most of her roles were as glamorous dancers. Her first role was in Sautela Bhai (1962) opposite Guru Dutt at age 17. She honed her acting skills performing in Bengali plays. Her career consisted of more than 150 films. Her peak period was between 1961 and 1966. In Hawa Mahal (1962), she played the role of Helen's sister. Some of her roles were in Bimal Roy's Bandini (1963), F.C. Mehra's Professor and Amrapali, Atmaram's Shikar, Umang, Yeh Gulistan Hamara, Dil Aur Mohabbat, Zindagi Aur Maut and Wahan Ke Log. Later, she became a character actress and enjoyed her biggest success playing the villainous sister-in-law in the 1975 blockbuster Jai Santoshi Maa. Her real-life husband Ashish Kumar was the leading man in the hit film. She married him in 1967 and gradually eased out of films after giving birth to a daughter and a son. Of all her films, her favorite roles were as Jeetendra's foster sister in Jeene Ki Raah (1969), followed by another film More Man Mitwa."

  "text" : "Bernhard Walke (born 28 July 1940) is a pioneer of mobile Internet access and professor emeritus at RWTH Aachen University in Germany. He is an outstanding driver of wireless and mobile 2G to 5G cellular radio networks technologies. In 1985 he proposed a local cellular radio network comprising technologies present in 2G to 4G or discussed for 5G systems like self-organization of a radio mesh network, integration of circuit- and packet switching, de-centralized radio resource control, TDMA/spread spectrum information transmission, antenna beam-steering, spatial beam multiplexing, interference coordination, S-Aloha based multiple access and demand assigned traffic channels, mobile broadband transmission using mm-waves, and multi-hop communication. In 1991 he proposed CELLPAC for packet switching in GSM which triggered development of standard GPRS. In 1999 he proposed fixed two-hop decode-and-forward relays for cellular radio, now mandatory in standards 3GPP LTE Rel.10 and IEEE 802.16.1 (mobile broadband WiMAX). The relay concept triggered evolution of cellular radio architecture towards 3GPP LTE Small Cell networks, e.g. femto and pico cells operating like relays on radio resources provided by a donor base station. The Communications Networks (ComNets) research team in large parts designed the ETSI/BRAN HiperLAN2 medium access control protocol adopted by standard IEEE 802.16 (WiMax) and used as a baseline in 3GPP LTE. Radio spectrum requirements for packet-switching mobile radio systems were calculated by World Radio Conference 2007 using a queuing model developed by Bernhard and his team. Work by Bernhard and his team on wireless quality of service supporting multi-hop radio networks materialized in standard IEEE 802.11s. Walke earned his Dipl. Ing. (M.Sc.) degree in Electrical Engineering and Data Processing (1965) from University of Stuttgart, Germany. He worked two years as a Trainee with Telefunken and joined Telefunken Research (1967) where he received his doctorate (1975) from University of Stuttgart. As a department head at AEG Telefunken (now Airbus AG) he switched to FernUniversität Hagen, Germany (1983) as a professor for Data Processing Techniques. During 1990-2007 he was professor and director of the School of Communications Networks (ComNets) at RWTH Aachen' Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology and thereafter (until 2012) head of the ComNets Research Group."

They set up Apollo Records in 1944, and she became the driving force behind its development, particularly in recruiting star performers including Mahalia Jackson, Champion Jack Dupree, The \"5\" Royales, Wynonie Harris, The Larks, and Solomon Burke. She took sole control of the business in 1948, while her husband ran an associated record pressing plant. According to songwriter Doc Pomus, she was \"very tough... a very strong, aggressive woman.\" When she gave up the business after becoming ill in 1954, Cash Box described her as \"the only woman ever able to break through with outstanding success in the male-dominated recording industry.\" She died in 1968, although some sources give a date in 1997.

  "text" : "Bridget Sabina Gilling, née Fisher (1922 – 2009) was an English-born Australian feminist and social activist. She was born in London and raised in Sussex amid a politically active family. Her grandparents, Charles and Marie Corbett, were active in the Liberal Party; her mother Cicely and aunt Dame Margery Corbett Ashby were prominent suffragists. Her father, Chalmers \"Pat\" Fisher, was an Irish Quaker who worked as a journalist and businessman. Bridget spent a year in Geneva in the late 1930s before serving as a nurse with the Voluntary Aid Detachment during World War II. During this time she met Douglas Gilling, an Australian serving in the navy; they were engaged three days after they met and married eleven days later, and they both moved to Australia in 1946. The Gillings settled in Castlecrag, and had four children. Bridget graduated from the University of Sydney in social work in 1971, and was appointed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Mental Health Review Tribunal, and as an ombudsman in the New South Wales prison system. She was chair of the Australian Consumers Association board, and was also involved with the Prison Reform Council, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Women's Electoral Lobby, the Council for Civil Liberties, and Zero Population Growth. She was president of the Humanist Society and the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, and ran for several elections during the early 1970s as a member of the Australia Party. In 1975 she joined the Australian Labor Party, remaining an active member until her death. Gilling received particular attention as a campaigner for birth control and abortion law reform. She was also involved in the campaign against the Hawke Government's Australia Card proposal in 1987, becoming a trustee of the Australian Privacy Foundation. She separated from her husband in the 1970s but they remained on good terms. She died at a nursing home in the Blue Mountains in 2009 and was survived by her ex-husband and their children, who included the actress Rebecca Gilling."

Gray joined the Saskatchewan Roughriders as a rookie in 1961 and rushed for 312 yards (5.8 yards per carry) and 25.9 yards per kick return. He earned his chance to start on offense in 1962 after an injury to Ray Purdin, and quickly profited by it by rushing for 140 yards in a single game against the Montreal Alouettes. Although his yards per carry dipped to 4.5, 1962 was his best year with 673 rushing yards and 30 receptions for 419 yards. However, the following year, Gray was hampered by injuries and replaced by Ed Buchanan, eventually playing behind him in 1964 and 1965 until signing with the Montreal Alouettes. But he was then released on 19 July 1966."

He contributed liner notes to archival soul reissues, as well as providing materials and assistance for releases on the Chicago-based Numero Group record label. He graduated from Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge, Illinois and received an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago in computer science and media studies. Abrahamian's 2009 interview with Larry Blasingaine resulted in the discovery of the Jackson 5's previously unknown first recording session at Chicago's One-derful Records.

  "text" : "John Bernard Caraher (born about 1938), known as Ben Caraher, is a former politician in Northern Ireland. Caraher grew up in Crossmaglen and attended Queen's University Belfast, where he became active in the Irish nationalist New Ireland Society, although he saw himself principally as a supporter of the British Labour Party. He then became a founder member of the National Democratic Party (NDP). Caraher became a teacher of English and politics, working in Belfast grammar school. The NDP became part of the new Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and Caraher immediately became one of its main political theorists. He was part of the team which drafted the party's constitution, organised the Belfast section of the party, and was elected as its first vice-chairman. Caraher stood unsuccessfully for the SDLP on numerous occasions: in South Belfast at the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election; in Belfast Area A at the Northern Ireland local elections, 1973; in the South Belfast Parliament constituency at the February and October 1974 general elections; in the 1975 Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention election in the equivalent Assembly seat; in Belfast Area C at the Northern Ireland local elections, 1981; and finally at the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election. It was in 1982 that he came closest to winning a seat, taking fourth place, but narrowly missing out on transfers. At the Northern Ireland local elections, 1985, Caraher acted as election agent for Dorita Field, who stood unsuccessfully in the Balmoral area."

Originally from Morocco, Bruno is the third and last child of a Sicilian family. In 1970 the Catalano family left Morocco for France. In 1982 he started working at the Société Nationale maritime Corse Méditerranée. He stayed there 4 years until 1986. He cites his experience as a sailor as central to his inspiration. Catalano was acquainted with sculpting in 1981 in Marseille where he enrolled in Françoise Hamel’s modeling classes. After two years of education, he opened his own art practise in 1985 and secured an oven in which he would bake his first clay figure. Later Catalano began to make big bronze sculptures. His first works were compact and conventional but the later series become increasingly expressive. In 2004 a flaw in one of his characters – a depiction of Cyrano – prompted him to dig and hollow out the chest. A new path of work ensues. An exhibition took place in Marseille in September 2013, to celebrate its status as the European Capital of Culture with ten life-size sculptures exhibited at the port of Marseille."

His recent academic research centred on engineering of antibodies for application in health care, management of environmental pollution, and the derivation and use of novel combinatorial libraries. In early 2015, Bill was celebrated as a pioneering bio-entrepreneur by the University of Aberdeen during a two-day symposium at the Institute of Medical sciences. Bill lived in Carnoustie, Scotland, known as one of the most challenging golf course in the world where the Open Championship was held in 1999 and 2007. He played this golf course every week and was formerly a committee member of The Carnoustie Golf Club, established 1842. In 2013, he published the book 'Sons of Carnoustie', which followed from his research  into former golfers of Carnoustie who are thought to have spread golf around the world, known as the 'Sons of Carnoustie'. His research identified 163 such golfers from Carnoustie and his book tells of their lives and experiences. He also published a book of poetry in 2005, \"thoughts and memories'."

He finished fourth in the 85-kg division at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, and later represented his nation Iran, as a 31-year-old, at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Jamshidi also trained for Wrestling Club Takhti in Izhe suburb, under his personal coach Vali Mohammadi Babak. Jamshidi emerged into the international spotlight at the 1999 World Wrestling Championships in Athens, Greece, where he took home the bronze medal in the 85-kg division. On January 3, 2000, the International Federation of Associated Wrestling (FILA) had decided to strip Jamshidi's medal and ordered him a two-year suspension for being tested positive on doping, missing out his opportunity to compete at the Summer Olympics in Sydney. When his suspension went expired in September 2001, Jamshidi returned again to wrestling and competed in several international tournaments, including the World and Asian Championships, but achieved mediocre results and left empty-handed. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Jamshidi qualified for the Iranian squad on his official Olympic status in the men's 84 kg class. Earlier in the process, he finished first and received a berth from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. Jamshidi lost his opening match to Greece's Dimitrios Avramis with a 1–3 decision much to the massive cheer from the home crowd inside Ano Liossa Olympic Hall, but eventually edged Norway's Fritz Aanes in a three-point overtime decision in the second round. Finishing the pool in second place and ninth overall, Jamshidi's performance was not enough to put him further into the quarterfinals."

McRoberts' first political contest came when he stood unsuccessfully for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in South Armagh at the Northern Ireland general election, 1962. He next stood for the UUP in Belfast West at the 1970 general election, when he was described by opponent Gerry Fitt as \"one of the most reactionary candidates to contest Belfast West\". His campaign headquarters were bombed on the election day, although there were no injuries. He was again unsuccessful in the election, although he took 47.2% of the vote. McRoberts was involved in controversy when his secretary, Emily Roberts, obtained a newly built three-bedroom council house in Dungannon, despite being unmarried and only nineteen years old, and while many Roman Catholic families had been waiting for housing for years. In his spare time, McRoberts was a prominent member of the Masonic Order."

  "text" : "Beryl Randle (born 16 December 1928) is a former race walker and an athletics administrator. She raced for Birchfield Harriers. She took up competitive walking in 1946, after coming last in a 100-metre sprint, and was coached by Dorothy Nelson Neal. To train, she would walk from her home in Walsall to her workplace in Digbeth, Birmingham, and back - 18 miles (29 km) each day. On 29 May 1954, she broke the world record for the one-mile walk, with a time of 7 minutes 49 seconds. On 19 June 1954, she shaved over ten seconds from her own record, at the White City Stadium, with a time of 7 minutes 38.4 seconds. In doing so, she became the Women's Amateur Athletic Association Champion. She was honoured for this achievement with a brooch depicting the stag logo of Birchfield Harriers in solid gold, commissioned by G.H. Alexander, then president of the club. She later said: I remember finishing the walk with a last gasp supreme effort. I had no idea I was going to break the world record because Nelson our coach was the sort of person who would not give away any times in training which meant that I had no idea what sort of shape that I was in that day... I just went for it from the start. Randle is a six-time Midland mile track champion, four-time British mile track champion, and three-time Midland road-walking champion. After winning £1,000 for coming in second in a 1960 John O'Groats–Land's End walk sponsored by Billy Butlin – she lost the lead to Wendy Lewis after twisting her ankle – she had to relinquish her amateur status, though it was later restored, and she resumed competing. During the 1980s, she coached Birchfield Harriers' girls' teams. At the age of 71, she broke the over-70s age group world record for the 3000-metres walk. She was Honorary General Secretary of the Race Walking Association from 1988 to 1991, and its President from 1996 to 1998. She was subsequently made an Honorary Life Member, and was given their lifetime achievement award in 2014. In 2009, she was elected President of the Midland Counties Athletics Association."

  "text" : "Bartolino (Bertolino) Ploti da Novara (died 1406-1410) was an Italian military architect and engineer. He was in the service of the Este that in the city of Ferrara in 1376 presented him with a palace in which he lived also his descendant Domenico Maria Novara teacher of Copernicus and in 1385 for those gentlemen designed the Estense Castle. In 1395 he was at the court of Francesco Gonzaga. For the Lord of Mantua, at the beginning of the fifteenth century, he made major architectural and urban interventions in the area of the court and of the bishopric, which were demolished some old churches such as Santa Maria and Santa Croce in Capodibove to make way for the building of the castle Gonzaga. He was also commissioned by Francis to build the Shrine of Our Lady of Grace. In 1402 began the construction of the fortress of Finale Emilia, which was enlarged in 1425 to a design by Giovanni da Siena for Niccolò III d'Este. In 1404 he was responsible for the construction of defensive bastions along the Po. As a military engineer, he had assignments by the Visconti of Milan and the Lordship De 'Medici of Florence."

  "text" : "Bashir Yusuf Ibrahim (born January 23, 1961) is a Nigerian politician and businessman. He is the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM), a Nigerian political party. The PDM, which initially started out as a movement formed in the wake of Nigerians' agitation for a democratic state, was denied registration as an official political party by the Abacha regime. Upon the country's return to democracy, the movement, hence, formed a major building block of what would become Nigeria's ruling party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP). After years of running the country's affairs and a seeming disconnect between what had been envisioned and what had, in fact, been achieved by the PDP, some members of the PDM decided to leave the PDP and register the movement as a party, so that it could abide by the ideals which guided its formation. The PDM was, thus, registered in 2013, with Bashir as the chairman. Mentored by the late Aminu Kano, Bashir has had a public service career spanning several decades, serving in various capacities including that of Special Adviser to both President Olusegun Obasanjo and Vice-President Atiku Abubakar at varying stages of their tenures, and on several committees including the Justice Niki Tobi Committee on the 1999 Constitution, among others. He is a fellow of the Nigerian Leadership Initiative and the Aspen Institute."

Bianca Milesi was born into a family of wealthy merchants in Milan, daughter of Giovan Battista Milesi and Elena Viscontini. She had four sisters, Antoinette, Francesca, Agostina, Louise, and a brother, Charles, who would join in marriage with his cousin Elena Viscontini, sister of Matilda. She was brought up from six to ten years in a convent in Florence, in Milan in the monasteries of St. Sophia and the Holy Spirit, and finally with a governess. A journey made together with her mother in Tuscany and Switzerland gave her the opportunity to broaden her horizons and study the philosophy of the Enlightenment. Even after returning to Milan, she continued to travel, periodically visiting Florence and Rome. In Florence he met the Countess of Albany Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, who had been the mistress of Vittorio Alfieri. In Rome she came into relationship with Antonio Canova and the German painter Sophie Reinhard. She had a leading role in the Carbonari uprisings in Milan in 1821. She later went on to become a drawer and painter, and taught at schools, particularly training girls to become interested in the arts. She died in Paris on June 8, 1849."

  "text" : "Barry Voight (born 1937) is an American volcanologist and engineer. He is also the brother of actor Jon Voight and songwriter Chip Taylor, and the uncle of actress Angelina Jolie and actor James Haven. After attending a five-year intensive dual-degree program at the University of Notre Dame, Voight became a teaching assistant there while pursuing his Master's degree. He studied at Cornell University and Columbia University, earning his Ph.D. in geology at the latter in 1965. He worked as a professor of geology at several universities, including Pennsylvania State University, where he taught from 1964 until his retirement in 2005.Voight's publication on avalanches and other mass movements attracted the attention of United States Geological Survey (USGS) employee Rocky Crandell, who asked him to look at an expanding bulge at Mount St. Helens in Washington. Voight foresaw the bulge's failure, followed by the collapse of the mountain's north flank as well as a powerful eruption. His predictions came true as St. Helens erupted in 1980; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the avalanche that marked the eruption. After his work at St. Helens brought him international recognition, Voight continued researching and guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career, including Nevado del Ruiz, Mount Merapi, and Soufrière Hills. For his research, publications, and disaster prevention work as a volcanologist and engineer, Voight has been honored with several awards and citations as a lecturer."

He married Mona C Barrett-Lennard, his second wife, in December 1926 in Lambeth, London. Hilliam also wrote music and lyrics, such as Ladies of Leamington, and was musical director, for the stage play Buddies, and starred in his own concert-party shows, 'Flotsam's Follies', whose cast included a young Tony Hancock. Hilliam was born in Scarborough, North Yorkshire in 1890, as Bentley Collingwood Smailes. He began his career as an entertainer at local functions, under the name Lloyd Holland, and also attended the local boys' school Scarborough College from 1902 to 1906. Hilliam wrote a series of odes for the school magazine under the pseudonym Aimless, an anagram of Smailes. He later changed his name permanently from Smailes to Hilliam. During World War I, he served as a Lieutenant in the Canadian Engineers. In 1935 he appeared in court after his first wife attempted to have him declared bankrupt for failure to pay alimony. His address was given as residing at Cadnam, Hampshire, England, and formerly West Hill, Highgate, London. On 23 May 1935, a conditional order of discharge was made. The case continued, with an adjournment in October of that year, when his address was given as Robin Grove, West Hill. He appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 3 August 1959."

Holding a dual citizenship to compete internationally, Aslanasvili has been selected to the nation's Olympic wrestling team when Greece hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, and also picked up a gold medal in the 63-kg division at the 2001 Mediterranean Games in Tunis, Tunisia. Throughout his sporting career, Aslanasvili trained full-time for Atlas Kallitheas Wrestling Club in Athens, under personal coach Michail Charachura. Aslanasvili qualified for the naturalized Greek squad in the men's lightweight class (60 kg), when Greece welcomed the world to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. He filled up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling and the Hellenic Olympic Committee, as Greece received an automatic berth for being the host nation. Amassed the home crowd inside Ano Liossia Olympic Hall, Aslanasvili opened the prelim pool with a shut out 5–2 victory over neighboring Albania's Sahit Prizreni, before losing to Iran's Masoud Mostafa-Jokar by a rigid 3–2 decision. Placing second in the pool and eleventh in the final standings, Aslanasvili's performance was not enough to put him further into the medal rounds."

  "text" : "Bill Sipper is a beverage pioneer having grown up in the beverage industry with a father who was the first importer/distributor of Perrier, Evian, San Pellegrino, SPA water, Orangina, among others. His father is widely considered to be the \"Bottled Water King\" in the United States and is credited with helping to create the bottled water category in the 1970s in the USA. Bill Sipper worked weekends, holidays and summers in the family business. After attending Hofstra University, Sipper joined Evian Natural Spring Water and was responsible for developing Evian, and another Evian owned brand called Saratoga Mineral Water, in New York city in the late 1980s. He joined the family business as Vice President of Sales at Mootch and Muck, the largest distributor of bottled waters and new age beverages. He didn't stay in the family business long as he chose to leave the world of distribution for beverage manufacturing, marketing, and sales as Vice President of Chatham Beverages. Chatham owned Clearly Canadian, Old Tyme Soda, and New Amsterdam Beer. Sipper stumbled across a bottle of Nantucket Nectars Orange Mango at a local deli near his NYC office. Falling in love with the product, Sipper contacted Tom First and Tom Scott and joined them as Director of National Sales. He left his comfortable office on Park Avenue South to help build a company where employees often slept on other employee's floors because they could not afford to pay for hotel rooms. Sipper helped grow the brand dramatically and was there when Nantucket Nectars was sold to Ocean Spray. Sipper joined another startup, Saco, Maine smoothie maker Fresh Samantha, after leaving Nantucket Nectars, as Vice President of Sales, Marketing, Distribution, and Operations. The brand was only sold in New England and New York City at that time and Sipper helped launch the brand in all major markets along the east coast. Fresh Samantha merged with Odwalla, the name of Fresh Samantha also changed to Odwalla, and was sold to Coca Cola. Sipper became President and Chief Operating Office of Robert Kennedy, Jr.'s not for profit bottled water company Keeper Springs. He changed much of the internal workings at the company and eventually signed a licensing agreement with Vermont Pure Spring Water. Subsequently a licensing agreement was signed with Nestle Waters and Keeper Springs has been able to donate over $1,000,000 to the Water Keeper Alliance and Riverkeeper, two of the charities Kennedy was looking to raise money for. Once the licensing agreements were signed Sipper left to join Ultimate Juice Company as Vice President of Marketing. Ultimate Juice Company owned Naked Juice, Fantasia Fresh Juice, Hansen's Juice, Zeigler's Apple Cider, and had recently purchased Saratoga Mineral Water. Ultimate Juice Company, Naked Juice, was sold to Pepsi Cola several years later. Sipper started Cascadia Consulting Group several years later and merged with Managing Brands in 2011 forming Cascadia Managing Brands, one of the beverage industry's leading branding, consulting, and brand management firms. Casacadia's clients include Bain & Company, Beverage Marketing Corporation, Bevnet.com, Zenith International, the Marilyn Monroe Estate, and brands including Zico Coconut Water—now owned by Coca Cola, Hint Water (a Verlinvest invested company), C2O Coconut Water, RealBeanz, Balance Water, Wat-aah, RealBeanz, 'tude Juice, and many others. Sipper has been a two time member of the Board of Directors of the National Osteoporosis Foundation, and Advisory Board Member of the Walden Woods Project, a board member of Ramsey Junior Youth Lacrosse and has served as coach of the local youth Baseball, Basketball, and Lacrosse teams. He lives in Ramsey, NJ with his wife, two children, and dog."

  "text" : "Brian P. Levack (born 1943) is an American historian of early modern Britain and Europe. He received his B.A. (summa cum laude) from Fordham University in 1965 and his Ph.D. from Yale in 1970. In 1969 he joined the History Department of the University of Texas at Austin, where he is now the John E. Green Regents Professor in History. His research interests center on the history of the law, the relationship between law and politics in early modern Britain, the formation of the British state, witch-hunting, and demonic possession. Levack is most widely known for his book The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe (3rd edition, 2006), a comparative survey of witch-hunting throughout the early modern world that has been translated into eight languages. He has edited twenty books, including The Jacobean Union: Six Tracts of 1604 (1985) and The Witchcraft Sourcebook (2004). His most recent book, The Devil Within: Possession and Exorcism in the Christian West (2013), challenges the commonly held belief that possession signals physical or mental illness and argues that demoniacs and exorcists—consciously or not—are following their various religious cultures, and their performances can only be understood in those contexts.The recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1975, Levack was appointed Scholar in Residence at the Frances Lewis Law Center, Washington and Lee University School of Law, in 1994. At Texas he was admitted to the Academy of Distinguished Teachers in 2004, and in 2011 he received the University of Texas Regents Outstanding Teaching Award. Levack offers a wide variety of courses on early modern British and European history, legal history, and the history of witchcraft. For eight years he served as the chair of his department."

  "text" : "Aaron James Loder, professionally known as Bananasaurus Rex, is a Twitch.tv streamer and a video game speedrunner. Loder was the first to successfully perform a solo eggplant run in Derek Yu's roguelike platformer Spelunky. An eggplant run is a very luck-based and challenging endeavor originally meant for co-op play only. It was thought impossible to do solo. Loder started his speedrunning career with Portal 2. He was able to simultaneously hold world records for 48 of the 51 levels at once. Since summer 2013, Aaron has been streaming regularly on Twitch.tv. At first, he mainly streamed speedruns of Spelunky, though after building up a large enough fan base to obtain a Twitch partnership, he was able to quit his main job and continue livestreaming on a full-time basis. He found his niche as a variety streamer, streaming a wide range of games ranging from indie to triple A. Besides Portal 2, Rex has also done speedruns of Dustforce, Paranautical Activity, Risk of Rain, Spelunky, Dark Souls II, 1001 Spikes and Wings of Vi. He has held speedrunning world records in all of these games. In September 2015, he became the first person to beat PangaeaPanga's infamously difficult Super Mario Maker level \"Bomb Voyage\", succeeding after a collective effort of over 11,000 failed attempts."

Bartolomeo was born, and lived and worked his whole life in Florence. Part of the indecision about his age and birth year comes from differing statements he had made: in 1427 he gave 61, and 64 in 1433. His brother, Giovanni, was a sculptor and possibly a painter as well. Bartolomeo was enrolled in the Guild of Saint Luke of Florence with Agnolo Gaddi since 1394, and worked on the design of the Cappella del Sacro Cingolo of the Prato Cathedral. Between 1402 and 1438, he received many orders for the new hospital of St. Mary, and he died wealthy. He never married. He was also influenced by Lorenzo Monaco. One illumination of a missal of the church San'Egidio in 1421 was signed by him, all other work has been assigned. His works can be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Galleria dell'Accademia, and San Marco, Florence."

  "text" : "Baqet III was an ancient Egyptian official and Great Chief of the Oryx nome (the 16th nome of Upper Egypt) during the 11th Dynasty (21st century BCE, toward the end of the First Intermediate Period). As a son of his predecessor Ramushenty, he administered his governorate from the city of Men'at Khufu. Realizing that the fate of the civil war was definitely in favor of the Thebans led by Mentuhotep II, Baqet cunningly broke the long neutrality of his territory and took the Theban side. After his death, his new loyalty allowed him to be succeeded by his probable son Khety and by his descendants until the time of Amenemhat I, when a family turnover took place in the governorship with the installation of Khnumhotep I. In addition to the office of governor of the entire nome, Baqet also was haty-a, treasurer of the king of Lower Egypt, confidential friend, true royal acquaintance, and mayor of Nekheb."

  "text" : "Bakenrenef or Bakenranef was an ancient Egyptian Vizier of the North (Lower Egypt) during the reign of Psamtik I (664 – 610 BC) of the 26th Dynasty. Like Khaemwaset several centuries before, he bore the title of Iunmutef, “Cleaner of the Great House”. His father was a mayor called Padineit, while his mother was a certain Tageb. Bakenrenef is mainly known for his large rock tomb in Saqqara and its reliefs depicting scenes from the Book of the Dead and from the Amduat. The tomb was later reused for other burials during the 30th Dynasty. The decoration of the tomb was still largely intact when the Lepsius expedition discovered and copied it, in the middle of the 19th century. Since then, the grave has been vandalized: most reliefs were torn away from the walls and sold to various museums and private collectors. For about twenty years an Italian expedition worked here and Bakenrenef's limestone sarcophagus is now in the National Archaeological Museum of Florence."

  "text" : "Bella Ratchinskaia is a classical ballet choreographer, maÎtre de ballet.Born in Vorkuta (Russia) on 22.11.1953 she attended and graduated with honours at the State Academy of Ballet in Perm. After her studies, she joined the USSR \"All-Union Contest\" for young dancers and moved to Leningrad (San Petersburg) where she started a classical dance career at the Theatre. In 1972 she began to work as a principal dancer in the company \"Choreographical Miniatures\" directed by Leonid Yakobson, she performed all roles of the classical repertory and Yakobson's own choreographical creations. She enjoyed critical acclaim during international tours for her interpretation of these roles. In 1976, she took her first steps in creating her own choreography. The approval she received from the Soviet public encouraged her to follow a pedagogical and choreographic career. In the same year she began the renowned Teachers course at The Vaganova Ballet Academy. After graduation with honours and receiving the official title of Pedagogue for Classical, Historical, Character Ballet and Repertoire she began teaching at the Vaganova Academy. During the years while working in the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet, another important field of activity was a close collaboration with the Ministry of Culture of Mongolia, developing educational methods for the training of classical ballet for both students and teachers. Her professional success, was rewarded, in 1989, with the 'Honorary Board and Symbol of Ministry of Culture' of the USSR and Mongolia.

She was born on 14 July 1906, the daughter of Brian Kemp-Welch of Kineton, Warwickshire, England, and was educated by a governess, and at a finishing school at Les Tourelles, Brussels, Belgium. Her brother was the cricketer George Kemp-Welch who married the eldest daughter of Stanley Baldwin. She married Captain Peter Kenward of the 14th/20th King's Hussars at St Margaret's, Westminster, in 1932, and adopted his name. They divorced in 1942, leaving her with a nine-year-old son. To pay his fees at Winchester School, she worked as a dame (house matron) at Eton College. Her Tatler column was originally called \"On and Off Duty in Town and Country\", becoming \"Jennifer's Diary\" in 1945. She took it to Queen (later Harpers & Queen) in 1959. She retired in 1991, when she was aged 84. Her obituary in The Daily Telegraph described her as \"insufferably snobbish and crotchety\" and noted her long-running feud with Margaret, Duchess of Argyll and snubbing of Tatler's social editor, Peter Townend. She appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 14 December 1974. She was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1986. Her autobiography, Jennifer's Memoirs: Eighty-Five Years of Fun and Functions, was published in 1992. She died in February 2001."

  "text" : "Bernardino Borgognone (1455/60–1525) was an Italian Renaissance painter of the Milanese school. Bernardino grew up and worked in the Lombardy region. He was the chief assistant to his brother and fellow painter Ambrogio Bergognone on important projects in Lombardy in the 1490s. Their use of mordant (the adhesive to which the gold leaf is attached) gilding in their art is distinctive. Bernardino's style of painting appears influenced by fellow Lombard painter Vincenzo Foppa. The National Gallery, London, has one of his works: The Virgin and Child with Two Angels. The name Bernardino can be read on the hem of the Virgin's mantle. This work shows stylistic similarities with his brother Ambrogio at the time of their collaboration at the Certosa di Pavia, composed of the church and convent of the Carthusians. He worked there with his brother furnishing the designs of the figures of the virgin, saints and apostles for the choir-stalls, executed in tarsia or inlaid wood work by Bartolomeo Pola."

  "text" : "Bobby Marlow (c. 1930 – 1985) was a former American and Canadian football running back who played for the University of Alabama and the Canadian Football League's (CFL) Saskatchewan Roughriders. Born in Athens, Alabama, Marlow moved to Troy at an early age. He played high school football at Troy High School before playing college football for the University of Alabama from 1950 to 1952. In 1950, Marlow's first season with the Crimson Tide, he had 118 rushing attempts, gaining 882 yards for an average of 7.5 per carry, and scored 9 touchdowns. His number of touchdowns doubled to 12 in 1951, as he rushed for 728 yards in 114 carries. In that year's Iron Bowl against Auburn, Marlow had 233 rushing yards, breaking the team record; his mark was not bested until 1987. In 1952, he was named to the All-America Team, after running for 950 yards in 176 attempts and scoring 10 touchdowns. In Marlow's Crimson Tide career, the team had a win–loss record of 24–10 and won the 1953 Orange Bowl. At the end of his college career, Marlow had a school-record 2,560 rushing yards. The record lasted until 1971, and he remains among the top 10 in career rushing yards at Alabama. The New York Giants selected Marlow with the eighth overall pick in the first round of the 1953 NFL Draft. However, he did not play in the NFL, and instead signed to play in the CFL. The Roughriders ultimately signed Marlow. In his career with the Roughriders, he scored 34 touchdowns and had 4,291 rushing yards in 833 attempts. Marlow spent eight seasons in Canada, and later lived in Elkmont, Alabama and Houston, Texas. In 1985, Marlow suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 55. Marlow was named a member of the CFL's All Star All-Time Team."

The stranded men had been shipwrecked in a heavy storm for 90 hours, five miles, or seven miles, off the coast of Cape Hatteras.According to Life magazine Dailey explained in his report to superiors that he wasn't able to draft a report on the rescue for seven days as his hands were too raw from the exertion.(Main article: Wreck of the Ephraim Williams)\nThe US National Park Service's has preserved Dailey's US Coast Guard Gold Lifesaving Medal at its Hatteras Museum. In 2014 the Coast Guard published a list of ten individuals who were to be namesakes for Sentinel class cutters.All the Sentinel class cutters are to be named after men and women who have been recognized as heroes serving in the US Coast Guard, or a precursor service. Dailey was named in the second cohort of heroes, and the USCGC Benjamin B. Dailey will be launched in 2015, 2016 or 2017. David Stick, author of \"Graveyard of the Atlantic: Shipwrecks of the North Carolina Coast\", described the wills made out by Dailey and his crew, when he commanded the Creed's Hill Lifesaving Station in April 1881, prior to setting out on a particularly dangerous rescue effort."

  "text" : "William \"Bill\" Tomicki is an American travel writer. Since 1981 he is the publisher of the ENTREE Travel Newsletter, which has been called the “Rolls Royce of travel newsletters” where \"Each month Mr. Tomicki skewers the mediocre and exalts excellence so that his readers do not waste their time and money\"-New York Journal of Books. Tomicki claims he personally writes \"60 to 70 percent of the content based on his own travels.\" The Seattle Times calls him \"outspoken.\" Larry Mogelonsky calls him \"a well-heeled, globetrotting travel writer, (through his newsletter) he has provided readers with insider knowledge on hotels and restaurants.\" A good review from Tomicki is republished or becomes quoted in advertising. He practices what he writes about, the art of \"Extreme Travel.\" The wide variety places he has visited rolls off the tongue with a casual nature. He has visited over 100 countries. Will McGough of the Santa Barbara Entrepreneur calls him \"Santa Barbara’s version of “the most interesting man in the world.” He has single-handedly scaled a sacred aboriginal mountain in Australia, lived with Masai warriors in Kenya, danced on the Great Wall of China, climbed to the top of Angkor Wat at sundown, eaten piranhas in the Brazilian Amazon, hunted jaguars in Belize, galloped horses through the royal woods of Versailles, boxed with heavyweight champ Mike Weaver, bicycled through Tuscany, witnessed private voodoo ceremonies in Haiti and ridden elephants at a palace in India. While there is a story behind every adventure some of Tomicki's accomplishments: \n*  The youngest Vice President in the history of Tiffany & Co. in New York \n*  Vice President of Sotheby’s before he turned 30 \n*  A successful real estate developer \n*  Member of The Explorers Club at age 21 \n*  Set to retire at age 39 \n*  Nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2006 \n*  Has been Knighted in France and Portugal \n*  Won a million dollars in a lottery, by accident He has also been Travel and Restaurant Editor for American-International News Syndicate, Travel Editor for El Paso Inc. Senior Editor for Traveler Overseas Magazine and a Contributor to the Zagat Survey Los Angeles. He has been a member of the International Food Wine & Travel Writers Association (IFWTWA) He is also a former syndicated Travel Writer for the New York Times. In an article, Tomicki asked if hoteliers ever spend time in their own hotels. “We guess not, judging by the missteps we find so often, like square soaps, soaps that are wrapped too tightly with plastic or paper … We hate soap dispensers in the bath, phones we cannot figure out, lighting that takes a visit from the engineer to decipher and any hotel that puts so much reading crap in the room that you can’t find a place for your own crap. And stop turning the radio on when we are not there, please. And not coming back for the room service table.”— Santa Barbara Independent"

  "text" : "Bartolomeo Biasoletto (24 April 1793, Dignano – 17 January 1858, Trieste) was an Italian pharmacist, botanist and phycologist. In 1814 he received his degree in pharmacy at the University of Vienna, and after a short period of time working in Wels, he travelled to Trieste, where in 1817 he took over ownership of the Orso Negro pharmacy. In 1819 he met with David Heinrich Hoppe, director of the Regensburg Botanical Society, with whom he established a close friendship and a partnership for research. In 1820 he became a founding member of the pharmaceutical guild in Trieste, under the aegis of which, he later created the first botanical garden in Trieste. In 1823 he obtained his PhD from the University of Padua. He is best known for his investigations of flora found in Istria and Carniola, and also for his studies of marine algae. In 1836, in the retinue of Friedrich Augustus II of Saxony (who had a passion for botany), he participated in an extended excursion to Istria, Dalmatia and Montenegro, about which, he published the treatise Viaggio di S.M. Federico Augusto re di Sassonia per l’Istria, Dalmazia e Montenegro (1841). In 1837, Wilhelm Daniel Joseph Koch, a professor at the University of Erlangen, named the genus Biasolettia (synonym Geocaryum) in his honor."

With the National Organization for Women, Love organized and participated in demonstrations, such as the demonstration against The New York Times which resulted in the integration of the want ads which helped support improvements towards equal pay for equal work. She also worked within the organization to improve the acceptance of lesbian feminists within the organization. She helped to found consciousness-raising groups for lesbian feminists and was active in the gay liberation movement. Her mother supported her at gay rights and gay pride marches. With her lover and fellow feminist, Sidney Abbott, she co-authored the classic book Sappho was a Right-on Woman: A Liberated View of Lesbianism that she would hope would lead to greater awareness of society oppression of women and lesbians. She helped in the presentation to the American Psychiatric Association (APA) which led to the removal of homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)."

Crane works with a variety of materials including Polaroid, gelatin silver, and platinum prints among others. She is known for her experimental and innovative work that challenges the straight photograph by incorporating sequencing, layered negatives, and repeated frames. Naomi Rosenblum notes that Crane \"pioneered the use of repetition to convey the mechanical character of much of contemporary life, even in its recreational aspects.\" Crane has been the recipient of fellowships and grants, such as the Illinois Arts Council Artists Fellowship (2001), National Endowment for the Arts Grant (1988, 1974), Polaroid Corporation Materials Grants (1979-1995), and John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship in Photography (1979). Crane has also been an honored educator for the National Society for Photographic Education (1993); a distinguished artist at the Union League Club in Chicago, Illinois (2006); and a distinguished artist at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island (2006). Her awards also include the YWCA Outstanding Achievement Award (1987) and the Ruth Horwich Award to a Famous Chicago Artist (Chicago, Illinois, 2009). In 2013, Barbara Crane was named artist honoree at the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago, Illinois. Crane's work is represented in numerous public collections including the International Center for Photography, New York City; the International Museum of Photography, George Eastman House, Rochester; the Art Institute of Chicago; the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto, Japan; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; and the WestLicht Museum of Photography, Vienna, Austria.

  "text" : "Bernard Renault (4 March 1836, Autun – 16 October 1904) was a French paleobotanist. He was a specialist in regard to the anatomy of Carboniferous and Permo-Carboniferous Era flora. In 1867 he earned his doctorate in physical sciences at Paris, followed by work as an instructor of chemistry at the college in Cluny (1867–72). Later on, he was associated with the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris, serving as a préparateur (1872–76) and an assistant naturalist (1876–1904). In 1879 he obtained his doctorate in natural sciences. During his tenure at Cluny, he developed an interest in paleobotany. He conducted studies of fossil flora in the vicinity of his hometown of Autun, an area abundant in silicified remains of plants dating from the Permo-Carboniferous Age. His studies of fossil ferns led to the founding of a new plant family, Botryopterideae. He also made important findings concerning the anatomy of the extinct genus Sphenophyllum, as well as to the anatomy and reproductive aspects of the extinct genus Annularia. His work caught the attention of Adolphe Brongniart, who subsequently offered him a position at the natural history museum in Paris. With Brongniart, he conducted investigations of silicified seeds. He is credited as the first scientist to account for all organs of the extinct conifer family Cordaitaceae. The genus Renaultia was named in his honour by Charles René Zeiller (1883). He was a member of the Société éduenne des lettres, sciences et arts (from 1867), the Société linnéenne de Normandie, the Institut géologique de Vienne, and in 1884, was deputy associate of the Carte géographique de France project. In 1886 he was a founding member and first president of the Société d'histoire naturelle et des amis du muséum d'Autun."

She also wrote for Executive Suite and Fish, a 1977-78 spin-off from Barney Miller. With Barbara Corday, Avedon created Cagney & Lacey, the world's first dramatic television series to place women in both of its starring roles. They came up with the idea for this television series after having read Molly Haskell's book From Reverence to Rape which stated that there had never been a female buddy film. Avedon and Corday initially intended Cagney & Lacey to be a film. While they were writing the series together, Avedon was more experienced and proficient in screenwriting than Corday, and Avedon mentored Corday in this area throughout the series. They were best friends for nearly a decade."

  "text" : "Bertha Lamme Feicht (December 16, 1869 – November 20, 1943) was an American engineer. In 1893, she became the first woman to receive a degree in engineering from the Ohio State University. She is considered to be the first American woman to graduate in a main discipline of engineering other than civil engineering. She was born Bertha Lamme on her family's farm in Bethel Township near Springfield, Ohio on December 16, 1869. After graduating from Olive Branch High School in 1889, she followed in her brother, Benjamin G. Lamme's footsteps and enrolled at Ohio State that fall. She graduated in 1893 with a degree in mechanical engineering with a specialty in electricity. Her thesis was titled \"An Analysis of Tests of a Westinghouse Railway Generator.\" The student newspaper reported that there was an outbreak of spontaneous applause when she received her degree. She was then hired by Westinghouse as its first female engineer. She worked there until she married Russell S. Feicht, her supervisor and fellow Ohio State alumnus, on 14 December 1905. She had one child, Florence, born in 1910, who became a physicist for the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Bertha Lamme Feicht died in Pittsburgh on 20 November 1943 and was buried in Homewood Cemetery. Her husband Russell died in April 1949. Some of her personal effects, including her slide rule, T-square, and diploma, are housed in the collections of the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh. The Westinghouse Educational Foundation, in conjunction with the Society of Women Engineers, created a scholarship named for her in 1973."

  "text" : "Bruno Fehrenbacher (*27.07.1895 in Mengen, Württemberg as Hermann Fehrenbacher; †18.07.1965 in Buckfast) was a German-British Benedictine monk and Abbot of Buckfast Abbey in Devon (England). Hermann Fehrenbacher was one of five children of a German Catholic family. At the grammar school in Mengen he came into contact with a Benedictine monk from Buckfast; at the age of 15 he - like numerous other young men from the south of Germany - became a member of the Buckfast Abbey community. At that time this community was looking for workers to help with the rebuilding of the abbey which had been in ruins for centuries. The then Abbot Ansgar (Martin) Vonier and his predecessor Abbot Bonifaz (Anton) Natter came from the same area of Württemberg. In 1919 Fehrenbacher was ordained priest. He then studied philosophy at the Benedictine college of St. Anselmo (Rome) where he obtained his doctorate in 1922. Back in Buckfast, he became a British citizen in 1935. Between 1937 and 1939 he taught Syriac clergy at the Benedictine seminary in Jerusalem and in Charfet. After the death of Abbot Vonier on 26 December 1938 Fehrenbacher was elected as his successor and so returned to Buckfast. Abbot Bruno was installed on 24 February 1939; the abbatial blessing followed on 23 March 1939. During the war Buckfast did not suffer bomb damage and thus was able to provide a refuge for the staff and pupils of St Boniface's Catholic College, Plymouth. After the war Abbot Fehrenbacher succeeded in extending the monastery buildings considerably and in rebuilding and enlarging the organ. In 1956 he resigned from his position as abbot because of ill-health. He then served as assistant chaplain to the Benedictine nuns of Stanbrook near Worcester. In 1964 he returned to Buckfast. He died in July 1965 shortly before his seventieth birthday."

This record store still stands today, and was the first Spanish-language music shop opened in the United States. He was the father of five children. Inspired as a youngster by hearing Rafael Hernández play at nearby Almacenes Hernández, Bartolo went on to found Alba and Rival Records, recording some of the era's most popular artists. Unlike the mega-music stores of today, Casa Latina and other neighborhoods music stores were gathering places for local and visiting musicians. In 1948 Musician and entrepreneur Bartolo Alvarez establishes Casa Latina, a music and instrument shop that becomes the primary destination for Latin music lovers. In 1962, the store moves to 151 E. 116th street where it continues its reign as the longest-running music store in East Harlem. Hunter College, Central University of New York's \"Center for Puerto Rican Studies\" recently dedicated a special section to Mr. Alvarez's work. The \"Bartolo Alvarez Collection\" consists of .12 cubic feet of correspondence, song title sheets, music notes, writings, newspaper articles, concert programs, photographs, and music CD’s of Alvarez’s, from the period between 1953 and 1971. The collection was donated by Ewin Martinez Torres."

Shortly thereafter, he got a callback for the character of Ethan on USA Network's Necessary Roughness where he impressed and entertained the room, which led to booking the role. In April 2013, Cooper was cast as Chuck in 20th Century Fox's The Maze Runner.

  "text" : "Bruno Merz is a New Zealand multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter, who grew up in New Zealand to Dutch parents. Around the age of twenty, his search for ‘home’ led him as far from New Zealand as possible. Possessing only a cheap guitar, he traveled through France working on farms for food and pocket money, until he eventually found his way to Amsterdam. There, he worked a number of jobs and recorded his first album of demos of songs written during his travels, called Through Darkness into Day. One track from this album, \"Nine Sixteen\", was chosen as the iTunes/Starbucks pick of the week in 2009. Demand for shows grew as word spread and he recorded his first EP entitled Departing from Crowds in 2009, which has received critical praise. A track from this EP, \"For You Now\", was used in the soundtrack to the Hollywood film Life as We Know It, starring Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel.Merz currently resides in Leeds, England, where he also works as an illustrator – mainly for children’s books and graphic novels. In 2014, he returned temporarily to his homeland of New Zealand to record his latest full-length album Highways, which was released on 25 October 2014. Merz is also the co-author and illustrator of the critically praised children's book Fins, Fluff and Other Stuff, published by QED, part of the Quarto group. In 2015 he was commissioned to compose the music for a 40 minute children's ballet for Northern Ballet's production of Tortoise and the Hare, receiving critical praise."

  "text" : "Barney Kulok (born New York, USA, 1981) is an American artist and photographer who lives and works in New York City. Kulok earned a Bachelor of Arts from Bard College in 2005. His work has been exhibited nationally and internationally at the Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery (New York), Wentrup Gallery (Berlin), Elizabeth Kaufmann Galerie and de Pury & Luxembourg (Zurich), Shinsegae Gallery (Seoul, Incheon, Busan), and Galerie Hussenot (Paris), where he is represented. Following the New York debut of his collaborative video installation in Walls 'N' Things, a group exhibition of young artists curated by Clarissa Dalrymple at the Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery in 2005, Kulok was identified as one of the ten \"23-Year-old Masters\" by the Wall Street Journal. In that article artist Joel Sternfeld is quoted as introducing Kulok as a \"young Mozart.\" The New Yorker magazine called his 2007 solo exhibition \"a cunning and memorable debut,\" and critic Vince Aletti wrote \"Working in a black-and-white and color and in a wide range of scales, Kulok turns out extremely self-conscious pictures of mostly ordinary things: bouquets of fake flowers in a car's rear window, doorbells in a tenement foyer, a stained leatherette headrest, a wind-blown tree at night, a barn. But each of these images is tight, engaging an surprisingly elegant; the headrest is close to perfection.\" Publications of Kulok’s work have included essays by architect Steven Holl, filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn, curator Joel Smith (The Morgan Library & Museum), and art historians Svetlana Alpers (Professor Emerita, UC Berkley) and Laurie Dahlberg (Bard College). His work has been reviewed and/or featured in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, Artforum, Frieze, Bomb Magazine, Art Papers, Dossier, Aperture Magazine and Time Out NY, among others. A recipient of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s MCAF Grant, he has lectured at the New York Institute for the Humanities (New York University), Sarah Lawrence College, The University of Texas at Austin and the School of Visual Arts. Kulok’s work is in many private collections and in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, NY, The Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, and the Cleveland Clinic. In 2012 Aperture Foundation published Kulok’s first monograph, Building: Louis I. Kahn at Roosevelt Island, which was chosen as one of the Best Books of 2012 and described as “a poem in concrete, brick and rebar” by Photo Eye. Writing about Building for Frieze critic Chris Wiley observed, the “stunningly rich black-and-white photographs” “take into account the art historical precedents of Minimalism and Post-Minimalism, with a deftness that has had few parallels since the work of Lewis Baltz.” In its review of the exhibition Building at the Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery, Artforum called the “moody gelatin silver prints” “quietly thrilling,” and Art Papers wrote that Kulok has given architect Louis Kahn “the posthumous interpreter – clear-eyed, historically minded, informed but independent – that he deserves.” In 2013 Kulok was commissioned by Brian Sholis (Curator of Photography, Cincinnati Art Museum), then editor of Aperture magazine, to write Reflections on the Concrete Mirror, an essay about the relationship between photography and architecture. In 2014 Kulok was invited to co-edit, with artist Vik Muniz, the 20th Anniversary issue of Blind Spot Magazine."

  "text" : "Bennet Graham Burley (1840 – 1914) was a Scottish-born pirate, Confederate spy and journalist. Later in life, he changed his surname to Burleigh and became a celebrated war correspondent for the London Daily Telegraph. Born in Glasgow, he began work as a shipping clerk at the age of 20. Shortly afterwards, he was forced to marry one of the family's servants after getting her pregnant. Burley left for North America with another clerk to take part in the American Civil War. He joined the Confederates, disrupting Union ship traffic. Burley was captured in May 1864 but escaped a month later. He took part in a raid on Lake Erie in September 1864 led by John Yates Beall. Burley had convinced a Canadian cousin in Guelph, Adam Robertson, to manufacture munitions for use in that raid. He returned to Guelph but was later captured and extradited to the United States. The jury deadlocked at his first trial and he was returned to jail to await a second trial. Burley was able to escape to Canada and returned to Scotland. At this point, he changed his name to Bennet Burleigh. In 1881, Burleigh was hired by the London Telegraph to cover the war in Sudan. He was a correspondent for the Central News Agency during the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. Burleigh was the first to report the failure of the Gordon relief expedition, which led to the slaughter of the Khartoum garrison. He also covered the Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War. He authored several books on his experiences reporting on conflict. Burleigh ran unsuccessfully several times for Glasgow seats in the British parliament. He died in London in 1914. Burleigh is thought by some to be a model for the correspondent Gilbert Torpenhow in Rudyard Kipling's The Light that Failed."

Working with the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland, of which he is a leading member, he has helped to devise a system which enables patients waiting for heart surgery to check the track record of cardiac surgeons and their hospitals on-line before their operation. Measuring clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery has led to a 50% reduction in mortality rates over the past 10 years. He has also helped to create a system, working with the Picker Institute Europe to develop a system which makes public online data for all of University Hospital of South Manchester Trust's consultants. He was a vocal participant in the debate about the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Bridgewater is a member of Heart Valve Voice, an organisation which aims to address the under-diagnosis and under-treatment of people with heart valve disease in the United Kingdom, by raising awareness and understanding of the disease, and delivering up to date evidence based treatment guidance to ensure patients receive the right treatment at the right time. Most people are in their late 50s when diagnosed, and more than one in ten people over 75 have it."

Biggs was born in Carroll County, Maryland in 1819. His mother died when he was four. In the 1840s Biggs married Mary Jackson. They had seven children. They moved from Maryland to Gettysburg in 1858. Following the Battle of Gettysburg, Biggs was hired to disinter bodies from temporary cemeteries, place them in coffins, and rebury them. The work started on October 1863 and ended in March 1864. He was paid $1.25 per body and worked with a crew of laborers. Gettysburg's Unknown Soldier, Amos Humiston, was among the disinterred. Biggs used his earnings to purchase a farm in Gettysburg. He started the organization The Sons of Good Will in order to acquire land for black cemeteries. Biggs died on June 6, 1906 and is interred at the Lincoln Cemetery in Gettysburg. Playwright and actor Anna Deavere Smith is Biggs' great-great-granddaughter."

  "text" : "Bert Gilroy was an American film producer of the 1930s and 1940s. Born in Arizona in 1899, he began his Hollywood career behind the scenes on the 1926 silent film Pals in Paradise. In 1934, he began producing by overseeing short films for RKO Radio Pictures with Bandits and Ballads, a musical short. After four years of producing shorts, he would be given a chance at producing a full-length feature at RKO, with the western film, Gun Law. Later that year he would produce Painted Desert, a remake of the 1931 film The Painted Desert for which he was the assistant director, and was memorable as containing the first speaking role for Clark Gable. During the decade he was active, he would produce over 150 short and feature films. His feature films would overwhelmingly consist of westerns, many of which would star RKO's leading western star of the 1930s, Tim Holt. Gilroy spent almost his entire career at RKO studios, after its creation in 1929. His last credited film on which he was an associate producer on in 1946, Hollywood Bound was a compilation of three 1930s Betty Grable RKO short subjectsthat was released by Astor Pictures."

  "text" : "Boris Alexandrovitch Chetkov (Russian: Борис Александрович Четков; 27 October 1926–6 September 2010) was a Russian painter and glass artist known for his vivid works which range across genres but can be loosely aligned with Expressionism, Abstract Expressionism and Figurative Expressionism. His theories on art and use of colour also align him broadly with Modernism and Kandinsky though in his painting he worked largely in isolation from his peers and remained disconnected from the international art community until the end of Communism. He was a member of the Saint Petersburg Union of Artists. Despite a difficult early life and an almost total lack of recognition from the art establishment of the Soviet Union, Chetkov was a hugely experimental painter until his death. He had an almost obsessive urge to create: for example in the early 1990s alone he painted more than 400 pieces. Both his paint and glass works are notable for their evocative, idiosyncratic and sophisticated use of colour, which built in intensity through three distinct periods of artistic development. Chetkov's work can be found in private collections around the world as well as in the Hermitage Museum and the State Russian Museum in St Petersburg. His was the opening exhibition for Russian Art Week in 2013."

  "text" : "Balwant Thakur was born on the Christmas Day of 1960 in small mountain village in Reasi district of the north Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, to Hari Saran Thakur, a locally known traditional art performer. Thakur graduated in Business Management and Economics from the Government M. A. M. college, University of Jammu and followed it with a graduation in law. He continued studies and secured a post graduate degree in Mass Communication. After the studies, he turned to research and, with the assistance of a National Senior Fellowship from the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, in 1990, he did three years of research on the heritage of performing arts of Jammu. He also won a Ford Foundation grant for his research work under the title, Search for a new Theatre language. Thakur showed his taste for theatre at an early age when he, along with six of his friends, formed a children's theatre group called Seven Stars. The group staged a few plays such as Sabhya Saanp and Kanyadaan. During his student days, he was also active at college level theatre activities as well as in Radio Kashmir, writing and presenting various items in their Yuva Vani service. Years later, in 1983, at the age of 23, he founded Natrang, to pursue a career in theatre. Natrang was said to be a success from inception, collecting a State Academy award for best production for his play, Chauraha. During the next three years, the group staged plays like Neeli Jheel, Nanhen Kandhey Nanhen Pair, Singhasan Khali Hai and Rang Nagri and winning the State Academy awards for four consecutive years from 1983 till 1986. By this time, Thakur's attention has been set on the traditional theatre of dogri. The first dogri play he staged, Bawa Jitto, was staged at the North Zone Theatre Festival at Kurukshetra, which earned the play a slot in the National Theatre Festival, New Delhi. The play fetched critical review ahd has been staged at many parts of India. A few years later, in 1990, he premiered his play, Mahabhoj, a stage adaptation of a popular novel of the same name by Manu Bhandari, which was an exploration to find new alternatives to the set theatrical patterns. The play was adjudged the best play for the year in the North Zone and was selected for the National Theatre Festival, 1990. Balwant Thakur's next attempt was at the Children's theatre, Mere Hisse Ki Dhoop Kahan Hai, which wasa UNESCO project. The reports say that the play was a success with over 50 stages in and out of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The play was made into a movie, later, and screened at the Asia- Pacific Film Festival at Bangkok. Thakur has written many plays such as Suno Eh Kahani, Aaj Ki Aurat, Is Gran Gi Surg Banai Lo, Anpaden Da Hall, Jalo Khala, Mere Bi Ehen Kish Khaab and Aag and children's plays, Aap Hamare Hain Kaun, and Bhag Beta Bhag. The plays brough Natrang nationwide fame and the group travelled in many parts of India like Chandigarh, Shimla, Delhi, Lucknow, Allahabad, Jodhpur, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Goa, and Bhubaneshwar. The rigours of managing a full-time job as the Secretary of the Jammu and Kashmir Academy of Art, Culture and Languages along with his commitment towards Natrang made him quit the job in 2003, and started to devote his time entirely to theatre."

Nail won four American Contract Bridge League national championships and placed second eleven times. He represented the United States twice in the Bermuda Bowl, finishing secondin 1963. He was inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 2001. The Nail Life Master Open Pairs event is named after him. Nail and Robert Stucker invented the Big Diamond bidding system and presented it in the 1965 book Revolution in Bridge. A major departure from Standard American bidding concepts of the day, it featured a weak notrump, an unbalanced big 1♦ opening and a 1♣ opening that was forcing but not necessarily strong."

  "text" : "Boyan Slat (born 27 July 1994) is a Dutch inventor, entrepreneur and aerospace engineering student who works on methods of cleaning plastic waste from the oceans. He designed a passive system for concentrating and catching plastic debris driven by ocean currents. This won a prize for Best Technical Design at Delft University of Technology and he has established a foundation — The Ocean Cleanup — to further develop and eventually implement the technology. Initially, there was little interest, because it would only clean 5% of the plastics in our oceans, but, since his TEDx talk, How the Oceans can Clean Themselves, went viral because of his revolutionary idea, he has attracted thousands of volunteers and $2M of funding for pilot installations. In November 2014, he won the Champions of the Earth award of the United Nations Environment Programme. “Taking care of the world's ocean garbage problem is one of the largest environmental challenges mankind faces today,” Slat stated in a blog post. “Not only will this first cleanup array contribute to cleaner waters and coasts but it simultaneously is an essential step towards our goal of cleaning up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This deployment will enable us to study the system's efficiency and durability over time.” He says, the system, which involves a static platform that passively corrals plastics as wind and ocean currents push debris through 2000-meter booms, will be the longest floating structure ever deployed in the ocean. The pilot program will be operational for at least two years in the proposed deployment location of Tsushima Island in Japan, where approximately one cubic meter of plastic pollution per person is washed up each year."

Parker, Henry Fuqua, and Oramel H. Simpson. Prior to his state House tenure, Teekell was a member of the Red River Parish School Board from then Ward 7. A native of rural Melder in Rapides Parish in Central Louisiana, Teekell was the sixth of ten children of Nehemiah Teekell (1818-1911) and the former Lenora E. Gill (1833-1904). He was first married to the former Nancy Elmira Coody (1869-1918), by whom he had four children. After Nancy's death he married the former Chloe Josephine McDonald, who was twenty-nine years his junior. In the 1930 United States Census, Teekell and his second wife and their two children, Milam Judson Teekell (1920-1966) and Ollie Jo Teekell, later Ollie Manasco (1922-2001), were living in Many in Sabine Parish. After Teekell's death, Josephine, known as \"Josie\", married a man named \"Hatfield\" and lived in Shreveport. Teekell's youngest son, Milam, a retired United States Army captain, was killed in an automobile accident in Shreveport at the age of forty-six. Teekell died in Red River Parish eight days after his 75th birthday. He is interred with other Teekell family members at the rural Hand Cemetery in Red River Parish."

  "text" : "Professor Brian K Owler is an Australian neurosurgeon who was elected as president of the Australian Medical Association in May 2014 — just after the release of a controversial budget by the Abbott Government which included elements that, if passed, would have introduced patient co-payments for general practice services and cut funding to public hospitals and Indigenous health programs. Owler has opposed the Abbott government's Medicare copayment. Closer to home, this budget also denied funding to establish the Australasian Shunt Registry which was developed by Owler in order to address the relatively high rate of device-related complications in the management of hydrocephalus. Owler holds the position of Clinical Professor of Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital at Westmead Clinical School (also known as Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children), University of Sydney. He operates on paediatric and adult conditions in several Sydney hospitals, including Westmead Hospital, Sydney Adventist Hospital and Macquarie University Hospital. Prof Owler is involved in several clinical studies including those on the topic of normal pressure hydrocephalus and deep brain stimulation surgery for the treatment of cerebral palsy. He has co-authored more than 40 academic papers. He has also written several opinion pieces for leading Australian papers and online media. Prof Owler is a driving force and the face of the NSW 'Don’t Rush' anti-speeding campaign, and has appeared on billboards and in television ads warning of the risks and damage associated with road accidents. This advocacy arose from discussions with the relevant state minister while Owler was president of the NSW branch of the Australian Medical Association. In 2015, The Medical Journal of Australia removed professor Stephen Leeder, formerly the journal's editor-in-chief after he criticised the decision to outsource production of the journal to the global publishing giant Elsevier. All but one of the AMJ's editorial advisory committee resigned following the decision to sack Leeder, and wrote to Owler asking him to review the decision. In May 2015 Owler criticised a Federal Government plan to assist Curtin University open a medical school for undergraduates, arguing that medical students struggle to find internships or specialist training places."
