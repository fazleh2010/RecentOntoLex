  "text" : "Colin Keith Gray is a Canadian actor, writer and film director. He played Frank Hardy on the TV show The Hardy Boys for thirteen episodes. He is known for directing the documentary film Freedom's Fury. Gray was born in the American city of Ann Arbor, Michigan before his family moved to the Canadian city of Ottawa. He played on the high school water polo (the sport of his future film Freedom's Fury) team for Lisgar Collegiate Institute. Gray also performed in various productions by the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society and at the Ottawa Little Theatre. After high school, he moved backed to the States and graduated with degrees in political science and French literature from the University of Michigan (UMich) during a time when his sister (Megan Raney Aarons) and mother moved to the United Kingdom. After graduating from UMich, Gray moved to New York City where he eventually earned a role in the Broadway production of Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story. In 1995, Gray returned to Canada to perform in a lead role (Frank Hardy) alongside Paul Popowich (playing Joe Hardy) in the Toronto production of The Hardy Boys, produced and syndicated by New Line Television a division of New Line Cinema. The characters were portrayed as in their early twenties, Frank working as a reporter and Joe still in college. The show was co-produced by Canadian broadcasting company Nelvana and was dubbed in French for airing in Quebec and France as well as in the United States. The show only lasted for one season of thirteen episodes due to poor ratings. After the show ended, Gray moved to Los Angeles and earned small roles in television shows such as Saved by the Bell: The New Class before switching to writing and directing and setting up WOLO Entertainment with a friend. His sister Megan joined him (branding their partnership as The Sibs) to write and direct Freedom's Fury, a 2006 feature documentary film about the clash between Hungary and the Soviet Union in 'Blood in the Water match', the water polo semifinal of the 1956 Summer Olympics during the Soviets' military reaction to the Hungarian Revolution. By working with his UMich alumni Lucy Liu, who was working on Kill Bill at the time, they were able to lure Quentin Tarantino on as co-executive producer with Liu in 2001. The Canadian premiere earned them congratulations in the House of Commons in a Private Member's Statement by Liberal MP Andrew Telegdi. In the year of the film's release, Gray and Aarons were granted Hungary's highest civilian honour, the Knight’s Cross Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary. They now manage GRAiNEY Productions which has undertaken projects such as: \n*  Game Day! College Football to the Max, an IMAX 3D film about college football with Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll serving as executive producer \n*  Redlight a documentary with Lucy Liu about child sex trafficking that features Nobel Peace Prize nominees Mu Sochua and Somaly Mam."

A prominent member of the Doranites aristocratic family from Trebizond, Constantine Doranites’ activity should be viewed within the context of the civil strife that disrupted the Empire of Trebizond in the 14th century. In 1340–41 Constantine took part in the civil war under the leadership of Sebastos Tzaniches the megas stratopedarch, who was opposed to Empress Irene Palaiologina, which ended with the defeat of the Megas Stratopedarch. His actions after this defeat are not clear until 1341/2 when he fled to Constantinople with Niketas Scholares and Gregory Meitzomates. There they recruited John Megas Komnenos to return to Trebizond, where he was crowned emperor in September 1342. In 1344, at the accession of Emperor Michael Megas Komnenos, he was granted the dignity of protovestiarios. In 1351 he was the kephalatikeuon (provincial governor) of the Limnia, and revolted against Alexios III Megas Komnenos without any success. He was the brother of Theodore Pileles Doranites, likewise a senior court official in Trebizond, and had a son, John, who received the court title of pinkernes in 1344."

  "text" : "Christian Pitre (born 31 October 1983) is an American actress. She is best known for her leading role as action girl Mary Death in the 2013 post-Apocalyptic film Bounty Killer opposite Matthew Marsden and Kristanna Loken. The Hollywood Reporter remarked that Pitre \"spectacularly fulfills her role’s physical and athletic demands\", although dismissed the film as \"utterly silly and derivative but also undeniably entertaining\". She is also known for her role as Kristen in Shannon Christian's 2004 drama film Playing Clandestine, her screen debut, a role which she won after meeting an actor who knew the director in Nashville. In 2011 she featured as a waitress in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's romantic drama Crazy, Stupid, Love, opposite Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling. In 2009 she appeared in an episode of CSI: Miami, and in 2013 appeared as Claire in two episodes of the comedy series Adopted. In 2014 Pitre played the character of Victoria in an episode of True Blood."

  "text" : "C.J. Obasi (also known as \"Fiery\") was born and raised in small town, Owerri, Nigeria. C.J. grew up watching Hammer House of Horror films and reading Stephen King novels. As a child, he developed a knack for drawing and selling comics based on all his favourite movies and superheroes at the time. Much later on in life, C.J. would put aside his degree in Computer Science from the University of Nigeria (UNN) to launch into film making, full-time. C.J., called “Fiery” or “The Fiery One” by many within and without the industry, has worked on short films, documentaries, TV series and music videos as director, writer, cinematographer and editor. Jim & Joan, his debut feature, was shot in his childhood home in Owerri, as well as some choice beach spots on Lagos Island. Jim & Joan, an art house surrealistic piece, was made without a formal budget, with financial backing from C.J’s friend and partner, Benjamin Stockton. Jim & Joan was screened as the Closing Film at the Eko International Film Festival in November 2012, where it was noted as “the most daring film” in the festival, and C.J’s work was compared to the Danish auteur, Lars von Trier’s expressionism. C.J. set up his company “Fiery Film” in 2012. Soon after, his friend Benjamin Stockton, a screenwriter and movie aficionado from California came on board to help run the company. The no-budget horror thriller feature film “Ojuju”, written, directed and edited by C.J. premiered at AFRIFF where it won the award for Best Nigerian movie. C.J. won the Trailblazer award at the 2015 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards in March. C.J. is currently working on “O-Town”, a crime thriller epic piece, which C.J. calls his “Western in an Eastern land” and describes as “His exploration into genre-film making”. O-Town won the Restless Pitch at the Africa International Film Festival. C.J. has also worked as an editor on productions and on commercials for brands, including Globacom. He has cited Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Terrence Malick, Sam Raimi, Lars von Trier as influences."

  "text" : "Christina Ramberg (1946–1995) was an American painter associated with the Chicago Imagists, a group of representational artists—such as Jim Nutt, Gladys Nilsson, Roger Brown, and Ed Paschke—who attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the late 1960s. \"Taking cues from Surrealism, Pop, and West Coast underground comic illustration, Imagism at its heyday was enchanted with the abject status of sex in post-war America, particularly as writ on the female form.\" Ramberg was born in Kentucky in 1946 and died in Chicago in 1995 at the age of 49. Ramberg is best known for her depictions of partial female bodies (heads, torsos, hands) forced into submission by undergarments and imagined in odd, erotic predicaments. The motif of the female torso is most common; it is corseted, girdled, and otherwise constricted and veiled by the bondage-like accoutrements of typical 1950s female garments. Ramberg relates a memory of watching her mother dress for a party in an interview: \"She would wear these—I guess that they are called 'Merry Widow[s]'—and I can remember being stunned by how it transformed her body, how it pushed up her breasts and slenderized down her waist. I think that the paintings have a lot to do with this, with watching and realizing that a lot of these undergarments totally transform a woman's body. … I thought it was fascinating … in some ways, I thought it was awful.\" The motif of the \"hairdo\" is likewise common in Ramberg's oeuvre, the hairstyle also being indicative of a type of midcentury female \"conditioning\" or conformity. Critic Katheryn Rosenfeld, in a 2000 New Art Examiner review states: \"it's... hard not to read in the work a psychosexual inventory of the limitations of white middle-class womanhood at mid-century.\" Indeed, Ramberg has been characterized as being the Chicago Imagist equivalent of Lee Krasner to the Jackson Pollock male artists of the movement (such ad Ed Paschke and Jim Nutt) who frequently receive the lion's share of the art movement's attention (Ramberg was also married to Philip Hanson, a lesser-known member). In keeping with their subject matter, Christina Ramberg's paintings are highly composed and finished to the point that they themselves are referred to as fetishistic. Worked on masonite in acrylic, they are precisely painted and are characterized by their low tone and mute palette. In a 2012 Art in America review by Nancy Princenthal, she describes the draftsmanship in Ramberg's 1970 Corset/Urn series this way: \"inky black with spiky pink highlights, they are prim and sexily sinister... deft, dark and reticent.\" In the 1970s, Ramberg's work evolved from its strict focus on the female form to less sexualized, even non-human forms such as urn forms, chair backs, and geometries \"eliding the boundaries between figuration and abstraction, human and object.\" Still, her signature style remained: crisp, black outlines, muted colors, cropped forms, attention to pattern and detail. Ramberg was not exhibited extensively during her lifetime and is gaining notoriety in the contemporary art world with gallery representation at Corbett vs. Dempsey, Chicago, IL and solo shows in 2011 at David Nolan Gallery, NYC and in 2014 at The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, MA."

He created small photoengraving machines that could be used by small town newspapers to print photographs and patented several of these photo engraving machines. Martz quickly realized in order to sell his machines to newspapers, he would need trained photographers to help create the demand. Martz trained photographers at Tasopé for the new field of \"camera reporting.\" His students included Clifton C. Edom who has been called the \"Father of Photo Journalism.\"Martz also designed and built Tasopé cameras. Martz's work has been published in major photography journals of the period and his photographs and paintings were exhibited in New York City, Washington, DC, Chicago and St. Louis. He also judged photographic salons. In November 1944 the Smithsonian Institution Department of Engineering and Industries curated a special exhibit of 50 of Martz's \"pictorial photographs.\" Martz was a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society (FRPS), the Society's highest level of distinction.  He was also an Associate of the Photographic Society of America. In 1941, the Society of Ozark Photographers recognized Martz' contributions to the field of photography."

  "text" : "Alfred Cecil Harwood *05.01.1898 London (UK) †22.12.1975 Forest Row Sussex was a lecturer, Waldorf teacher, writer, editor and anthroposophist. Cecil Harwood was the youngest of five children born into the household of a pastor. He attended school together with Owen Barfield, who became his life-long friend and co-worker in many areas of his life. Together they studied at Oxford University and were part of the circle of the Inklings that included C.S. Lewis and J.R.R Tolkien. His friendship with Daphne Olivier, who later became his wife, led him to meet Rudolf Steiner and subsequently, to found the first Waldorf school in England, the so-called “New School” that later became Michael Hall, together with her and three other colleagues. He remained connected to the school for the rest his life. Daphne and he had had five children and worked together for over 25 years when she died in 1950. In the meantime, in 1948, a Swedish/English eurythmist by the name of Marguerite Lundgren had begun working in England, who was dedicated to English-language eurythmy and had become friends with both Owen Barfield and the Harwoods. She and Harwood married in 1953, beginning another fruitful co-work as they built up the eurythmy work in England with performances, international tours, the London School of Eurythmy and finally the book on which they collaborated with Marjorie Raffé, Eurythmy and the Impulse of Dance. Harwood had joined the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain shortly after meeting Rudolf Steiner for the first time in 1924. In 1937 he became its chairman and General Secretary, a position he carried until 1974. In this capacity he was instrumental not just in developing the work in the United Kingdom but also in re-establishing the international relationships within the Anthroposophical Society as a whole after the internal difficulties of the 1930s and 1940s. This implied a certain amount of travel, which he undertook not just on behalf of the Society but also in assisting the growth and development of Waldorf education worldwide and in particular, in the United States. He was founder and for many years editor of Child and Man, the journal of the Waldorf Steiner schools in Great Britain, as well as writing one of the definitive works on Waldorf Education for the English-speaking world: The Recovery of Man in Childhood. Besides this, he translated into English certain central works of Anthroposophical life from Rudolf Steiner’s original formulations. These were the Calendar of the Soul, a cycle of meditations through the changing seasons of the year; the Services of The Christian Community and the three texts of the Oberuferer Weihenachtsspiele, traditional Christmas plays from the village of Oberufer in today’s Slovakia. His friendship with Owen Barfield and C.S. Lewis has been well-recorded in the biographies written on these two personalities. It seems to have been a fruitful relationship throughout, influencing the work and thought of all three. He went mysteriously blind in the course of holding a lecture in 1975 and died not long after in South Harbour, the house he and Marguerite had shared in Forest Row."

Many of his plant collections were sent to herbaria in Geneva and Paris. He was the taxonomic authority of numerous botanical taxa.

  "text" : "Conrad Antonio Maduro is a veteran politician in the British Virgin Islands and longtime leader of the United Party. Remarkably, Conrad Maduro has led his party to victory at three different general elections, but has never been appointed Chief Minister. \n*  In the 1967 general election, Maduro as President led the United Party to victory, but lost his individual seat to Isaac Glanville Fonseca. As he was not elected, Lavity Stoutt was appointed Chief Minister in his stead. \n*  In the 1971 general election, Maduro won his seat, but the United Party lost power. \n*  In the 1975 general election, the United Party once again won the general election, but Maduro lost his seat. However, as the party formed a coalition with Willard Wheatley, the incumbent Chief Minister, it is highly unlikely Maduro would have been appointed Chief Minister even if he had won. \n*  In the 1983 general election, the United Party won the general election, and Maduro won his seat. However, the party again needed to form a coalition, and formed it with Cyril Romney with Cyril Romney becoming Chief Minister. Maduro has contested more general elections in the British Virgin Islands than any other politician except for Lavity Stoutt and Ralph T. O'Neal, contesting ten general elections between (and including) the 1967 general election and the 2003 general election, winning four times. Including by-elections, Conrad Maduro has contested 11 elections in total; equaling the record held jointly by Lavity Stoutt and Ralph O'Neal. Whereas politics in the British Virgin Islands is normally characterised by leading politicians crossing the floor, during his political career Maduro was unusual in remaining steadfastly loyal to the United Party. After the 1983 general election, he formed part of the coalition government and served as Minister for Natural Resurces and Public Health. He also performed the same Ministerial role as an opposition politician between 1972 and 1975 when Dr Q.W. Osborne was removed from his ministerial post in 1972. In 1986, he won election in the 2nd District over Prince Stoutt by just a single vote, which is tied for the record for the narrowest margin of victory in a British Virgin Islands election. His victory with just 92 votes is also a record for the smallest number of votes for a victorious candidate. From 1988 to 1990, he served as the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council of the British Virgin Islands."

  "text" : "Charles Rodrigues (September 29, 1926 - June 14, 2004) was an American cartoonist perhaps best known as a contributor to National Lampoon. Rodrigues was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts; his father came from Madeira, Portugal and his mother was a local woman of Portuguese descent. After a stint in the U.S. Navy, he read in Writer's Digest that a magazine entitled Country Gentleman was paying forty dollars for cartoons - then a large sum of money - and determined to become a cartoonist. With support from the G.I. Bill, he went to New York City to attend the Cartoonist and Illustrators School (now the School of Visual Arts). He began peddling his cartoons around 1950, selling at first to low-grade girlie magazines, then to Playboy, to which he would contribute continually for many years. From the 1950s onward he worked for many magazines of many different kinds, including Esquire, TV Guide, a Catholic publication called The Critic, and Paul Krassner's The Realist. He began contributing to the National Lampoon as of its first issue in April 1970, and continued to do so until 1993. Although his politics differed sharply from those of the Lampoon's staff, the magazine provided a wide outlet for his sense of humor. Art director Michael Gross had this to say about him: Y'know when I mentioned before that Liberals have no sense of humor? Actually, the only people who have less are the religious Right. Now, look at Charles Rodrigues. Almost nobody is as tasteless as Rodrigues can be. The man would deliver stuff that we would just cringe at. His first piece was the atrocious - and hilarious - \"Hire the Handicapped\".... In later years, I found out that he's a conservative, fairly religious, Portuguese artist who really thought we were awful people. [laughter] He hated our politics, but he was able to transcend that... so I could never figure out what his attitude was. In a collection of interviews with various cartoonists, Mark Jacobs wrote: He works at night, which is fitting, since some of his best cartoons deal with the dark side of the psyche. A classic black humorist, he rummages around in violence, insanity, perversion, bigotry and scatology, looking for what he needs to create the typical Rodrigues effect: wild laughter with a cringe of repulsion. He was also a long-time contributor to Stereo Review, beginning with its first issue in 1958, and created three comic features for the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate: Eggs Benedict, Casey the Cop and the daily panel Charlie. Charles Rodrigues died on June 14, 2004 at the age of 77. He was survived by his wife Lorraine and daughters Judith and Ann. Two collections of Rodrigues's work were published during his lifetime: Spitting on the Sheriff and Other Diversions (Fawcett Gold Medal, 1966), which consists of cartoons from various men's magazines, and Total Harmonic Distortion (Perfectbound Press, 1988), which reprints his work from Stereo Review. He also drew cartoons for Defending the Undefendable (Fleet Press, 1976), a discourse by libertarian economist Walter Block. In 2013, Fantagraphics Books published Ray and Joe: The Story of a Dead Man and His Friend, and Other Classic Comics, a collection of his pages from National Lampoon. In late 2015, Fantagraphics published a second collection, Gag on This: The Scrofulous Cartoons of Charles Rodrigues, which collects gag cartoons from the Lampoon."

It was in this context, in 2014, that she discovered a photo of a model on Target Corporation's website with a photoshopped thigh gap and wrote critically about its health implications on her blog. Target subsequently apologized for altering the photo. In April 2015, Ho responded to negative comments about her body by creating a YouTube video called The \"Perfect\" Body."

Several hundred thousand dollars in capital was raised during that time period for construction and modernization on the Gold Coast (British colony) through the stock market, and infrastructure metal deals were made with companies such as U.S. Steel. In the beginning of Chappelle's business, he was reported to have made contracts with 82 tribal chiefs in Gold Coast, West Africa, for the exportation of gold, cocoa, rubber, and mahogany. The money was to be used to develop 440 miles with the African Central Railroad and the West Coast Steam and Harbor Company, both African-American and African joint ventures."

He is well known for his landscapes and expressionist abstracts. Hall had a successful exhibition of large abstracts at the Peppers Bluewater Resort in Tekapo in 2012. Caley is the artist formerly known as DJ Biggles, having worked in the club scene for many years. He also got himself in the news throughout Australasia in 1999 for giving then New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley a few \"cheeky\" kisses during a visit to the Earnslaw.  Hall has written a book, “Jackson and the Plum Tree”, about his Highland cow Maggie and his Kunekune Jackson. He has been featured in the New Zealand media numerous times, particularly for the generous support he has given to schools in the region both raising funds and introducing the pupils to landscape art.   Caley was also been in the January / February 2016 edition of The New Zealand Artist for his distinctive landscape style."

He was a former educator, having served as Superintendent of Sullivan County Schools from 1948 to 1971, and as Field Representative for the Tennessee Board of Education from 1971 to 1979. He was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1981 as a Democrat, representing the 1st district, encompassing Sullivan County. He did not run for reelection upon the expiration of his term, stating, \"to be perfectly honest, I don't believe I can be an effective legislator because the role is not in keeping with my background and temperament\". He graduated from Emory & Henry College in 1938, where he played baseball and basketball. He later played professional baseball for the Johnson City Soldiers, Bristol Twins, Kingsport Cherokees and Newport Canners of the Appalachian League, with his career lasting from 1938 to 1945. He and his wife Margaret had two children. He died in 2015."

Aaron made his last pefomance at the 2015 Red Bull Air Race World Championship in Las Vegas. Aaron is also an experienced test pilot, having test-flown a tracking system for the Boeing AH-64 Apache; and an infrared vision system as the first helicopter pilot to deliberately fly into brownout conditions. He is also an FAA certificated Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic, and has assembled three working TAH-1F Cobras from surplus parts. Aaron performs aerobatic maneuvers—loop, roll, vertical climb, Split S, Cuban Eight, Immelman, and “Chuckcevak” (modified Lomcovak)—at air shows and other demonstrations in an MBB Bo 105, with proprietary modifications invented by Aaron, that allow it to perform maneuvers previously impossible for helicopters. This was featured in the opening sequence of the James Bond film Spectre. He serves as Chief Pilot and Director of A&P Maintenance for the “Red Bull Air Force”. One of Aaron's TAH-1F Cobras is flown on the European air show circuit, by “The Flying Bulls”."

  "text" : "Carl G. Zimmerman (c. 1918 – April 11, 2014) was an American television journalist, news anchor and World War II war correspondent. Zimmermann had the longest on-air broadcasting career in the history of the Milwaukee media market, having spent more than 50 years on television and radio in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. He spent much of his television career at WITI (Channel 6). Zimmermann joined WITI in 1959 (after a stint as an anchorman at WTVW (now WISN)) as a television reporter at the station. In 1973 he began doing investigation reports under the consumer action series \"Contact 6\", in which he helped viewers who wrote or called in to the station to ask him about checking out various subjects from contract disputes to fraudulent practices (that the viewers became a victim of). Zimmermann continued to do \"Contact 6\" reports until he retired in 1986 as WITI's director of communications; Tom Hooper succeeded him and continued \"Contact 6\" until his own retirement, followed by Katrina Cravy, who does the segment currently. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called him the \"dean of broadcast news in Milwaukee.\" Zimmermann was born in Milwaukee to German immigrant parents. He graduated from South Division High School in 1937. He had already begun his broadcasting career in high school when he took a part-time job at WEMP, which led to a full-time position with the radio station. Zimmermann enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942 during World War II. Due to his broadcasting experience, Zimmermann became a U.S. Army combat war correspondent. Zimmermann became a regular correspondent on NBC's \"Army Hour\", filing reports from North Africa, Sicily, Italy (including the liberation of Rome), France and Germany during the war. He regularly worked with Eric Sevareid and Edward R. Murrow as colleagues. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his reports in 1944. Zimmermann also met Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemmingway at a Parisian bar. Carl Zimmermann died from pneumonia and heart disease at Milwaukee Catholic Home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on April 11, 2014, at the age of 96. He was survived by his wife, the former Doris Ann Loftis, whom he married in 1942, and four children: Scott Zimmermann, Richard Zimmermann, Mary Beth Nichols and Susan Klein."

  "text" : "Constant Lavaux (1877–1961), stage name Constant le Boucher (\"Constant the Butcher\"), was a Belgian wrestler during the sport's Golden Age of 1890–1914. He was born as a farmer's son in Florennes, Namur province. He took up the trade of butcher at the age of 17, hence his stage name \"the Butcher\".He came to Paris in 1897 and began to practice wrestling in his free time, eventually joining the gym of famous French wrestler Paul Pons and began his professional career, becoming Pons' master student. At this time, the creation of modern sport wrestling, known as Greco-Roman wrestling, led to a surge of popularity of the sport throughout Europe, and especially in Paris, which reached its height in the years leading up to World War I. Constant Lavaux became one of the popular heroes of the sport, and one of the most famous athletes in Europe during this period.Lavaux came second in the wrestling world championships of both 1900 and 1901 He became famous for his (losing) match with George Hackenschmidt on 19 December in the 1901 tournament, and for his close and gruelling rematch with Hackenschmidt (in which he was howerver also defeated) on 27 December."

Constantine was born sometime after 1358 into the family of Bagrat I, then duke (and ex-king) of Imereti, and his wife, a Jaqeli noblewoman of Samtskhe. He was a younger brother of two successive kings of Imereti, Alexander I and George I, who had broken away from the Kingdom of Georgia during Timur's invasions of that country. After the death of George I in the battle with Vameq I Dadiani, Duke of Mingrelia, in 1392, Constantine and his nephew, Demetrius, son of Alexander, fled to the Caucasian mountains, while Imereti was reintegrated by George VII of Georgia. In 1396, Constantine took advantage of George VII's continuous war with Timur—in which a great number of Imeretians died—and the death of Vameq Dadiani and returned to Imereti. He conquered a number of fortresses in the country and proclaimed himself king. Subsequently, he attempted to win over the dukes of Mingrelia and Guria, and the Svans, but he was killed in 1401. As Constantine was childless, the crown of Imereti was to be passed on to his young and weak nephew, Demetrius, but Imereti was reconquered by George VII of Georgia."

She is the daughter of the late fashion designer and artist Mili Arango and Richard Cappalli, the retired law professor and author. Cappalli was a professional model most of her life and studied acting and photography at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Rome, Italy. From 1998 through 2003 she worked as Executive Director and later as Public Relations Consultant for the Humane Society of Puerto Rico. There she promoted the proper care of pets and also their adoption and spay/neutering. In 2003 Cappalli founded and presided over the Puerto Rico branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. With the SPCA of PR, Cappalli worked on animal cruelty cases such as the confiscation and relocation of seven polar bears being kept in inhumane conditions by a Mexican traveling circus. She has also filed a lawsuit against one of Puerto Rico’s biggest chicken factory farms, Empresas Pollos Picú. Undercover videos revealed company employees beating chickens to death with bats. In December 2005 she chained herself to a circus fence to protest the misuse of animals by Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey. Throughout the years Cappalli has been prominent in the media as spokesperson for animal welfare in Puerto Rico. In October 2003 Cappalli was recognized by The Civic Club of Ladies as one of the most distinguished women in Island society. On December 2007, Cappalli was once again honored, this time by the publication Revista Imagen which named her “Lady of Image and Exemplary Life” for her philanthropic and humanitarian efforts.Presently, Cappalli dedicates herself to the growth of her businesses Urban Pet by Carla Cappalli. She regularly designs collections and distributes them to some of the island’s finest pet shops. A percentage of the sales of Urban Pet is donated to help animal welfare in Puerto Rico. As part of her efforts to promote animal welfare education in Puerto Rico, Cappalli has written and published a bi-lingual coloring book entitled “The Golden Rules for Helping Animals.” The book will be donated to public schools throughout Puerto Rico."

  "text" : "(Caroline) Mary Ridding (30 August 1862 – 9 November 1941) was a scholar of Sanskrit and Pali, and a librarian. She is known for translating Banabhatta's Kadambari into English in 1896. She was born in Meriden, West Midlands (then in Warwickshire). Her father, William Ridding (1830-1900), was the vicar of Meriden and also played cricket, and her mother was Caroline Selina Caldecott. She was also close to Lady Laura (Palmer) Ridding, the wife of her uncle George Ridding. She won a scholarship to read Classics at Girton College in 1883 and was there until 1886. After this, she financed her further studies by taking up tutoring, including a job as a classics tutor in London. She was one of the first (and possibly the first) English woman Sanskrit scholars, and published a translation of Bāṇabhaṭṭa's portion of the Kādambarī in 1896. She was a student of E. B. Cowell and, following his death in 1903, was instrumental in getting about 260 books of his as an acquisition (\"Cowell Library\") into the Girton College Library in 1904. She catalogued these books herself, and was the first woman to be officially employed in the Cambridge University Library, going on to catalogue many important collections. In 1923, when Cambridge University began to allow women to receive titular degrees, she got her Master of Arts degree. Apart from being a scholar in Sanskrit in Pali, she also knew a bit of Bengali and Hindi. In later life she was particularly interested in Tibet, and was a reviewer for Tibetan books in the Journal of Asiatic Studies. She was an admirer of Charlotte Mary Yonge, and presented her collection of Yonge's work to Girton College before and at her death. The Ridding Reading Prize competition at Girton College was founded in her honour."

  "text" : "Charles Ray Anding (July 15, 1928 – May 20, 2004) of West Monroe, Louisiana, was a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from District 15 in Ouachita Parish. He served two terms from 1988 to 1996. Anding was a son of John Anding (1901–1981) and Mellie B. Anding (1903–1995) of West Monroe. From 1945, shortly after his marriage at the age of seventeen to the former Lillie Lorece Parnell, Anding became an officer of the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers. He held several positions with the union until his retirement in 1992. Prior to his state House service, he had been a member of the Ouachita Parish School Board and for two terms between 1966 and 1974 an alderman on the West Monroe City Council, having served his city during the administration of Mayor Bert Hatten. In the 1987 general election, Anding narrowly defeated the Republican David Glen Haynes (born c. 1954) to claim the seat vacated by Democrat Evelyn Blackmon, the first woman elected to the legislature from Ouachita Parish. Blackmon ran third in the nonpartisan blanket primary and was hence eliminated from the second round of balloting. Anding prevailed by 201 votes, 5,672 (50.9 percent) to Haynes's 5,471 (49.1 percent). No Republican challenged Anding in 1991, and he received 81 percent of the vote to secure his second term. In 1995, however, he was toppled by the Republican Mike Walsworth, since a member of the Louisiana State Senate. Walsworth received 7,745 votes (54.7 percent) to Anding's 6,403 (45.3 percent). The Andings had three children, Anita Anding, Shirley A. Downs, and Earnest Anding. He died at the age of seventy-five and is interred in West Monroe at Luna Methodist Cemetery."

  "text" : "Carel Peeters (born 5 June 1944, Nijmegen) is one of the leading Dutch literary critics and since 1973 a writer and editor at Vrij Nederland. Peeters grew up in Nijmegen but moved, with his parents, to Amsterdam at age 14. In 1964 he enrolled at the University of Amsterdam to study literature, and began writing for the newspaper Het Parool; he never attained his degree. In 1970 he was hired by Elsevier, where he worked as the assistant of Wim Zaal, and in 1973 moved to Vrij Nederland (where he still works) and started their literary supplement, which in 1982 earned him an award from the Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek, the Dutch trade organization for booksellers and publishers. From 1987 to 1992 he was a professor of literature at the University of Amsterdam. Peeters published more than a dozen collections of essays, and was awarded the Dr. Wijnaendts Francken award for essays and literary criticism in 1985, and in 2008 the Jacobson Award, awarded to \"elderly\" literati. As a literary critic, Peeters, whose allegiance is with the writers and critics associated with Forum from the 1930s and the De Revisor from the 1980s, is well known as an opponent of postmodernism; he published a pamphlet on the subject in 1986 and the following year participated in a well-publicized public debate with Christel van Boheemen."

  "text" : "Charupong Ruangsuwan (Thai: จารุพงศ์ เรืองสุวรรณ, rtgs: Charuphong Rueangsuwan, first name also transcribed as 'Jarupong'; born 15 August 1946) is a Thai civil servant and politician. Since October 2012 he has been the chairman of the Pheu Thai Party. From January to October 2012, he was the Minister of Transport and Communication, from October 2012 until the military coup d'état in May 2014 the Minister of Interior of Thailand. Charupong's father was the politician Charubut Ruangsuwan, who served as President of the National Assembly in the 1980s and Member of Parliament representing Khon Kaen Province for six terms (he was also a Seri Thai fighter during World War II, and a scholar of Isan, i.e. Northeastern Thai, culture). Charupong has graduated from Amnuay Silpa School, and holds a Bachelor of Law from Thammasat University and a Master of Public Administration from Chulalongkorn University. Moreover, he completed a course at the National Defence College of Thailand. He became an officer of the Department of Provincial Administration, serving as Chief district officer of several districts (amphoe) in Northeastern and Central Thailand. He later changed to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), successively serving as director of Bang Khen district, deputy director of the cleansing department, assistant to the permanent secretary for the BMA, director of the community development department, director of the education department, and deputy permanent secretary for the BMA. In 2002, he returned to the state administration, successively serving as deputy permanent secretary in the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Labour, and permanent secretary in the Ministry of Justice. Coevally, he was the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bangkok Mass Transit Authority starting from 2003. From 2006 to 2010, he was the rector of Southeast Asia University. Charupong was a member of the People's Power Party, and after its dissolution by the Constitutional Court in 2008 became a member of Pheu Thai Party. In May 2011, the party chose him as Secretary-General. Two months later, Pheu Thai won the general election. After Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's first cabinet reshuffle, Charupong was appointed Minister of Transport and Communication. When Pheu Thai Party chairman and Minister of Interior Yongyuth Wichaidit had to resign over a corruption scandal in September 2012, Charupong succeeded him in both positions. The government, that acted only in caretaker capacity after dissolving the House of Representatives in December 2013, was toppled by a military coup on 22 May 2014. The junta ordered all cabinet members to report to their headquarters, but unlike other politicians Charupong refused to turn himself in. He claims to have taken shelter at an unspecified place in Northeastern Thailand. As a consequence, the National Council for Peace and Order blocked his bank accounts and assets. On 24 June 2014, Charupong announced the formation of the Organisation of Free Thais for Human Rights and Democracy (OFHD), seeking to restore Thai popular sovereignty in the face of the 2014 Thai coup d'état. The date chosen is the 82nd anniversary of the Siamese Revolution of 1932. The organisation's name recalls the Thai underground resistance movement against Imperial Japan during World War II known as the Free Thai Movement (Thai: เสรีไทย, Seri Thai). On 24 June 2015, Charupong, acting as Secretary-General of OFHD, in a video uploaded on YouTube warned Thais of the risk Thailand turning into a failed state and detailed three goals of OFHD: (1) abolition of the Privy Council, (2) depoliticization/democratization/normalization of the Thai Army, and (3) depoliticization of the Thai judiciary."

He was the vice-presidential nominee of the Liberty Party in 1848 alongside Gerritt Smith. The Liberty Party was an abolitionist political party which later merged with the Free Soil Party. Foote was one of five children of Dr. Henry K. Foote and Minerva Henderson. Foote was born in 1811 in Olean, New York and moved to Milford, Michigan in 1834. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1840. He was ordained a Presbyterian minister and married Clarissa Clark in that same year. He spent the next two years studying medicine at Fairfield Medical School with a desire for foreign missionary work. Instead of going abroad, Foote served as a pastor in churches in upstate New York and Michigan. In 1848, he was chosen as the Liberty Party's vice-presidential nominee on the 2nd ballot of their national convention. In 1854, Foote moved to Detroit, Michigan and served as a traveling fundraising agent of the Refugee Home Society, which purchased land for former slaves in Ontario, where slavery was outlawed. He stayed in this position until the American Civil War ended and slavery was outlawed, at which time Foote became an agent in the Freedmen's Aid Society. In 1882, Foote ran for Governor of Michigan as the American Party nominee. The American Party was a political party which demanded recognition of the Sabbath, the introduction of the Bible into public schools, alcohol prohibition, the restriction of land monopolies and resumption of specie payment. He was also an active member of the Prohibition Party from its founding in 1869 until his death in 1891. Foote's first wife, Clarissa, died in 1857 and was buried in White Lake, Michigan. He married Hannah Merritt a year later. Foote died on May 3, 1891 at the age of 80 and was also buried in White Lake."

Over the years he has written over a hundred poems, including many in sijo form. In 2007 he received the Cheong Chi-yong Literary Award for his book Distant Holy Man. He is Josil of Kibon Seonwon (Spiritual Master of Fundamental Seon Mediation Center) of Jogye Order of the Korean Buddhism at Baekdamsa Monastery and famous for his Poetry of Delusion. He founded Manhae Foundation and Manhae Prize in Korea. He started his Seon Poetry career in 1966. Soon in 1977, he became the abbot of Sinheungsa Temple which is the 3rd Diocese of Jogye Order of the Korean Buddhism. His Books of Seon Poetry, Ten Ox-Herding was published in 1978, The Seon Anthology of Manak Gathas was published in 2002, A Remote Holy Man was published in 2007. Many authors have written on Seorak Musan Cho Oh Hyun. He became Josil of Kibon Seonwon (Spiritual Master of Fundamental Seon Mediation Center) of Jogye Order of the Korean Buddhism at Baekdamsa Monastery on 14 March 2014. He is renowned not only in South Korea but also in European and Asian countries like Germany, India, Sri Lanka, etc. for his poetry. He is also a painter. Lee (2011) described the Wisdom of the Social Awakening emerged in the Gathas of Searching the Bulls : centering on Musan Cho Oh-Hyun’s Gathas of Ten Ox Herding. He further elaborate that Seorak Musan Cho Oh-Hyun wrote Musan's Ten Ox Herding gathas as the process of his practice through Seon poems. He concluded that ox-herding story of Seorak Musan Cho Oh Hyun leads people to peaceful shelter to stop agony and awake the reality of the world truly. Ox-herding practice can be an alternative for awakening society. Lee (2013) discussed Musan Cho Oh Hyun and Ethics Education. He revealed that Musan Cho Oh Hyun’s approach to ethics education is humanistic. His teachings import the carriage of leading a life worthy of a human being. While embodying the transcendental ethics of Seon Buddhism, Musan teaches that in order to lead a truly human life, it is paramount for all mortals to respect the collective rules of communities. In his exposition of the Buddhist ethics, Musan shows a supple understanding that goes beyond Sila and Vinaya, the rules of daily Buddhist lives."

When her triplet brothers, the findemna, were fighting with their father Eochu Feidlech for the high kingship, she was concerned that her brothers might die without heirs. She is said to have seduced the three of them, and conceived Lugaid Riab nDerg. The next day, according to legend, her brothers were indeed killed, and when Lugaid was born, he was their heir. His epithet Riab nDerg (\"the red-striped\") came from two red stripes around his neck and waist, dividing him into three: above the neck he resembled Nár; from the neck to the waist he resembled Bres; and from the waist down he resembled Lothar. Lugaid later also became a High King of Ireland, so that her incest preserved the line of succession. Incest features further in Clothru's story: she is said to have then slept with Lugaid herself, conceiving Crimthann Nia Náir, who later also became a High King of Ireland. She was thus both Crimthann's mother and his grandmother. Clothru is described as the sister of Medb and Ethne in the Metrical Dindsenchas"

  "text" : "Charles Bayliss (1850-4 June 1897), photographer, was born in Hadleigh, Suffolk, England in 1850. He went to Australia with his parents and they arrived in Melbourne in 1854. When about sixteen years old Bayliss met the travelling photographer, Beaufoy Merlin, who came to the Bayliss house in suburban Melbourne while photographing houses and families throughout Victoria, with a view to selling the photographs to people along the way. Merlin operated under the name of the American and Australasian Photographic Company (A & A Photographic Company). Bayliss became Merlin's assistant and the pair travelled extensively throughout Victoria and New South Wales. At the goldfields around Hill End, New South Wales, Merlin and Bayliss met Bernhardt Otto Holtermann, who had become wealthy as the result of successful gold mining. Holtermann employed the A & A Photographic Company to produce a series of photographs of the settled areas of Victoria and New South Wales, which could be sent abroad to advertise the colony and encourage migrants. By September 1873 the major part of New South Wales had been completed. However Merlin died at this time. Bayliss, then 23 years old, was contracted to continue the work on the project in both New South Wales and Victoria and, in 1874, Holtermann purchased a mammoth Plate camera for Bayliss and the first images taken with it were of Holtermann's recent purchase of the Post office Hotel in Sydney. Bayliss also completed a panorama of Ballarat using this camera. In 1875 a panorama of Sydney was completed. This was taken from the tower attached to Holtermann's house in North Sydney, now part of Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore). Bayliss was the main photographer, with work also done by Holtermann together with another photographer, Henshaw Clarke. Up to this time Bayliss was based in Melbourne. Then, in 1876, he and the family moved to Sydney and he established a studio in the city. In 1951 approximately 3,500 glass plate photographic negatives were found in the possession of Bernhardt Holtermann's descendants. They were subsequently donated to the Mitchell Library (within the NSW State Library) in Sydney and form the basis of the \"Holtermann Collection.\" In fact, Beaufoy Merlin and Charles Bayliss were the photographers. On 7 March 1953, Eric Bayliss, a son of Charles Bayliss, wrote a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald regarding his father's work. He quoted from an obituary for Bayliss, which appeared in the \"Australian Photographical Review\" on 19 June 1897, two weeks after the death of Bayliss: \"He also took the well-known panorama of Sydney and the harbour from the great dome of the Garden Palace in the Domain and, to get this, performed some astonishing and risky feats of climbing and balancing on the outside of the dome. The picture was taken on a series of 18in x 22in plates and, when completed, formed a panoramic view nearly 20ft in length...\" In the letter to the newspaper, Eric Bayliss himself then went on to note that: \"These, as well as all other work by him, were taken on 'wet plate' negatives. He took a vast number of photographs of Sydney, the suburbs, mountains, and country, as far as the Victorian border, as well as groups and portraits. After Beaufoy Merlin's death, Charles Bayliss took over the business and carried on in his own name until his death. Many of the photographs found in the shed on the property owned by Mr. Holtermann were taken by Charles Bayliss.\" In 1883 Bayliss had married Christiana Salier. They had seven children together: Raymond Charles (born 1884), Alfred John (1886), Charles (1887—died in infancy), Bessie Salier (1888), Emily Annie (1891), Walter Norman (1893), Eric Edward (1896). Alfred and Walter were both killed in France during World War One. On 4 June 1897 Charles Bayliss died at his home, \"Hadleigh\" in Wemyss Street, Marrickville, a suburb of Sydney. He had previously caught a chill which swiftly turned to a \"galloping pneumonia.\" He left a wife and young family, the oldest child being only 13 years old. The obituary in the \"Australian Photographical Review\" (mentioned above) noted that \"As a man he was ever genial and kindly; as a landscape photographer he had few equals and no superiors. His memory is forever honoured in the hearts of all who knew him.\" His memory is also forever honoured in the \"Holtermann Collection,\" the most important photographic documentation of goldfields life in Australia and an enduring record of life in Australia in the late 19th century."

  "text" : "Charles Cahill Wilson (July 29, 1894 – January 7, 1948) was an American character actor of the early sound film. The white-haired, burly actor was often typecast as an earnest police officer, newspaper editor or principal. He appeared in over 250 films between 1928 and 1948, mostly playing small supporting roles with a few sentences. Charles Wilson began his acting career at the theatre, including roles in six Broadway plays between 1918 and 1931. In 1928, he directed the Hollywood comedy Lucky Boy (1928), where he also made his film debut. According to the Internet Movie Database, Lucky Boy was Wilson's only film as a director. His most notable role was probably Clark Gable's \"wonderfully aggravated\" newspaper boss in Frank Capra's comedy It Happened One Night, which won five Academy Awards in 1935. He was also cast in small roles in other Capra movies such as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). Shortly before his death, Wilson appeared as the boss of the Three Stooges in the two-reel comedy Crime on Their Hands (1948). He died at the age of 53 of esophageal varices."

He is next recorded as being active in 1190/1, during the Byzantine efforts to suppress the Bulgarian–Vlach rebellion of the brothers Peter and Ivan Asen. The historian Niketas Choniates records that, in an effort to sustain the troops and bolster their morale, Aspietes decided to distribute to them their delayed annual salaries. This act, however, enraged Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who saw in it nothing short of an attempt to bribe the army to support Aspietes in overthrowing him. The emperor had Aspietes arrested and blinded, after which nothing further is known of him. He possibly died in the early years of the 13th century."

  "text" : "Cornelius Hill (November 13, 1834 – January 25, 1907) or Onangwatgo (“Big Medicine”) was the last hereditary chief of the Oneida Nation, and fought to preserve his people's lands and rights under various treaties with the United States government. A lifelong Episcopalian, he was ordained a priest of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America at age 69, and ministered to his people until shortly before his death. The Oneida, one of the five founding tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy, had aligned with the Americans during the American Revolutionary War, but when faced with pressure from white settlers who often mistook them for members of hostile tribes, had begun negotiating with the Ho-Chunk and Menominee tribes and moving to Wisconsin around 1821. Many members had become Christians under missionaries sent by the Episcopal and Methodist Churches to both New York and Wisconsin. In 1825, tribal members built a log church near the Fox River and an important portage on their new lands about 10 miles southwest of Green Bay, Wisconsin, which they called the Hobart Chapel after its consecrating bishop, John Henry Hobart of New York."

  "text" : "Christine Noonan (born Christine Elizabeth Wright; 8 March 1945 – 6 August 2003) was a British actress. She is best known for her role as the anarchist and love interest of Malcolm McDowell in the 1968 film if..... In one scene, which gained particular notoriety in British cinema of the period, she impersonated a tiger and had sexual intercourse with McDowell's character Mick Travis on the floor of a cafe, which with the later violence in the film led to an X rating, leading Paramount to later cut the sexual content from the film. Noonan has said of the infamous scene in the film: \"He was stark naked and I was stark naked, but we were both so busy fighting that I can't remember what he looked like in the nude\". Her husband initially protested when he learned of the nature of the role, but he agreed to her acting in it once she explained the point of the film and the context. Noonan also appeared opposite McDowell, although with a more minor role as a girl at a stag party, in the 1973 film O Lucky Man!, and also appeared in the films Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), Malatesta (1970) and Backwoods (1987). She found work on the stage in the 1970s, performing in George Etheridge's comedy \"She Would If She Could\" for the Nuffield Theatre Company at Lancaster University in 1972. Noonan played the role of Barberina in the TV serial Casanova, and her last role was as a business woman in the series Babylon 5 in 1997. She was often out of work as an actress and worked selling wool in an Army and Navy store. She was married to Denis Noonan, and later to Lawrence Dennett, with whom she had 3 children. She died in 2003 at age 58, of cancer."

  "text" : "Clark C. Gibson (born June 23, 1961 in Fontana California) is an American political scientist, best known for his work on African politics, elections in emerging democracies, and environmental politics. Gibson is currently a professor at the University of California, San Diego, where he previously served as chairman of the Department of Political Science. He has consulted for The World Bank, The United Nations, the Carter Center, the United States Agency for International Development, the National Democratic Institute, and the International Republican Institute. Gibson has done influential work on electoral fraud. Gibson graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Notre Dame, then joined the Peace Corps, serving in Nepal. Gibson left Nepal for medical reasons, subsequently working as a paralegal and high school teacher before beginning graduate study in political science at Duke University. While working on his doctoral dissertation, Gibson conducted field work in Zambia, Africa where he studied wildlife politics and poaching in national parks. While in Zambia, Gibson encountered a group of election observers led by Jimmy Carter and became involved in work on election monitoring and electoral fraud, eventually leading to Gibson's work in a variety of countries. Gibson received his Ph.D. from Duke, then held several positions at Indiana University. While at I.U., he worked on common pool resources with political economist Elinor Olstrom PhD at her Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis. Olstrom subsequently won the Nobel Prize in Economics with Oliver E. Williamson for her \"analysis of economic governance, especially the commons\". In 2001, Gibson joined the Department of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego as a tenured faculty member. Gibson's academic work has mainly concentrated on issues and countries in Africa. He has undertaken extensive studies on the subjects of foreign aid and political accountability. Most recently, he has worked on using technology, specifically cellphones, to minimize electoral fraud in Afghanistan, Uganda, Kenya, and South Africa. Gibson's work, coauthored with Karen Ferree and James Long, helped to point to discrepancies in the controversial results of 2007 Kenyan elections. Gibson conducted an extensive exit poll in the election on behalf of the International Republican Institute and USAID. After the election poll's results were made available by Gibson, Feree, and Long, the results became subject to controversy due to the International Republican Institute's delay in releasing the poll results. The delay and its impact on public perceptions on the validity of the elections received international press."

She studied under Mary Watson Whitney at Vassar and was the first woman to earn a PhD in astronomy from Columbia. Furness was born on 24 June 1869 in Cleveland, Ohio. Her father was a high school science teacher and encouraged her early interest in science. She graduated from Vassar in 1887 and followed in her fathers footsteps becoming a high school science teacher, her true interest was in research though and after three years she returned to Vassar as a research assistant for Mary Watson Whitney. Under Whitney she took part in a nearly decade long program of comet and planet observations. In 1996 she began working at Columbia University under Harold Jacoby and would publish her Ph.D. dissertation \"Catalogue of stars within one degree of the North pole and optical distortion of the Helsingfors astro-photographic telescope deduced from photographic measures\" there in 1900. In 1903 she returned to Vassar as an instructor. She collaborated on variable star observations with Whitney from 1909 to 1911. In 1915, she authored the authoritative textbook Introduction to the Study of Variable Stars. She became a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1922. She died on 9 February 1936 in New York. She was an advocate for women's education, particularly in other countries, she wrote a number of articles about the situation of women's higher education in Japan, and an important member of the local branch of the National Alliance of Unitarian Women."

  "text" : "Costin Ion Murgescu (October 27, 1919 – August 30, 1989) was a Romanian economist, jurist, journalist and diplomat. A supporter of fascism during his youth, he switched to communism by the end of World War II, and became an editor of the Communist Party daily organ, România Liberă. He taught at the University of Bucharest and worked for the Economic Research Institute. Having campaigned for multilateralism in world affairs as early as 1944, he helped to distance Romania from the Soviet Union after 1964, and later represented his country at the United Nations. He wrote extensively, publishing works on the effects of land reform and industrialization, on the history of economic thought, and on Romania's relations with the Comecon and the First World. An innovator among the Romanian communist intellectual and professional elite, Murgescu spent his final decades questioning the assumptions of Marxian economics. At the Institute for World Economy, which later became a branch of the Romanian Academy, he trained a new generation of like-minded economists. Shortly before his death, he was involved in dissidence against the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime. Although he did not live long enough to witness the 1989 Revolution, he played an indirect part in shaping the economic policies to which the country turned in post-communism. The estranged son of Lieutenant Colonel Murgescu, a convicted war criminal, Costin Murgescu was married to Ecaterina Oproiu, a Romanian writer and social commentator. He was survived by his nephew and disciple, historian Bogdan Murgescu."

  "text" : "Camillo Paolo Filippo Giulio Benso, Count of Cavour, Isolabella and Leri (August 10, 1810 – June 6, 1861), generally known as Cavour (Italian: [kaˈvur]) was an Italian statesman and a leading figure in the movement toward Italian unification. He was the founder of the original Liberal Party and Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, a position he maintained (except for a six-month resignation) throughout the Second Italian War of Independence and Garibaldi's campaigns to unite Italy. After the declaration of a united Kingdom of Italy, Cavour took office as the first Prime Minister of Italy; he died after only three months in office, and thus did not live to see Venetia or Rome added to the new Italian nation. Cavour put forth several economic reforms in his native region of Piedmont in his earlier years, and founded the political newspaper Il Risorgimento. After being elected to the Chamber of Deputies, he quickly rose in rank through the Piedmontese government, coming to dominate the Chamber of Deputies through a union of left-center and right-center politicians. After a large rail system expansion program, Cavour became prime minister in 1852. As prime minister, Cavour successfully negotiated Piedmont's way through the Crimean War, the Second Italian War of Independence, and Garibaldi's expeditions, managing to maneuver Piedmont diplomatically to become a new great power in Europe, controlling a nearly united Italy that was five times as large as Piedmont had been before he came to power."

  "text" : "Charlie Cotton is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Declan Bennett. He first appeared on 10 March 2014. He was introduced as the grandson of established character, Dot Branning, played by June Brown and the son of original character, Nick Cotton (John Altman). The character and casting was announced on 22 January 2014. Charlie arrived to inform Dot, who was unaware of his existence, that Nick had died, but it later transpired that this was not the truth as Nick returned in October. His storylines have included: his desperation to keep Nick's fake death secret; his relationships with Dot and mother, Yvonne Cotton (Pauline McLynn); a one-night-stand with Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) which resulted in her pregnancy and their marriage; the car accident that resulted in the birth of his son, Matthew and Ronnie being left in a coma; his affair with Ronnie's sister, Roxy (Rita Simons); the breakdown of his marriage and subsequent departure. It was announced on 23 July 2015 that Bennett had been axed by show bosses. Charlie's last episode was broadcast on 24 September 2015, where viewers were left wondering if Charlie had been killed by Ronnie and Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), though he is later revealed to be alive."

  "text" : "Carlo Maria Polvani (born 28 July 1965) is a Roman Catholic priest and currently a member of the Committee for the reform for the Vatican Media since his appointment in July 2014. Polvani was born in Milan. He was educated in the Istituto Leone XIII and then in the Collège Stanislas, he earned a Baccalauréat Français Section Scientifique avec mention in 1982. He enrolled in McGill University, Canada in the Department of Biochemistry and received in 1985, a B.Sc. with honours and in 1990 a Ph.D Dean’s Honour List, for his research on the enzymatic mechanism of the Sodium Potassium ATPase. He decided to become a priest, and took a degree of Master of Divinity with distinction, in 1993, at the Weston School of Theology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. He received from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, a Licence summa cum laude in Canon Law (JCL) in 1995 and a Specialization summa cum laude in Jurisprudence and Forensic Psychology in 1996. He was admitted to the Pontifical Lombard Seminary in Rome, and was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Milan by Cardinal Martini on 14 February 1998. He completed his Doctorate in Canon Law summa cum laude in 1999 with the examination of a distinctively canonical activity: the authentic interpretation of laws. He was summoned to the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in Rome, and was called to the Diplomatic Service of the Holy See, on 1 July 1999, to serve as Secretary in the Apostolic Nunciature in México. He was then called to the Secretariat of State, and in 2007 was put in charge of the Information and Documentation Office in the Section for General Affairs, as well as being the Representative of the Holy See in the Government Advisory Committee of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Polvani was a witness during the trial of Claudio Sciarpelletti, computer specialist at the Secretariat of State in the Vatileaks scandal. Polvani is Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò’s nephew. In July 2014 he was appointed a member of the Committee for the reform for the Vatican Media, with members Lord Patten of Barnes (president), Msgr. Lucio Adrián Ruiz, Msgr. Paul Tighe, Fr. Giacomo Ghisani, Fr. Eric Salobir, O.P. Prof. Giovanni Maria Vian, Gregory Erlandson, George Yeo, Daniela Frank and Leticia Soberon. The committee was appointed to propose reforms for the Vatican Media. The committee is to publish a report and a reform plan within 12 months after considering the report of the Pontifical Commission for Reference on the Organisation of the Economic-Administrative Structure of the Holy See. The objectives are to adapt the Holy See media to changing trends, enhance coordination, and make substantial financial savings. Following initiatives such as the Pope App and Pope Francis's Twitter account, digital channels will be set up for the Pope's messages to reach the faithful around the world, especially young people."

Her mother, a house wife, is the offspring of a noted philanthropist, Lee His-Cin. While majoring in Fine Arts at National Taiwan Normal University, Chung-Chuan Cheng joined the Fifth Moon Art Group encouraged to set up by a painting professor Ji-Chun Liao in 1957. By the end of the same year, she gave up the teaching and decided to reside in Japan with her husband. The artist had stopped working any paintings for more than 30 years until she was nearly 60. She not only started to hold solo exhibitions in Japan but also returned to Taiwan for joining annual exhibitions of the Fifth Moon Art Group. Just before her eightieth, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall staged her art retrospective exhibition in 2011. Besides, a private charity organization also took place a bazaar of her works for the benefit of the mental and physical disabled residents in Hsin-Chu.。In 2013, Taipei Fine Arts Museum invited Chung-Chuan Cheng to join the group exhibition “Women Adventurers: Five Eras of Taiwanese Art, 1930-1983”. At present, the artist enjoys leading a tranquil life and contentedly creating works."

  "text" : "Charles 'Charlie' Kostboth was a legislator in the 3rd South Dakota House of Representatives session from 1893 to 1894. He represented McCook County, South Dakota, then in the 11th District. Charles was born to Wilhelm Kostboth and Maria Sophia Dorothea Muller in Prussia, Germany. The 12-year-old Kostboth came to the United States from Germany with his parents in April 1865, through the port of New York City. They lived on a farm near McGregor, Iowa. Charles married Catherine Metzger on September 27, 1877, near her home in Clayton Center, Iowa. They moved to South Dakota two years later, claiming a homestead five miles northwest of Canistota, on the west half of section 17. Charles's parents also moved to Canistota, and his father died at Charles's farmhouse in 1900. The couple lived as pioneers on the sparse Dakota prairie where, as Charles' obituary notes, \"even claim shanties were few and far between.\" Charles became an American citizen by appearing at the US District Court in the second district of Dakota Territory before Judge AJ Edgerton on November 14, 1883, where Kostboth \"renounced allegiance to the Emperor of Germany [sic].\" While on the homestead, Charles was active in public matters and held township and school offices. A doctor came from Sioux City, Iowa, and successfully performed an appendectomy on Charles who lay on the farm kitchen table. Kostboth increased the size of his farm and became one of the wealthier members of the Canistota community. He was known for his charity and generosity. Charles, Catherine, and eight children lived on the homestead until 1912, when they moved to the town of Canistota. Kostboth was a founding member of German Lutheran Church (now Zion Lutheran Church) in Canistota. At the end of his life, Charles was president of Citizens State Bank in Canistota and Dakota State Bank in Salem, as well as treasurer of two grain elevator companies. Kostboth suffered two partial paralytic strokes, three years and one year before his death in 1923. His cause of death was listed as senility, with secondary contributions from \"chronic nephritis and hardening of the arteries\", which were complications from an illness contracted around 1914. Charles Kostboth was buried on January 11, 1923, in the Canistota cemetery."

  "text" : "Charles Ashford Binger ( October 12th, 1907, London -- 1974) was an English American artist and illustrator. During the 1920s and 1930s, he began his career painting film posters for Twentieth Century Fox UK, then served in WW2 as a member of the London Fire Service and Air Sea Rescue. He also supplied art for campaigns such as the wartime English Savings Bond Campaign. After the war, he moved to New York City, and began painting covers for Colliers Magazine, Fawcett Publications, Signet Books, Pyramid Books, Pocket Books, Bantam Books, Avon Books, and other publishers.  His cover art was used on books by Nathanael West, Aldous Huxley, John Collier, Ray Bradbury, Erle Stanley Gardner, and many more.  Binger continued to paint movie posters, for such films as River of No Return, Titanic, The Song of Bernadette, Run Silent Run Deep, and The Comancheros. Binger was also a popular pin-up artist. He is perhaps best remembered for his science fiction covers in the 1950s, and for his covers for hard-boiled detective pulps. Binger continued to work until 1970, and died in 1974. A major retrospective show of his work was held in Los Angeles in 2011."

They then went to the island of Aran Mor in Ireland where they spent 4 years building churches, after which they moved to the Llŷn Peninsula at Cricieth. They finally established an important monastery at Holyhead, Anglesey, from where Cyngar founded the church at Llangefni.

Having worked as a full-time employee for Sung Shin, Choi trained throughout his sporting career as a member of its wrestling team under head coach Bang Dae-du. Choi highlighted his sporting career at the 2003 Asian Wrestling Championships in Delhi, India, where he captured a gold medal over India's Sanjay Kumar in the 74-kg division with a comfortable 7–0 decision. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Choi qualified for the South Korean squad, as a 28-year-old, in the men's 74 kg class. Earlier in the process, he placed third in the same class at the Asian Championships in Almaty, Kazakhstan to guarantee a spot on South Korea's Olympic wrestling team. He lost his opening match 2–6 to two-time reigning Olympic champion Filiberto Azcuy of Cuba, but bounced back to oust Poland's Radosław Truszkowski with a challenging 6–1 verdict. Placing second in the prelim pool and tenth overall, Choi failed to advance to the quarterfinals."

  "text" : "Chen Sanli (1853 -1937), aka Boyan, Sanyuan Laoren, was a Chinese poet who wrote in the classical style in the early modern era. He was descended from a Fujianese Hakka family that had settled in Yining (now Xiushui), Jiangxi Province [Kowallis, p. 169]. Along with Zheng Xiaoxu and Shen Zengzhi, he became one of the leading figures of the Tongguang school, which was related to but not identical with the Song poetry style [Kowallis, pp. 168-208]. From 1889 Chen Sanli served as a civil servant, and with his father Chen Baozhen (1831-1900), the governor-general of Hunan and an associate of Tan Sitong and Kang Youwei, he led local reform in Hunan, which became a model in the minds of reformists for the entire country. After the Empress Dowager suppressed the Hundred Days Reform of 1898, the Chens were forced to leave the government and go into internal exile near Nanchang. His father died shortly thereafter, which greatly saddened the son. He then moved to a villa he built outside Jinling (Nanjing) called Sanyuan Jingshe (The Sanyuan Retreat), from which Chen Sanli derived his pen-name. After the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, Chen Sanli declined to serve in government under the Republic, but he was not a Qing yilao [loyalist] in the classic sense. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, he is said to have committed suicide by starvation in protest at the Japanese invasion. Chen Yan, the main theorist of the poetics of the Tongguang school, characterized Chen Sanli's poetry as \"obscure and profound\" (生涩奥衍). Chen Sanli was said to have learned from the Northern Song poet Huang Tingjian, but he did not imitate, he developed this style [Kowallis, p. 194]. Many of Chen's poems reflect the chaos and suffering of the Chinese people during the early 20th century. One of Chen Sanli's sons became a famous painter. Another, the historian Chen Yinke, was an eminent authority on Buddhism and the institutional history of Tang-era China [Lo and Schultz, p. 351]. Further Reading: Kowallis, Jon Eugene von.

  "text" : "Chester Cornett (1913–1981) was an American chair-maker and self-taught artist. His life and work have been the subject of monographic treatment both by regional museums and the University of Kentucky Press. His grandfather, Cal Foutch, taught him the carpentry of chairmaking. Cornett worked in many styles: \"pegged and slat-backed armchairs, rockers, and folding chairs from a variety of local woods, weaving seats from hickory bark.\" This artisanal mastery was, alas, becoming an anachronism by the time of Cornett's life, yet the carpenter stubbornly kept at his craft, enduring considerable poverty in consequence. A unique work in his oeuvre is the \"Crucifix\" in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum. The stories are contradictory, but the ironical legend is that, with much of the world in turmoil in 1968, Cornett dreamed that eastern Kentucky would soon experience a biblical deluge, and prepared to be a second Noah by making an ark. Cornett carved a \"Crucifix\" for the bow of this ark, which was twenty-feet long. The irony is that a tempest did indeed arrive, and the ark was destroyed. For many years, it was thought that the crucifix had survived. In 2014, Kentucky Folk Art Center (\"KFAC\") presented the first comprehensive exhibition of Cornett's work, \"Chester Cornett: Beyond The Narrow Sky\", complete with an extensive, illustrated catalogue. During the research, a short super 8 film of the ark shot by Kentucky writer Gurney Norman was discovered that showed a different crucifix, the original, that must indeed have been destroyed along with the ark. It turns out that Cornett created the crucifix now at the American Folk Art Museum once he had relocated from the mountains to the area around Cincinnati, Ohio."

  "text" : "Christine Athena Horner is an American plastic surgeon, author, professional speaker, and activist for the prevention of breast cancer through holistic and alternative medicine methods. She is regarded as an expert on the subject of breast cancer. She appears frequently on television and speaks on radio to promote breast cancer prevention methods including lifestyle choices, vaccines, dietary choices such as eating less red meat and less sugar and reducing alcohol consumption, getting adequate sleep, and having better relationships. Her book Waking the Warrior Goddess discussed her ideas about breast cancer prevention. She was instrumental in a five-year-long public relations campaign to make insurance companies pay for breast reconstruction surgery following mastectomies by making it a federal law. She is certified with the National Board of Surgery and the National Board of Plastic Surgery. She has recently been critical of Christianity, especially the Catholic Church, claiming some of the latter's religious rituals are \"divisive\" and \"the root of all evil behavior.\""

Cheng was admitted by the National Sun Yat-sen University in Canton, China, to study medicine in 1948. His study was interrupted in 1950 when he reunited with his family in Macau. In 1960, he was recruited by the All India Radio in Delhi, India, as a Chinese-language announcer. In 1965, he was recruited by the British Broadcasting Corporation radio station to perform interpretation and broadcasting work in the United Kingdom. In April 1972, Cheng was appointed by the Hong Kong government as a Chief Interpreter (Simultaneous Interpretation) to help introduce Chinese-English simultaneous interpretation service for the Legislative Council. When the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China conducted successive rounds of negotiations over the sovereignty of Hong Kong between 1982 and 1984, he was the chief interpreter for the British delegation, serving various British representatives including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Governor of Hong Kong Sir Edward Youde and British Ambassador to China Sir Percy Cradock, etc. After the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed on 19 December 1984, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours of 1985 in recognition of his service. Before retiring from the government in 1987, he was further promoted to the rank of Chief Conference Interpreter in June 1986."

  "text" : "Carlo Cattàneo (31 October 1911, San Giorgio Piacentino – 7 March 1979, Rome) was an Italian academic and one of the general relativity theorists and mathematical physicists in the 1960s and 1970s. He made contributions to general relativity theory, fluid mechanics, and elasticity theory. After secondary and university studies in Rome, Cattaneo received a laurea (PhD) in civil engineering in 1934 and a laurea (PhD) in mathematics in 1936 from the University of Rome. In 1938 he was appointed an assistant and in 1940 a docent at the University of Rome. From 1949 to 1957 he was a professor at the University of Pisa. In 1957 he was appointed a professor at the University of Rome, where he worked under the guidance of Tullio Levi-Civita. Cattaneo remained a professor at the University of Rome for the rest of his life. Cattaneo was the author of introductory textbooks on classical mechanics, fluid mechanics and the theory of relativity. His textbooks were widely used in Italy and made him known as an author or co-author of the best known college textbooks in the field of mathematical physics in Italy. Catteneo also appears to have been the first to develop a hyperbolic model for heat conduction in 1948. The resulting constitutive equation relating the heat flux and its time rate of change to the temperature gradient has become known as the \"Maxwell–Catteneo law\" due to the fact that James Clerk Maxwell suggested a similar relation in 1867. From 1972 to 1976 Cattaneo was vice-president of the Comitato Nazionale della Matematica (National Committee of Mathematics) of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (National Research Council) of Italy. He was elected a member of the International Committee on General Relativity in 1962. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Lille and was elected a member of the Accademia dei Lincei. His doctoral studients include Carlos Aragone."

Budworth was the son of Philip John Budworth, of Greensted Hall, Essex. His elder brother Richard Budworth played international rugby union football for England. He was commissioned a second-lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery on 15 February 1889, promoted to lieutenant on 15 February 1892, and to captain on 29 March 1899. In October that year he was appointed Adjutant of the Honourable Artillery Company of London (HAC), and on 12 January 1900 he commissioned as a captain in the HAC company of the City of London Imperial Volunteers (CIV) bound for service in the Second Boer War. He left for South Africa the following month, and returned with most of the corps in October the same year. The CIV was disbanded in December 1900, and he went back to regular service with the Royal Artillery. During the First World War, he was General Sir Henry Rawlinson's senior artillery adviser, at IV Corps (October 1915 to March 1916) and at Fourth Army from May 1916 until the Armistice in November 1918. He played a key role in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive at the Battles of Hamel, Amiens, and the final attack on the Hindenburg Line. In 1919 he was appointed to command 59th (2nd North Midland) Division which trained drafts for service in Egypt and the Black Sea until it was demobilised. He was ten times mentioned in dispatches. He died in Simla, British India, and was buried in Simla Old Cemetery. Budworth married Winifred Nickalls, daughter of Sir Patteson Nickalls, but was widowed in 1914. He remarried Helen Blewitt, daughter of W. E. Blewitt, in 1918. They had two sons."

  "text" : "Chris de Broglio (May 14, 1930 – July 12, 2014) was a Mauritian-born South African weightlifter and anti-Apartheid activist. De Broglio, who advocated for an end to racism in sports, played a key role within the movement to expel South Africa from the Olympics in 1970, during the height of country's Apartheid era. He joined with Dennis Brutus to co-found the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (San-Roc). According to Nelson Mandela, the expulsion of South Africa in the 1970s revitalized the anti-Apartheid movement at the time and ultimately led to the end of Apartheid twenty years later. De Broglio was born Marie Christian Dubruel de Broglio in Mauritius on May 14, 1930, to Maurice and Suzanne de Broglio. He took up weightlifting after a longterm, mysterious illness originally left him smaller than other kids his age. De Broglio originally moved to South Africa to study accounting. De Broglio was a South African weightlifting champion from 1950 until 1962. He competed at the World Championships in Sweden in 1958 and Vienna, Austria, in 1961. However, he was disturbed that white and black weightlifters were forbidden from competing or training together in South Africa. During his tenure as the chairman and secretary of both the Natal and Transvaal Weightlifting Associations, De Broglio organized multi-racial weightlifting competitions, which were illegal under Apartheid. In the early 1960s, De Broglio, who was employed by Air France at the time, arranged for the chairman of the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (San-Roc), John Harris, to secretly leave South Africa. Harris testified against the Apartheid system before the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which resulted in the exclusion of South Africa from participation in the 1964 Summer Olympics. (Harris would later be executed for his role in the bombing of a white-only section of the Johannesburg Park Station). In 1963, De Broglio's organization, San-Roc, successfully lobbied for the suspension of South Africa from international football. De Broglio was placed under state surveillance and forced into exile in London, settling in Twickenham. There, De Broglio and others reestablished San-Roc in the basement of the Portman Court Hotel in Marble Arch. De Broglio organized a San-Roc boycott of the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City by a number of African and Asian nations. In 1997, De Broglio was awarded the Olympic Order for his work against racism in athletics and his defense of the Olympic Charter. De Broglio lived in Corsica during his later life. He frequented the gym until he was 80 years old. He died on July 12, 2014, at the age of 84. His first wife, June Von Solms, whom he married in 1954 and with whom he had six children, died in 1982. He was survived by his children and his second wife, Renee de Broglio, whom he married in 1988."

In his two first-class cricket games, he was a tail-end batsman and a bowler, and neither his batting nor his bowling style are known; he made little impression in either game. In minor cricket, he played for Devon and other amateur sides through to the mid 1880s. Luxton graduated from Cambridge University in 1883 and was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. He was curate at Lifton, Devon and Milverton in Somerset before becoming the vicar of Langford Budville, Somerset in 1894, where he remained until his death."

In the French media, in June 2014 Beaugrand was hailed as France’s new hope for national and international triathlon events, but Beaugrand was already internationally known from 2013 on when she won the 1500m race at the EYOF (European Olympic Youth Festival) on 17 July 2013 in Utrecht. Beaugrand is also the French 2013 and 2014 Youth Champion in cross country, and in 2013 and 2014 she also set the new national records for 1500m in her age class (youth/cadette).On 27 October 2014 Beaugrand also set a new youth record on the 10 km distance (called semi-marathon or Voie Royale) in Saint-Denis. Beaugrand lives in Antibes where she is still coached by her father and in 2014/15 she attends the local Lycée Audiberti, where she will take the high school diploma in 2015 (French BAC / baccalauréat économique et social).The local swimming club CN Antibes serves as her training base."

  "text" : "Cesar Augusto Sciammarella (born August 22, 1924) has made significant contributions to the field of experimental mechanics. In the last decade he has extended his pioneering developments in moiré, holography, and speckle interferometry methodologies down to the nanometric level. These efforts have resulted in the field of optics to go beyond the classical Rayleigh limit reaching the nanometer range and in the electron microscopy to resolutions of the order of atomic distances. His fundamental research is widely used for 3D reconstruction, and stress and strain analysis. In his Doctoral Thesis on the Moiré method he extended the Continuum Mechanics model originally developed by Dantu to large deformations. He developed fundamental equations on the properties of moiré fringes, signs conventions. Furthermore, he applied the moiré method to the solution of a plasticity problem, this was the first complete analysis of a non elastic problem with the moiré method. Dr. Sciammarella generalized the concept of fringe order in methods that measure displacements using Fourier analysis in the process of formation of the fringe images. He proved formally that the orders could be represented by real numbers instead of integers as it was usual at the time of his publication. In 1966, he presented a full model of the moiré fringes as phase modulated signals and provided a method to obtain displacements and strains for moiré and photo-elastic fringes. He introduced for the first time in the literature the Fourier method as a tool for fringe pattern analysis. His model stands today as a standard model used in the fringe analysis methodology."

Charles was also a superb marksman and often practised in his spare time with a miniature rifle. On 14 October 1908, his body was discovered on the police athletic grounds in Liverpool with a gunshot wound through the heart, and his rifle was found nearby. An inquest into his death was held, but it could not be determined if he had committed suicide. At his funeral, his coffin was carried to its final place of rest by six members of the tug of war team."

  "text" : "Charles-Ferdinand Lenepveu (4 October 1840 – 16 August 1910), was a French composer and teacher. Destined for a career as a lawyer, he defied his family and followed a musical career. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire, and won France's top musical award, the Prix de Rome in 1867. Much of Lenepveu's career was as a professor at the Conservatoire from 1880. He was known as a strict conservative, hostile to musical innovation, as was much of the French musical Establishment of the time. He was expected to succeed Théodore Dubois as director of the Conservatoire in 1905, but his chances evaporated when he was implicated in an attempt to rig the results of that year's Prix de Rome in favour of his own pupils."

  "text" : "Christopher Thomas Knight (born 7 December 1965), also known as the North Pond Hermit, is a former hermit who lived almost without human contact for 27 years in the woods in Maine. He survived by committing approximately 1,000 burglaries against houses in the area, or approximately 40 per year. Apart from the fear and notoriety his many burglaries created in the local area, Knight's unusual life also attracted widespread international media reports upon his capture. Knight entered the woods in 1986, aged 20, without saying goodbye to anyone, and was captured during a burglary in 2013. His only human contact in that time was one exchange of a trivial greeting with a hiker. Knight's parents apparently never reported him missing to the police. In an interview, Knight said, \"I had good parents\", and, \"We're not emotionally bleeding all over each other. We're not touchy-feely. Stoicism is expected.\" The family's next-door neighbor for 14 years hasn't exchanged more than a few words with Knight's mother. Many have expressed admiration for Knight's outdoor survival skills, especially in the harsh Maine winters. Some also expressed doubt, believing instead that Knight broke into and took refuge in vacant cabins. Knight was sentenced to seven months in jail on 28 October 2013, of which he had already served all but a week while awaiting sentencing. In addition to the jail sentence, Knight paid $1,500 in restitution to victims, completed a Co-Occurring Disorders Court Program (designed for people with substance abuse problems and mental health disorders), and must complete three years of probation. Knight has described deep-felt ethical misgivings about the burglaries committed, saying that stealing is wrong. Even the prosecutor said that a longer sentence would have been cruel. Judge Nancy Mills believes it is very unlikely that Knight will re-offend.  After release, Knight met with the judge every week, avoided alcohol, and secured a job with his brother."

  "text" : "Claudius Stephen Magnay (8 May 1819 – 17 December 1870), known as Claude, was an English clergyman, a writer, and a cricketer who played first-class cricket in a single match for Cambridge University in 1841. He was born at Clapham, London and died at Bedford. Magnay was the son of Christopher Magnay who was Lord Mayor of London in 1821-22 and the brother of Sir William Magnay, 1st Baronet, who was Lord Mayor in 1843. He was educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey and at Clare College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge University, he made a single appearance for the university cricket team in a match at Lord's against Marylebone Cricket Club; he batted at No 11 and failed to score in either innings, being not out once. The scorecard for the match is incomplete and it is not known if he bowled. After graduating from Cambridge, Magnay was ordained as a clergyman in the Church of England; he was curate at parishes in Hampshire, Dorset and, from 1857 to his death in 1870, at Hemyock in Devon. He was also a published author and poet; among his books is a novel, Reginald Græme, or Visible and Invisible."

  "text" : "Chung Eun-yong (1923 – August 1, 2014) was a South Korean policeman and activist. Chung initiated a decades long investigation into the July 1950 No Gun Ri Massacre by elements of the 7th Cavalry Regiment during the early days of the Korean War. Survivors estimated 100 people were killed in the No Gun Ri air attack and another 300 refugees died in attacks under a nearby railroad bridge. Chung Eun-yong's four-year-old son and two-year-old daughter were among the victims killed, while his wife, Park Sun-yong, suffered serious injuries. Chung Eun-yong, who returned to his pre-war job as a police officer in Daejeon in the mid-1950s, learned that the United States was accepting claims for damages related to the Korean War in 1960. He joined with several survivors of the No Gun Ri Massacre, but the group missed the application deadline. Chung quietly continued to gather evidence at archives in Seoul and Daejeon for the next three decades during South Korea's authoritarian military rule. Professionally, he worked for a government agency which combated potential Communist threats to South Korea. He also partnered to operate a small bottle manufacturing plant in Daejeon. He retired in the 1980s. Still the loss of his children never left him. He was later quoted by the Associated Press, \"No Gun Ri never escaped my mind one single day.\" In early 1990s, South Korea's military dictatorship was replaced by a democratic government. By this time, Chung Eun-yong had concluded, through his research, that the 1st Cavalry Division, the parent unit of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, bore the responsibility for the No Gun Ri Massacre. Chung concluded that South Korea's transition to democracy had finally given him the opportunity to speak out on the No Gun Ri Massacre for the first time since the 1960s. A wrote a novel, \"Do You Know Our Agony?\", based on the events of the No Gun Ri, but it was rejected by ten different publishers due to the controversial nature of his charges. The book was finally published in 1994. Chung Eun-yong also began a series of petitions to the American government in the early 1990s. He demanded a full investigation, an apology and compensation for survivors and victim's families. His petitions were ignored or dismissed until a 1999 investigation by Associated Press uncovered evidence which corroborated the accusations of Chung and other survivors. The Associated Press interviewed U.S. veterans who were near the site of the massacre and found declassified U.S. files stating that commanders had ordered their forces to shoot civilians in the war zone. While other news organizations, U.S. News & World Report, founded flaws with the AP's investigation, including an false eyewitness account by veteran Edward L. Daily, who was later proven not to have been at No Gun Ri, the AP investigation strengthened Chung's claims. Chung's petitions and the AP's stories caused American and South Korean authorities to launch an investigation. The United States Army first acknowledged the killings at No Gun Ri in January 2001, but did not assign blame for the massacre. U.S. President Bill Clinton issued a statement of regret concerning No Gun Ri, but did not offer a formal apology. No compensation was offered to victims or survivors at the time. Chung and his allies called the investigation a \"whitewash.\" The also rejected a U.S. offers to set up a scholarship fund and build a monument at No Gun Ri, which would have been dedicated to all of the Korean War's civilian victims rather than a specific memorial to those killed at No Gun Ri. The South Korean National Assembly created a committee to identify No Gun Ri victims in 2004. In 2005, the committee found 163 dead or missing victims and fifty-five wounded, while noting that reports were not submitted on many additional victims. Lawmakers also gave medical subsidies for survivors and established No Gun Ri Peace Park, a 29-acre park at the site, in 2004. In 1999, Chung joined with American veterans of No Gun Ri at a reconciliation service held at a church in Cleveland, Ohio. Chung Eun-yong was born in Chu Gok Ri, Korea, in 1923. He wanted to be an architect, but only had the money to attend railroad school. He became a telegraph operator for the Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Korea, but left the job following a fistfight with a Japanese co-worker. He joined the Korean National Police in 1944 to avoid being drafted into the Japanese Army during World War II. Shortly after joining the police, Chung married his wife, Park Sun-yong, in an arranged marriage, which he been set up by a fortune teller. He quit the police in 1949, citing corruption, and enrolled at law school in Seoul. The outbreak of the Korean War cut short his studies. Chung Eun-yong, who had been in declining health, died on August 1, 2014, at his home in Daejeon, South Korea, at the age of 91. He was survived by his wife of 69 years, Park Sun-yong, and a son born after the Korean War, Chung Koo-do. Chung Koo-do is the chairman of the No Gun Ri International Peace Foundation, which operates the No Gun Ri Peace Park."

Countryman was most recognized for designing a number of complex and effective microphones for performance. He is best known for the E6 earset and Type 85 Direct Box. His work was nominated for the 2002 National Association of Music Merchants Technical Excellence & Creativity Awards. Countryman engineered a number of devices that enabled the multimedia and psychedelic art scenes of the 1960s and 1970s. Multimedia artist Tony Martin (artist) cited Countryman's custom electronics as key to his cybernetic feedback art in the 1960s. Countryman's electronics coupled photosensors, microphones, and other electronics in two briefcases Martin could use as he staged shows in different cities. Martin cites Countryman's electronic innovations as crucial to his art. In the early 1970s, his piano pickups enabled the Grateful Dead musician Keith Godchaux to use Steinway grand pianos as part of their famous Wall of Sound. The pickups worked similarly to condenser mics, allowing the musicians to produce \"truly brilliant\" sound compared to microphone amplification, according to Owsley Stanley. The pickup technology used the piano string itself as part of the circuit. The technology, developed for the Grateful Dead, became a part of many musical performers' rigs. Other custom amplification included a clavichord pickup built for keyboardist Jim Lowe."

He continued his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he earned his bachelor's degree in architecture in 1941. The outbreak of World War II interrupted his masteral studies as he enlisted in the army, eventually assigned to be alongside Manuel Quezon and the Philippine Commonwealth government-in-exile in Washington, D.C. and as an intelligence officer under General Chuck Parsons in Australia. He returned to MIT after the war to complete his master's degree in architecture, which he obtained in 1946."

  "text" : "Curtis Earl Boozman, Sr. (July 24, 1898 – April 22, 1979), was a Democrat who served two nonconsecutive terms in the Louisiana House of Representatives from Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana. His first term from 1952 to 1956 corresponded with the administration of Governor Robert F. Kennon; his second, from 1960 to 1964, with the second term of Governor Jimmie Davis. In the second term, he served alongside the young newcomer, Paul L. Foshee. Boozman served in the United States Army during World War I; his son, Curtis, Jr. (1925-1993), was a United States Navy sailor in World War II. He was married to Marion C. Boozman (1899-1989). His daughter-in-law, the former Mary Ellen Smith, was born in 1929. In 1954, Boozman, along with Representative Monnie T. Cheves and State Senator Sylvan Friedman, pushed for passage of legislation to permit Northwestern State University in Natchitoches to confer the master of education degree. The measure, known as House Bill 343, was signed into law by Governor Kennon. Originally known as \"Normal\", Northwestern was for many years the only state-supported teacher education institution in the state. In September 1960, Representative Boozman was among the many political dignitaries who traveled to Winnfield for the burial of former Governor Earl Kemp Long. Boozman owned a Creole cottage built about 1900 and located at 212 Rue Second Street in Natchitoches. The building is now called the American Inn. Boozman, his wife, and son are interred at American Cemetery in Natchitoches."

  "text" : "Charles Wesley Powell (5 May 1854 – 18 August 1927) was an American hobbyist turned horticulturist specializing in the study of orchids (Orchidaceae). He is credited with providing scientists the first large-scale collection of orchid specimens found in Panama. In the early 1900s, he became internationally famous for his new discoveries and valuable contributions to orchidology by gathering, rediscovering, cultivating, preserving, documenting, and submitting-for-study a diverse assortment of hundreds of distinct specimens: yielding many new to science species. Powell's specimen records (also known as herbarium specimens) and his Panama garden were studied by researchers at the Royal Botanical Gardens, the Berlin Botanical Garden, the Orchid Herbarium of Oakes Ames at Harvard University, the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution, and the Missouri Botanical Garden (MBG). Dozens of orchid species were named in his honor. In 1922, German botanist Rudolf Schlechter published his 95-page Orchidaceae Powellianae Panamenses (Panama orchid collections by C. Powell): principally on the basis ofPowell's efforts. Powell's work remains relevant not only because his records document valuable scientific data, but they continue to provide material for study – many of his digitized herbarium specimens are freely available online via virtual herbaria. In 1926, Powell donated his world-class orchid garden (orchidarium) to the renowned MBG of St. Louis, Missouri. Under Powell's direction, a Tropical Station was created by the MBG in Balboa, Panama; 7,000 plants from Powell's orchid garden populated the satellite operation. For the MBG, a snowball effect occurred in the tropics; orchid collecting began there in earnest and over the next 13 years, orchids from its Tropical Station would appreciably augment the collection of the parent garden in St. Louis. \"Today, the Missouri Botanical Garden’s orchid collection represents one of the largest and finest in the United States.\""

  "text" : "Claude Franceschi (born October 12, 1942) is an angiologist French MD. He is considered as a pioneer of Doppler ultrasound vascular investigation. His works are recognized worldwide, bringing a significant contribution to hemodynamics, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the arteries, veins and lymphatics. In the 1980s, he revolutionized the concept of venous disease with a new hemodynamic approach that led, instead of veins ablation, to conservative and hemodynamic ambulatory treatment of venous insufficiency (CHIVA). He further proposed a new theory regarding the hemorrhoid disease. For him, the main cause of this pathology is not due to the hemorrhoid veins but to a \"fourth factor\" i.e. the irritation of the anal canal. Consequently, he offered its treatment and prevention by a simple hygiene process. Finally, he discovered through Doppler ultrasound a disease of the lymphatic system related to the intermittent obstruction of the cervical thoracic duct The recurrent cervical swelling syndrome."

  "text" : "Charles Graux (23 November 1852 – 8 January 1882) was a French classicist and palaeographer. Apart from scores of articles and reviews, he published important critical editions of works by Xenophon and Plutarch and pioneering, descriptive catalogs of the medieval copies of ancient Greek texts preserved in the libraries of Spain and Denmark. His most enduring contributions were to the history of ancient stichometry. In an article that Ohly called ‘epoch-making’ he proved that ancient Greek authors and scribes measured the length of prose texts in standard lines just as modern books are measured in pages and computer files in words. This standard unit, he showed, was equal in length to a Greek hexameter (about fifteen syllables or 35 letters). Graux’s survey of hundreds of ancient stichometric line-counts preserved in medieval manuscripts confirmed that the same standard line was in use from the fourth century BCE through the Christian authors of late antiquity. These results launched the rigorous study of ancient stichometry during the golden age of papyrology and led to Ohly’s definitive monograph fifty years later. Stichometry now plays a small but useful role in the study of ancient Greek and Latin papyri, and especially of the scrolls evacuated in Herculaneum. Charles Graux was born in Vervins, France. He studied for three years at the École pratique des hautes études from 1871 and became a teacher there in 1874. In 1881, he earned a doctorate for his work and was appointed to a teaching position at the Sorbonne. He was an editor for several leading journals. With funding from the French government, he made his first ‘scientific mission’ to Spain in 1875-6 to study and catalog the Greek manuscripts in the national collections. He was received by the Spanish king and visited 60 libraries. He 'discovered' or at least brought to the attention of modern scholars some 450 Greek manuscripts. He later traveled to Sweden and Denmark and made two more voyages to Spain. On a trip to Italy, he apparently contracted typhoid fever and died in Paris at the age of 29."

In January 1956, as chairman of the city carnival committee, Seppala banned bathing suits from the Fort William carnival queen contest in favour of skating skirts and sweaters.

Though he had learned some swordfighting and bullfighting skills in Spain before his arrival in the United States, he was a poor fighter. In 1903, he suffered an attack of nerves before a fight in Mexico and failed to fight. In 1904, he was a key figure in the St. Louis bullfight riot, which led to the destruction of a 14,000-seat arena by fire. Three days after the riot, he shot and killed fellow matador Don Manuel Cervera after the other man attacked Bass with a knife over a dispute regarding the bullfight canceled by the riot. A subsequent coroner's inquest found Bass acted in self-defense and should not be charged with murder. Following his acquittal, Bass went on to star in several bloodless bullfights. These involved enraging the bull, causing it to charge and miss, but not spearing it or cutting it with a sword."

  "text" : "Carl Anton Joseph Maria Dominikus Baumstark (4 August 1872, Konstanz – 31 May 1948, Bonn) was a German Orientalist, philologist and liturgist. His main area of study was Oriental liturgical history, its development and its influence on literature, culture and art. His grandfather, Anton Baumstark (1800–1876), was a noted philologist. He studied classical and Oriental philology, obtaining his habilitation for both subjects in 1898 at Heidelberg. In 1899, he relocated to Rome, where in 1901, he became an editor of the academic journal Oriens Christianus. Later on, he worked for 15 years as an instructor at a Roman Catholic secondary school in Sasbach, Baden. In 1921 he became an honorary professor in Bonn, then served as a professor of Semitic studies and comparative liturgal science at Nijmegen (from 1923), followed by a professorship of Arabic and Islamic studies at the University of Utrecht (from 1926). From 1930 to 1935, he was a professor of Oriental studies at the University of Münster."

After holding several jobs and marrying, Gilbert turned to songwriting with Gamble and Huff and penned the lyrics for Billy Paul's hit \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" in 1972. He also wrote the lyrics for \"Don't Leave Me This Way,\" originally a track on Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes' 1975 album Wake Up Everybody and later an international hit for Thelma Houston, whose version was nominated for Best R&B Song at the 1978 Grammy Awards. Gilbert also co-wrote \"Livin' for the Weekend\" and \"Your Body's Here With Me (But Your Mind Is on the Other Side of Town)\" for The O'Jays, “Don’t Let the Music Slip Away” for Archie Bell & the Drells, and \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\" for the Philadelphia International All-Stars.

He followed the style of Paolo Veronese. He also painted for churches and palaces, but little of his painted work remains. He painted for the presbytery in Asiago. He painted portrait of Federico da Molin for the Audience Hall in the Palazzo Pretorio of Bassano. He painted altarpieces for the Cathedral and the chapel of Spirito Santo in the church of San Francisco in Bassano. His son, Marco, was also a painter. Pietro Menarola, an engraver, was also a member of his family. A Sacrifice of Iphigenia, attributed to Menarola is in display in the Pinacoteca of Palazzo Chiericati, Vicenza. Among his prints, is a Descent of the Holy Spirit, after a design of Jacopo Bassano."

He leads the heliophysics research group at the Boulder, Colorado offices of the Southwest Research Institute and holds an adjunct faculty position at the University of Colorado, Boulder. His wide-ranging contributions to the field of experimental astrophysics of the Sun include: early work on the MSSTA, a sounding rocket that prototyped modern normal-incidence EUV optics such as are used on the Solar Dynamics Observatory; his discovery of sound waves in the solar corona in 1998; standardization of computer vision techniques that are used to measure and track magnetic fields on the solar surface; co-invention with colleague Charles Kankelborg of the fluxon semi-Lagrangian approach to numerical MHD modeling; and pioneering work on quantitative remote sensing of the solar wind via Thomson scattered light. DeForest is noted outside the heliophysics science community for his contributions to open-source software, in particular PDL and Audacity; and for his extensive work on science outreach to the public. He was the Press Officer of the American Astronomical Society's Solar Physics Division from 1999 to 2016, when he stepped down, to be replaced by Henry \"Trae\" Winter."

Born to a Thuringian family in Ebeleben, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen , Gerber studied law in Jena and taught it in Erlangen after 1847, in Jena in 1862 and in Leipzig after 1863. He is often mentioned as a leading scholar of civil law together with his friend Rudolf von Jhering, and his views also helped shape the development of constitutional law in Germany. In 1867, he was elected to the North German Reichstag, and became North German minister of culture in 1871. He held that post until in 1891, shortly before his death, he was appointed chief minister of the Saxon government. Gerber married Rosalie von Bloedau in 1848, with whom he had three children. After her death in 1859, he married her sister Helene von Bloedau, with whom he had two children."

  "text" : "Charlo Greene  (born Charlene Egbe) is an American businesswoman and former reporter/anchor for KTVA in Anchorage, Alaska. Greene received media notice after she quit her job on-air while covering a story on the Alaska Cannabis Club, a medical marijuana organization in Alaska. In the news spot Greene revealed that she was the business owner of the club and used profanity after explaining that she was quitting in order to devote more time to advocate for marijuana reform in Alaska. The resulting video went viral and has raised some criticism over Greene's conflict of interest as she had reported on her own business. On October 16, 2014 High Times awarded Greene its Courage in Media Award at their 40th anniversary party in New York. Elle has also listed Greene as one of the \"13 Most Potent Women in the Pot Industry\" in October 2014. After quitting Greene opened an IndieGoGo campaign to raise funds for marijuana reform and has raised over $11,000. In November 2014 the Alaska Public Offices Commission served Greene with a subpoena, alleging that she had violated campaign finance disclosure laws regarding Alaska Measure 2 (2014), a measure that would legalize recreational marijuana use in Alaska. Greene objected to the subpoena stating that the funding was to be used toward worldwide marijuana advocacy and was not specifically earmarked for Ballot Measure 2. The commission rejected the subpoena noting that while Greene's organization did not appear to violate campaign disclosure laws she must still comply with the ongoing investigation. In January 2015 Greene and the Alaska Cannabis Club were evicted from a building they had been renting, a former Kodiak Bar and Grill location in Anchorage, for failing to obtain insurance in a timely manner."

She has won a number of prizes including the CNRS medal for Young Researcher and the Ancel prize of the French Physical Society. She was recently elected fellow of the American Physical Society. Berger took as the subject of her PhD the electronic properties of AIMn quasicrystals. She gained her doctorate at the University of Grenoble, France, making hers the first thesis in France on quasicrystals (crystals declared non-existent by orthodoxies of 20th century science.) Having studied and produced amorphous films in a postdoctoral position at the Centre D'Etudes Atomiques, she was hired as a researcher at the CNRS's Laboratory for Study of Electronic Properties of Solids (LEPES), where she contributed to the experimental evidence for a metal-insulator transition in the compound quasicrystalline materials grown and characterised at LEPES. She is notable for her co-authorship of the first article demonstrating the two dimensional properties of graphene and for proposing the use of graphene in electronics. Together with Walt de Heer and Phil First she co-authored the first patent for graphene electronics in 2003. Her current scientific interests are primarily in the field of nano science and the electronic property of graphene-based systems."

  "text" : "Corey Blake is an entrepreneur, storyteller and former actor and filmmaker. He has released graphic novel translations of popular book titles. Blake founded and ran the nonprofit organization known as The From the Barrio Foundation, which \"committed to using author Robert Renteria’s life, business experience, and role as a civic leader to help eliminate conditions that foster violence, delinquency, drugs, and gangs.\" In order to produce his comic books, Blake has established a publishing house, based in Highland Park, Illinois known as Writers of the Round Table Press, which has produced renditions of The Long Tail and The Art of War, among others, including Shut Up, Stop Whining, & Get a Life, Overachievement, How to Master the Art of Selling and Mi Barrio. These books are widely used in the educational sector, as well as in youth prisons. The authors of these books \"all agreed to exchange rights for a token $100 each, in return for royalty payments of as much as 20% of Round Table’s take\", according to Forbes. The comic book versions of the titles are available at major bookstores such as Barnes & Noble, Indigo Books and Music; the publications are also released in digital format, for devices such as iPhones, as well as BlackBerry and Android devices. Blake's motivation for format translation stems from his interest in attracting busy professionals and a new generation of readers who prefer to be entertained as they are educated. In the education sector, Corey Blake has organized the delineation of the United States Constitution, as well as its ratification process in a work titled United States Constitution: A Graphic Adaptation. Kate Kelly noted that in the text, Blake's company \"included women as part of the process that looks to the future. A female in period clothes is used to depict several of the explanations concerning the power of the Constitution, and women are represented in the sections that address Congress and its responsibilities. In May 2013, Corey Blake has also launched the production of a publication, aimed at the fifth grade standard, known as The Crusaders, a \"comic that use[d] real-life authors as super heroes to help kids face challenges.\" Blake has also pictorialized the story of Riley Weinstein, a teenage girl who has \"survived nearly 20 brain surgeries, five strokes and paralysis.\" Prior to his work in publishing, Blake was an actor who costarred and guest starred on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Shield, Fastlane, and Joan of Arcadia among other shows. Short Films he produced and directed won awards at the San Diego Film Festival, Worldfest Houston, and the George Sidney Independent Film Competition. He starred in commercials for Mountain Dew, Mitsubishi, and American Express, among others. His appearance in “Coverage” for Yard Fitness earned producers a Belding, Bronze Lion, London International Advertising Award, and an Adforum Creative Hit Award; the commercial was featured on ABC’s “World’s Greatest Commercials.”"

  "text" : "Clifford Y. Stephens (1891 – April 1971) was the owner of High's Dairy Store. Stephens started out as a farmer and dairyman. He went to Iowa State and graduated in 1925 working locally. Later he worked for Pet in Greensboro North Carolina. At the peak of the depression in 1933, he bought controlling interest in the Washington based High's Dairy Products Corporation. With a $1,800 loan he operated ten ice cream stores and a plant at 1326 Half street SE in Washington. In 1941, Stephens took over as sole owner of the High's Dairy Store Corporation. Stephens opened plants in Washington and Frederick to process milk. The Frederick plant opened in 1959 with a production capacity of 100,000 gallons daily. He became active in politics regarding milk cooperatives, creating \"Marylander for Milk Freedom\" in 1959 to oppose price controls on state milk production. In 1961, Stephens created the East Coast Ice Cream Novelty Company which constructed a large Ice cream manufacturing plant on Whiskey Bottom Road. The plant in later years would be expanded to become the second largest Ice cream plant on the east coast, operated by Nestle, with the offices later becoming the Phillips School for students with youth with cognitive, emotional, social learning or behavioral challenges. Stephens became a trustee of Hood College in Frederick and Glenelg Country School. In 1962, Stephens donated all of his stock to his alma matter, the Campus of Iowa State University which in turn named a auditorium after him. The Capitol Milk Producers of Frederick repurchased the stock, retaining Stephens as president. In 1962, Senator Frank E. Shipley bypassed the state school board nominating commission recommendation of Fred Schoenbrodt, and installed C.Y. Stephens.In October 1963, Stephens was indicted with multiple milk producers for price fixing between 1956 and 1960. A month later, Stephens died outside of Annapolis, Maryland colliding his car with another on the Severn River Bride on 29 November 1963. \n* Stephens Road in North Laurel is named after C.Y. Stephens"

  "text" : "Charles Harry (or Henry) Moline (June 1863 – 23 May 1927) was an Anglo-Austrian businessman and a cricketer who played in two first-class cricket matches for Cambridge University in 1886. Moline was born in Ljubljana, then called Laibach and at that stage in the Austrian Empire, but now in Slovenia; he died in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England. His precise date of birth is not known. Charles Moline was the son of an English father who was a businessman who set up sugar refining factories in Ljubljana and married a local woman, Emma Kranz, in 1852. The family returned to England in the mid-1860s to live in Bristol where they had sugar refining interests, and Charles was educated at Bristol Grammar School and at Jesus College, Cambridge. Moline had two matches for the University team as a right-handed tail-end batsman and a right-arm slow bowler: in the first he made 16 out of a last-wicket partnership of 40 that took Cambridge's total to 84, and also took his only first-class wicket, but he was not successful in the second game and did not appear again. He played club cricket for Clifton Cricket Club alongside his brothers, Edgar, who also played two first-class matches for Gloucestershire, and Frank. There is no record that Moline took a degree at Cambridge University; he went into business in the family sugar refinery trade."

  "text" : "Carmen Segarra was a US New York Federal Reserve–appointed regulator to Goldman Sachs for seven months from October 2011. She discovered that Goldman Sachs did not have any policy on conflict of interest when it advised El Paso Corporation on selling itself to Kinder Morgan, a company in which Goldman Sachs owned a US$4 billion stake, and with several former Goldman Sachs employees who had previously worked for Kinder Morgan on the El Paso team. She was pressured by her superiors at the Federal Reserve to alter her report, but stated that her professional view of the situation did not change, and refused to do so. She was dismissed shortly after. Segarra filed suit against the Federal Reserve in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that she was terminated due to reporting to her superiors that the Goldman Sachs Group did not have a firmwide conflict-of-interest policy. Segarra alleged that her termination violated the whistleblower protection provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1831j. Also included as defendants were Jonathan Kim, Segarra's supervisor, and two employees who were responsible for managing the relationship between Goldman and the Federal Reserve. The case was dismissed because Segarra \"failed to allege that she was terminated because she 'reported' violations of anything other than SR 08-08.\" (Emphasis in original.) Because SR 08-08 is an advisory letter and does not carry the force of law, the court found, an allegation that she was fired for reporting its violation did not entitle Segarra to bring a claim under the whistleblower protection provision of 12 U.S.C. § 1831j. Segarra also brought several state law claims, but the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the claims once it found that there could be no claim under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Segarra appealed the district court's dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in May 2014. Her brief was filed on December 9, 2014, and defendant-appellees reply brief is due December 30, 2014. After her dismissal, Segarra in September 2014 released audio recordings about another issue in which the Federal Reserve did not properly regulate Goldman Sachs. After the European Banking Authority required European banks to increase their capital holdings to make them more robust to shocks, Spanish Santander Bank arranged for Goldman to hold some of its shares in its Brazilian subsidiary for some years, for a payment of about $40 million, a practice that was considered by Federal Reserve to be \"legal but shady.\" Segarra said that she had pointed out that there was a requirement, which was not followed, for Goldman to check that the FR had no objection to the terms. Opinions were published about the ineffectual behaviour of a government agency supposed to hold to account an organisation, rather than make minor criticism but take no action on being presented with disturbing or threatening information. Excerpts of the recordings were featured in a lengthy report on the radio show This American Life."

  "text" : "Clarence Kolster was an American film editor, active during the later years of the silent era, right through the 1950s. Born in Plattsburgh, New York in 1895, he would begin his film career editing the 1922 silent film, Rags to Riches. In the more than thirty years of his career, he would edit almost 100 films, as well as his sole directing foray, as the assistant on the 1924 silent film, The Lighthouse by the Sea. His career would include such classics as The Painted Desert, also in 1931, which featured Clark Gable's first speaking role; the 1946 remake of Of Human Bondage; Always Leave Them Laughing, starring Milton Berle and Virginia Mayo; and 1958's Our Miss Brooks starring Eve Arden. But Kolster's crowning achievement was his first mega-hit, the 1931 version of Frankenstein, starring Boris Karloff. Kolster's editing of when the monster is revealed has been called, \"... possibly the most distinguished piece of cutting in all of horror movie history.\" In addition, the creation sequence, the monster finding the small child by the lake, and the confrontation between the monster and Frankenstein's bride, have all become iconic scenes in film history, often imitated and parodied in later pictures. In 1958, Kolster would make the switch from the big screen to the small screen, where he worked on several television series, including Maverick and 77 Sunset Strip. Kolster retired in 1962, and would die ten years later."

She launched the charity Neighbours in Poplar in 1968, to help older adults meet up and enjoy outings, and later South Poplar and Limehouse Action for Secure Housing (SPLASH), showing similar concern for teenagers. She is known locally for distributing Christmas meals to elderly and lonely people. In 2010 she led a public protest against rigid restrictions introduced by Tower Hamlets Council in the name of safety following a tower block fire in south London. On 8 August 2014, Frost removed an emblem resembling the Black Standard from the entrance to a Council estate in Poplar, as the local authority had been slow to react. She explained that the protesters had intended to express solidarity with Gaza, but had been unaware that other residents would be intimidated."

Before moving to California, Dr. Rowell was a Union soldier in the Civil War. He took part in several battles between 1861 and 1864, including the Battle of Shiloh and the Siege of Vicksburg. Dr. Rowell arrived in Fresno in 1874 to practice medicine. In September 1876, he established the Fresno Republican newspaper. It was purchased by and eventually merged into the present-day Fresno Bee. In 1879 he was elected to the state senate in California as a Republican. The county was heavily Democratic at the time, and Rowell was the first Republican to win an election in Fresno County. In 1912 he received an overwhelming share of the vote to win the mayoral election. Rowell commissioned the construction of Fresno's first skyscraper, now known as the Rowell building. It is six stories tall and located in downtown Fresno at the southeast corner of Tulare and Van Ness streets. In 1914, Fresno commissioned Haig Patigian to create a memorial sculpture. The base of the memorial contains a relief where Rowell is shown seated at a patient's bedside. It can be found in the Fresno County Courthouse park, across the street from the Rowell family home in downtown Fresno."

She was the partner of artist Christian Boltanski. In 2005, her work was featured in the French Pavilion of the Venice Biennale, where she won the Golden Lion for her Pinocchio-inspired installation that transformed the French pavilion into a casino. One of her most famous pieces is her exhibition The Messengers (Mori Art Museum in Tokyo), which showcases a series of toy-like, hand knit animals in costumes. For example, some of the animals' heads were replaced by heads of other stuffed animals to reflect the ways in which humans disguise themselves or transform their identities with costume. She had a solo exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou in 2007. Her work is held in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. In 2006, a book under the title Word for Word: Texts, Writings and Interviews (1971–2005) was published. It explores the writing in Annette Messager's artworks and gathers numerous related texts published in magazines or catalogues, as well as unpublished notes on Messager's work and her personal reflections on art and life. All her interviews from 1974 to the present are also included."

  "text" : "Charles Morse (20 August 1820 – 25 March 1883) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, the Marylebone Cricket Club, the All-England team and other amateur teams between 1842 and 1862. He was born in Norwich, Norfolk and died at Dresden in Germany. Morse was educated at Dedham, Essex and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He played cricket as a lower-order right-handed batsman for the Cambridge University side from 1842 to 1844 and appeared in the University Match against Oxford University in all three seasons. But his only innings of note in this period was a score of 82 made for the MCC against Cambridge University in 1844; this proved to be his highest first-class score and his only score over 50 in a 20-year cricket career spanning 40 first-class games. A contemporary report described his innings: \"Mr. Morse played with caution, and now and then indulged in a severity of hitting which was really cricket.\" Morse graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1844 and then was admitted to the Inner Temple; he was called to the bar in 1848 but never practised as a barrister. Instead he settled at Aylsham and became a Justice of the Peace and deputy lieutenant of Norfolk. This career enabled him to continue to play cricket fairly frequently through to his 40s, though rarely did he make much impact as a batsman, and he did not bowl in major matches. In 1849, for example, he was a member of a very strong \"England\" side (the All-England Eleven) in a game against Surrey, playing alongside John Wisden, Alfred Mynn, Fuller Pilch and Jemmy Dean."

He should not be confused with Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers, who was an actor and film producer, as well as being married to Mary Pickford. Rogers began his career on the 1924 silent film, A Cafe in Cairo, produced by the short-lived Hunt Stromberg Productions. After Stromberg ceased productions in 1925, Rogers would found his own independent company, Charles R. Rogers Productions. He would also produce for major studios such as RKO Radio Pictures, Universal, and United Artists. The pinnacle of his career would be from 1936 to 1938 when he was chosen as the vice-president in charge of production for Universal Pictures. He died as the result of injuries sustained in a car accident in 1957."

  "text" : "Carmelita Pope (born April 15, 1924, in Chicago, Illinois) is an American stage, film, and television actor. Pope became friends with another aspiring actor, Jocelyn Brando, and also became friends with her brother, Marlon Brando. The two developed a close bond. Brando frequently stayed at Pope's home, where they played bocce ball together. Pope's break as an actor came when she was cast by George Abbott as the lead, Corliss Archer, first as a replacement in the Chicago cast  and subsequently in the U.S.O. production of his play Kiss and Tell that was to tour Italy and Northern Africa in 1945. Upon her return stateside, Pope replaced Cecily De Lucas in the role of Daisy Belle in the comedy Maid in the Ozarks at the Belasco Theatre on Broadway It was Pope's performance as anointed saint Mother Cabrini in the 1947 film Citizen Saint (under her stage name, Carla Dare) that drew the attention of director Elia Kazan. He subsequently cast her as Kim Hunter's understudy in the Broadway production of A Streetcar Named Desire. She was reunited with childhood friend Marlon Brando, who was playing Stanley. After the announcement that a large portion of the original cast (including Kim Hunter) would be leaving A Streetcar Named Desire in 1949, the producers put out a casting call for actors to replace them. Hunter, who had never missed a performance, told Pope that she would fake an illness and miss a day so that Pope could perform for the producers. Surprising even Pope herself, Hunter did call out sick one day, and Pope went on. She signed her contract to play Stella the next day. Pope remained with the production until it closed. Pope married Chicago ad man Howard Charles Ballenger II in April 1949, and the pair moved to Chicago, where they raised two sons. She starred as a panelist on the television show Down You Go in the 1950s, did numerous radio spots, and was also the spokeswoman for Pam Cooking Spray. Following the death of her husband in 1986, Pope moved to Los Angeles, where she served as the director of the Hollywood office of the American Humane Association. She remarried in 1988 and retired to Stuart, Florida. Pope now lives in Boise, Idaho, where she volunteers at the Warhawk Air Museum."
