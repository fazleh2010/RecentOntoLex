  "text" : "Don Sherwood, a native of rural New York, turned a childhood love of drawing into a six-decade career as a cartoonist and illustrator. Born on September 12, 1930, Sherwood quickly was enthralled by radio and movie entertainment, and the adventures of heroes such as the Lone Ranger and Hopalong Cassidy fueled his artistic imagination. As a teenager, Sherwood sent samples of his art to Chester Gould, the creator of Dick Tracy. Gould was impressed and wrote back, telling Sherwood that he had talent and encouraging him to move to Gould's city of Chicago to study the craft. Sherwood took the advice, leaving high school and enrolling at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. While in Chicago, Sherwood visited Gould regularly to observe his cartooning habits and worked as a copy boy at the Chicago Daily News. Also at that time, Sherwood enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves. He was called into active duty and fought with the First Marine Division in the Korean War, spending 18 months in combat operations in the Korean mountainside. The experience had a transformative effect on Sherwood, who developed a deep respect and appreciation for the Corps and its values. Upon returning to the United States, Sherwood moved to New York and resumed his young cartooning career by working as a bylined staff artist for the New York Mirror, as an illustrator on the comic strips Cotton Woods and Will Chance, and then as an assistant for George Wunder on the adventure strip Terry and the Pirates. However, he longed to create a strip of his own and to showcase the bravery of the United States Marines. In 1963, at the age of 32, Sherwood did just that, launching Dan Flagg. The strip, featuring a Marine hero, was an instant success, appearing in 400 newspapers and in most major metropolitan markets, including the New York Daily News, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Post. The creation of Dan Flagg launched Sherwood forward in his profession. He was invited to lunch with President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House, joining four other famed military cartoonists (Milton Caniff, Mort Walker, Bill Mauldin and George Wunder). He was a presenter at the 1964 World's Fair in New York, and \"Dan Flagg Day\" ceremonies were held in New York City and Philadelphia. Sherwood researched his strip exhaustively, visiting Marine installations, talking to recruits and generals, and studying the Corps and the subjects of planned storylines. As a result, Sherwood was commended for the authenticity of his artwork (after one strip contained a drawing of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India, Sherwood received a letter from the architect of the building, Edward Durell Stone, praising its accuracy) and for the timeliness of his storylines (after one adventure involving Cuban relations, a group seeking to oust Fidel Castro wrote to Sherwood to ask for Dan Flagg's cooperation). Sherwood consistently appeared on behalf of the Marine Corps, with whom he shared a mutual respect; the Marine Corps Commandant, David Shoup, met with Sherwood and called him \"a master of his art.\" As Dan Flagg continued to establish its place in newspapers in the mid-1960s, Sherwood was approached by Universal Studios about having the Marine hero appear in another medium—television. Sherwood had modeled Dan Flagg after his movie hero, Robert Taylor. Taylor agreed to star as Dan Flagg in the proposed television series and visited Sherwood at his home in Oneonta, New York, appearing at the city's \"Dan Flagg Day\" ceremony. However, with war escalating in Vietnam, public sentiment for military-themed entertainment was turning. A Dan Flagg television deal was not finalized, and the Marine legend retired from active duty."

  "text" : "David Alan Grier is a writer active in the field of technology and social policy. He is associate professor of international science and technology policy and international affairs at George Washington University. As a professor, his area of expertise includes globalization, international standardization, scientific institutions, and the history of science. Publications include The Company We Keep. He writes the column Errant Hashtag for the IEEE magazine Computer. A series of podcasts also entitled \"Errant Hashtag\" discusses the correlation of technology, management, organization, and the society at large. He also writes the monthly column \"CS David\" for the Communications of the Chinese Computing Federation. He is also the Executive Producer and Chief Writer of the weekly podcast \"How We Manage Stuff.\" Backed by a team of talented actors, the podcast attempts to take an insightful and yet humorous look at the issues of technology, organization, innovation, work, and creativity. It is co-hosted by Tamara Carleton of the Innovation Board. Grier is considered an expert on the concept of crowdsourcing and the future of the work force on an international scale. His book When Computers Were Human explored early want of using massed labor to process data and showed that most of the ideas of crowdsourcing predated the internet. The book focussed on on the story of the Mathematical Tables Project, which was a New Deal agency that hired unemployed clerks and laborers to calculate higher mathematical functions. Between 2009 and 2011, he prepared a series of podcasts on the organization and operation of crowdsourcing. These podcasts were eventually published as the book Crowdsourcing for Dummies. In 2013, he was made a Fellow of the IEEE for his contributions to the field of Crowdsourcing. He is also the technology principal for the Washington-based consulting firm Djaghe, LLC, alongside his wife, Jean Heilman Grier. Djaghe, LLC works with clients in the United States along with Asia, Europe and South America, on topics dealing dealing with technology and trade issues. He is also a member of the Institute for International Science & Technology Policy of the George Washington University. At the University, he served as Director of University Honors, Assistant Dean of Engineering and Associate Dean of INternational Affairs. He was the recipient of the 2009 George Washington Award for Contributions to the University and was the 2013 President of the Computer Society of the IEEE. Grier was raised in Detroit, contemporaneously with the actor David Alan Grier. As a teenager, he worked for Oldsmobile and Burroughs Computer Corporation, where he learned to program. He attended Middlebury College in Vermont, where he studied with the writers Barry Hannah and Tom Gavin, and he spent most of his spare time in the computer center writing a word processor, though he was nominally a mathematics major. He then worked on the Burroughs Scientific Processor Project in Paoli, Pennsylvania. He attended the University of Washington in Seattle, where he received a doctorate in Mathematical Statistics even though he spent much of his spare time doing amateur improv. His breakthrough article was a piece on how the 1989 protestors at Tiananmen Square used the precursor of the Internet to rally their supporters in North America."

  "text" : "Dwight Essler Bentel PhD (April 15, 1909 Walla Walla, Washington - May 16, 2012 Saratoga, California) was a journalist and professor. He has been called \"the father of journalism\" at San Jose State University. In 1934, he founded the Spartan Daily, the campus newspaper. In 1936, he founded the School of Journalism and Mass Communications, which has produced six Pulitzer Prize winners and thousands of journalists, and is one of the largest programs of its kind in the nation. The school renamed the building that houses the school \"Dwight Bentel Hall\" in 1982. Subsequently, the on campus advertising agency has been named Dwight, Bentel and Hall Communications. \"You were just determined to be as good as you could because you knew that was what Dwight expected of you,\"— Professor Emeritus Gordon Greb, Bentel started as a reporter for the San Jose Mercury Herald, in the lineage of the San Jose Mercury News in 1928. At the time the paper was engaged in a Prohibition era campaign to eliminate Speakeasys from San Jose. His first day on the job, editor Merle Gray handed Bentel a Spanish American War era Colt .45 revolver for his protection. He was thought to be the oldest living former member of the San Jose Mercury News staff. He also worked for the Associated Press and the San Francisco Call-Bulletin. Bentel began his collegiate education at San Jose State College also in 1928, before moving to Stanford University where he earned his B.A. in 1932 and masters in 1934. Shortly after that he was hired by President T.W. MacQuarrie. His short conversation was: \"Dwight, I would like you to possibly do a little publicity with the college, to teach some basic course or two in journalism and … Dwight, I don’t really know what your job is.\" That led to the eventual establishment of the School of Journalism. Working on his own, he established the volunteer run State College Times into a professionally run daily student newspaper. \"Beginning immediately, you are now on a standard three-unit performance — three units of payment as a requirement — and you do not come wandering in when you are ready to work. You are to come in at 1 in the afternoon and work until 4. Whether you have a story due, you come in at 1. At that time we did a review of that day’s paper and saw what was good. But it was no longer a choice of you to say whether you would come in and work.”“Who said we could give three units of credit? I did. Later I had a word with the administration.”— Bentel, \"(The department) was his child. Dwight, until his last breath, was all about the importance of words and communication. His legacy is that there's power in that and there's power in what we do -- and with power comes responsibility.\"— Valerie Coleman Morris, Emmy award- winning ex-CNN anchor, During World War II, Bentel left the department in the hands of Dolores Freitas Spurgeon, while he worked as a war news writer in New York City. He studied at Columbia University, eventually earning his doctoral degree. Meanwhile Spurgeon kept the Spartan Daily alive by printing on a Mimeograph while newsprint was in short supply. The program grew to one of the largest in the country, including specialties in advertising, public relations, photojournalism and radio and television broadcasting. The department was one of the first to require internships for graduation. Bentel was a staunch defender of the First Amendment, reminding students from the first day: \"Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of the press. Congress was making no law when the executive branch imposed bureaucratic secrecy, he would explain, or when the judicial branch issued contempt citations to reporters protecting confidential news sources. The only guarantees, he would add, were the public's insistence that no one intrude on its right to know and the determination by the news media to fight for that right. Truth is an absolute defense! Bentel wrote a column for Editor and Publisher, plus wrote Stories of Santa Clara Valley, co-authored by Freitas Spurgeon and jointly authored The Encyclopedia of Photography; the Complete Photographer; the Comprehensive Guide and Reference for All Photographers."

  "text" : "David William Boyd (born 17 September 1941) is a Canadian mathematician who does research on harmonic and classical analysis, inequalities related to geometry, number theory, and polynomial factorization, sphere packing, number theory involving Diophantine approximation and Mahler's measure, and computer computations. Boyd received in 1963 his B.Sc. with Honours from Carleton University, then in 1964 his M.A. and in 1966 his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto under Paul George Rooney with thesis The Hilbert transformation on rearrangement invariant Banach spaces. Boyd became in 1966–67 an assistant professor at the University of Alberta, in 1967–70 an assistant professor and in 1970–71 an associate professor at the California Institute of Technology, and in 1971–74 an associate professor, in 1974–2007 a professor, and since 2007 a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia. Boyd has done research on classical and harmonic analysis, including interpolation spaces, integral transforms, and potential theory, and research on inequalities involving geometry, number theory, polynomials, and applications to polynomial factorization. He has also worked, especially in the 1970s, on sphere packing, in particular, Apollonian packing and limit sets of Kleinian groups. Boyd has studied number theory, such as diophantine approximation, the Pisot and Salem numbers, Pisot sequences, Mahler’s measure, applications to symbolic dynamics, and special values of L-functions and polylogarithms. He is also interested in mathematical computation, including numerical analysis, symbolic computation, and computational number theory, and also geometric topology, including hyperbolic manifolds and computation of invariants. His doctoral students include Peter Borwein, Michael Bennett, Nathan Ng, and Mathew Rogers."

He worked in the field of agricultural administration before going into politics. Representing the centre-left National United Party, he was first elected to the Parliament of Vanuatu as MP for Pentecost Island in the 2002 general election. He retained his seat in 2004, 2008 and 2012. In April 2012, he crossed the floor to the People’s Progressive Party, led by the then Prime Minister Sato Kilman. In March 2014, Kilman resigned, no longer having the support of a majority in Parliament. New Prime Minister Moana Carcasses Kalosil (of the Green Confederation) appointed Tosul as his Minister for Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries and Biosecurity. In September 2013, Tosul joined Ralph Regenvanu's Land and Justice Party. With Regenvanu, he crossed the floor on 15 May 2014 to help bring down the Carcasses government. New Prime Minister Joe Natuman maintained Tosul at his post as Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. He lost office on 11 June 2015 when the Natuman government was ousted in a motion of no confidence."

Carpenter, 1899-1985, was an American businessman who served as the first civilian Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, Deputy to United States Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal on atomic energy matters, and Chairman of the U.S. Munitions Board. In 1922, Carpenter graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree and entered industry, rising through key managerial positions with the Dupont Viscoloid Company from 1927 through 1933, and the Remington Arms Company from 1933 through 1947. As vice president and assistant general manager of the Remington Arms Company during World War II, he guided the company's expansion to meet the Allied Forces' ammunition needs. In 1947 he was appointed a member of the Industrial Advisory Group to the Atomic Energy Commission, where he advocated wider industrial participation in the developing atomic energy enterprise. In 1948 he was appointed by U.S. President Harry S. Truman as the first civilian chairman of the Military Liaison Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he strengthened the committee status as a civilian-military enterprise inclusive of Army, Navy and Air Force nuclear activities. Later in 1948 Carpenter was appointed by Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal as his deputy \"in atomic energy matters\". In 1948 Carpenter was appointed by President Truman to be the Chairman of the national Munitions Board, established by the National Security Act of 1947 to coordinate industrial matters affecting the National Military Establishment, including procurement, production, and distribution functions. His work as chairman was recognized with letters of appreciation from James Forrestal, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Carpenter returned to DuPont as General Manager of the Film Department in 1949, and worked there until his retirement in 1963. The Donald F. Carpenter Collection at the Hagley Museum and Library documents his life and career through photographs, newspaper clippings, magazine articles, pamphlets and letters."

  "text" : "Daniel-Maurice Godefroy de Linctot (baptized May 5, 1739 – died between January 18 and April 30, 1783) was a colonial army officer and merchant in Quebec and an Indian agent in the United States. The son of Louis-René Godefroy de Linctot and Catherine-Apolline Blondeau, he joined the army of New France as a cadet, becoming an ensign in 1759. After the French defeat, Linctot and his family went to France, arriving in January 1762. He returned to North America and became a trader in the Illinois Country. Although he originally was considered a British supporter, Linctot joined the American militia in July 1778. He led a unit of horse soldiers in attacks against Peouarea, Vincennes and Ouiatanon. In 1779, he was named Indian agent by George Rogers Clark; the commission was confirmed by Virginia governor Thomas Jefferson the following year. Linctot helped recruit members of the Shawnees, Delawares and other tribes in the Ohio Valley to the American cause. In 1782, Virginia governor Benjamin Harrison wrote to the Virginia delegates in Congress regarding unpaid salary and expenses for Linctot. He died in the Illinois Country sometime during the following year."

  "text" : "Dina Abramowicz (1909-2000) was a librarian at YIVO and a Yiddish language expert. Abramowicz was born in Vilnius, then under Russian rule. Her parents were teachers. Though her first language was Russian, when the Germans occupied Vilnius during World War I, they allowed Jews to establish their own schools. Abramowicz's parents sent her to a Yiddish-language elementary and high schools. During her university years she studied Polish literature. Her first job was at a children's library in Vilnius, the Kinderbibliotek. Soon after its founding she joined YIVO. During World War II, Vilnius's Jews were put in ghettos. A librarian, Herman Kruk, organized a library and asked Abramowicz to staff it. \"How can we think of a library under these conditions, and who will come to read books there?\" she remembered asking a fellow librarian. \"Since there was nothing one could do about this absurd situation, what was the use of talking and wondering?\" was the response. During its initial year, the ghetto library lent 100,000 books, mostly of escapist fiction to relieve the suffering of the ghetto residents. The Vilnius ghetto was liquidated in 1943. Abramowicz's mother was sent to Treblinka where she was murdered. Abramowicz was to be sent to a labor camp, but when the train car door opened on the Vilnius platform, she walked out unnoticed and made her escape, eventually working in a camp devoted to processing winter coats for the German army. She escaped into the woods and joined Jewish resistance fighters as a nurse's helper. After the war she made her way to New York City where she reunited with her father (who had relocated there prior to the war). There she encountered Max Weinreich, one of YIVO's founders, and together they worked to reconstitute YIVO. She became the head librarian at YIVO in 1962, a position she held until 1987, when she was appointed research librarian, a position she held until her death. People recalled Abramowicz as having a phenomenal memory and as being a knowledgeable source for information on the Yiddish culture of Eastern Europe."

  "text" : "Davidson Garrett (born September 11, 1952), a.k.a. King Lear of the Taxi, is an American poet and actor, living in Manhattan, who has worked as a New York City yellow taxi cab driver, since the 1970s, to support his acting and writing pursuits. Garrett is the author of several books of poetry. A recent chapbook titled To Tell The Truth I Wanted To Be Kitty Carlisle and Other Poems was published by Finishing Line Press in 2013. King Lear of the Taxi: Musings of a New York City Actor/Taxi Driver, the poet's first full-length collection, was published by Advent Purple Press in 2006. An earlier chapbook manuscript, \"Taxi Dreams,\" was one of six finalists for the Gival Press Chapbook Award in 2000. Poems and other writings have appeared in The New York Times,Xavier Review, The Episcopal New Yorker, Marco Polo Arts Magazine, and Podium, the online literary journal of the 92nd Street Y Unterberg Poetry Center. His poetry has been anthologized in Beyond the Rift: Poets of the Palisades (The Poets Press, 2010) and in Pears, Prose and Poetry (Poets Wear Prada / Eggplant Press, 2011). Garrett caught the attention of the public eye after the 2006 publication of his book King Lear of the Taxi. Poems from Garrett's book were used as text in the short film Taxi Driver - King Lear of the Taxi by director Ray Andrew Wilkes of Flashgun Films, Keele, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, UK. Garrett provided the voice-over (recorded in a studio in NYC) to accompany footage of British cab drivers in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. The film was a response to media reports of increased violence against cab drivers in the West Midlands and was screened at London's Portobello Film Festival in 2008. In 2009 Garrett was featured in Amy Braunschweiger's book Taxi Confidential: Life, Death and 3 a.m. Revelations in New York City Cabs. In 2012, the same year Garrett was nominated for a Pushcart Prize, he was profiled in New York Magazine by the journalist Kate Lowenstein in her article titled \"I Drive A Taxi, But I Also ...\" In 2013 Garrett was invited to take part in a taxi drivers' writing workshop organized by the poet Mark Nowak and sponsored by the PEN World Voices Festival. He and two other members of the workshop read their taxi poems at \"Watching the Meter: Poetry from the Taxi Drivers Workshop\" at The Public Theater's Joe's Pub in New York City. In 2014, Garrett was once again invited by PEN International to read his taxi poems, at the festival's celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, an event which also featured United States Poet Laureate Natasha Trethewey. Also in June 2014, Garrett was awarded first place in the 2nd Annual Juanita Torrence-Thompson International Poetry Competition sponsored by Amulet Poetry Magazine. In 2015, Advent Purple Press published a new chapbook by Garrett titled Southern Low Protestant Departure: A Funeral Poem. The poem is a long narrative work, written in the verse form of tercets, which depicts a Protestant funeral in a small Southern town. Also in 2015, Garrett had a spoken-word play published titled Conspiracy Theory: The Mysterious Death of Dorothy Kilgallen. This play was published in Issue 8 of the performance art journal, Nerve Lantern. As a spoken word performance poet, Garrett has appeared in many venues throughout New York City. In 2009 and 2010 he performed in Joel Allegretti’s tribute to Leonard Cohen, You Know Who I Am, which was produced by Greenwich Village’s Cornelia Street Cafe. In 2013, he was invited to be a part of the Boog City Poet Theater Night which was part of the annual Boog City Music and Poetry Festival in the East Village. He performed a solo poetic monologue, King Lear of the Taxi, adapted from his poetry collection. Garrett was cast in the play, Ishtar Redux, by poet John J. Trause that was staged in 2013 at La MaMa Experimental Theatre in an evening of performance works produced by the journal, Nerve Lantern. In August 2015, he was invited back to the Boog City Poet Theatre Night to perform a new poetic monologue with incidental music titled Nine Meditations on the Nothingness of Now. He collaborated with the musician, Michael Skliar. A native of Shreveport, Louisiana, Davidson Garrett came to New York to pursue an acting career, studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and with Alice Spivak at the Herbert Berghof Studio in Greenwich Village. Davidson graduated from The City College of New York with an M.S. in Education. A member of SAG-AFTRA and Actors' Equity, he has worked since 1973 in theater, film and television."

  "text" : "Daniel Gérard Rouzier (b. Pétionville, 1960) is a Haitian tycoon. Rouzier runs several companies in different sectors in Haiti, including car dealers, and an electric power company; and is member of the executive board of a Haitian bank. Rouzier is member of the Haitian-American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM). Born into an elite mulatto family, Rouzier was alumnus of Saint-Louis de Gonzague, the most prestigious school in Haiti. His father, Gérard Rouzier, was a jurist, president of the Haitian Football Federation, Vice President of CONCACAF, and Minister of Sports and Youth in the dictatorship of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s. One of his siblings is the renowned pianist Fabrice Rouzier. Rouzier graduated from the management and accounting at Dartmouth College and Georgetown University in the United States. He is an avid football player and a bibliophile. Rouzier, who has authored three books, owns one of the most complete libraries of Haiti, and serves as a regular contributor to Haitian daily newspapers. Rouzier is a philanthropist, vice-president of the Haitian chapter of Food for the Poor and has provided food, housing, medical services, education to poor families within Haiti. Rouzier married Karine Abraham and had three children. On 2005, his wife was kidnapped and held for more than ten days; Abraham was released after the payment of a ransom and has lived abroad since then, in order to undergo therapy because of psychological problems due to this event. Rouzier was a supporter of the 2004 coup d’etat that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide for the second time, and accused him to be “one of the most violent rulers Haiti ever had,” and argued that Aristide’s “only intent seems to have only been to replace the dictators that preceded him rather than to promote real change in Haiti.” In 2010, he was appointed as Honorary Consul from Jamaica to Haiti. On 15 May 2011, he was appointed Prime Minister by President Michel Martelly the day after his inauguration, but the Chamber of Deputees of Haiti, dominated by the Opposition, rejected his nomination on 21 June 2011; President Martelly has expressed disappointment with the deputies, but he accepted it."

  "text" : "Douglas Gary Speck (October 16, 1947 - March 4, 2010) was a high school teacher and track and field enthusiast. He carried his love of the sport into becoming a major promoter and source of information.  Starting in 1968, he joined Doug Smith in the creation of the Arcadia Invitational. Speck oversaw the growth of the meet, from a local spectacle to the premiere in-season nationwide invitational now called the \"Home of national records.\" \"He was an innovator. He was thinking of things before others. He really helped in the explosion of our sport.\"— Rich Gonzalez From his office at Arcadia High School, Speck became the ultimate researcher of the best track athletes around the United States. In order to attract the best athletes to the Invitational, he had to know who they were, so Speck tracked performances and statistics, writing columns for running publications like California Track and Running News. In the infancy of the internet, he joined Gonzalez in starting a website providing the most in depth coverage of high school track and field athletes in California. Merging with John Dye's similar site in North Carolina, they created the nationwide Dyestat site self-described as \"The Internet Home of High School Track & Field.\" The California version was known as Dyestatcal. Speck's fountain of information was not limited to print. He was the P.A. announcer at many of the top high school track and field meets including the Sunkist Invitational, the National Scholastic Indoor Championships, the Foot Locker Cross Country Championships, the Junior National Championships and the series of championship meets that led to the CIF California State Meet. He worked on the advisory committees for the State Championships for both track and field and cross country. It has been suggested the enthusiasm he instilled in the crowd encouraged many national records to happen. Following his untimely death to brain cancer, the National Scholastic Athletics Foundation created an annual award \"The Doug Speck Award for Excellence & Innovation.\""

Hudson was born in Branford, Connecticut and lived there until the age four when his family moved to Goshen, Connecticut. He lived in Goshen for many years, owning a farm, marrying Anna Norton in 1783 and raising the oldest seven of their nine children there. In 1789, Hudson joined a group to purchase a parcel of land in the Connecticut Western Reserve. The following year, he left Goshen to survey the parcel and settle it as Hudson Township. Hudson traveled through the state of New York, west along Lake Erie and south along the Cuyahoga River to reach his land. At the settlement, Hudson and his men built a home and the township's population increased steadily over the next few decades. Hudson's wife and children eventually moved to the township, where they had two more children. Hudson cited religion as a major influence on his life. He died on March 17, 1836 at age 75."

The film eventually led to his brother's release from the mental institution. Halasz has won a number of awards throughout his career, most notably the Promax BDA awards for excellence in Marketing & Promotion.

  "text" : "David Lewis Davies (3 April 1906 – June 1974), was a Welsh stage and film actor. At 6' 4\" he was often cast as a heavy, police officer or in a military or authoritarian role, such as Mr. Arrow, the first mate and enforcer outwitted by Long John Silver in Disney's 1950 Treasure Island. Davies appeared mainly in British film and television programmes, and was in demand for films set in Wales, such as The Three Weird Sisters (1948), The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949), Tiger Bay (1959) and Only Two Can Play (1962)."

  "text" : "David Alan Laird is a professor at Iowa State University, Department of Agronomy, Ames, Iowa. Throughout his career as a soil scientist, he made many contributions to clay mineralogy, including developing a model describing the relationship between cation selectivity and the extent of crystalline swelling in expanding 2:1 phyllosilicates. Other work demonstrated the effects of ionic strength and cation charge on the breakup and formation of smectitic quasicrystals and the principle of cation demixing which lent great insight into understanding clay flocculation. Investigations in organic matter interactions with clay minerals led to the development of the idea of dual mode bonding in which amphipathic molecules interact with substrates by both hydrophobic-hydrophobic and hydrophilic-hydrophilic interactions. Laird et al. (2008) showed that smectites, a class of clay minerals found in soil, can adsorb tremendous amounts of organic materials and, hence, strongly influence the transport and bioavailability of organic materials including pesticides applied to the soil. In a study published in 2003, Gonzalez and Laird showed that new carbon derived from decomposing plant material tends to preferentially sorb to the fine clay subfraction of soil. Further work demonstrated that the coarse clay fraction had the greatest carbon to nitrogen ratio, greatest minimum residence time in the soil based on 14C radioisotope dating, and contained carbon most recalcitrant to microbial digestion. Collectively many of Dr. Laird's contributions to soil science have provided insight into understanding soil organic matter and clay interactions and, thus, the genesis of soil peds from the molecular viewpoint. More recent work has been focused on identifying pyrogenic carbon in soil with an emphasis on biochar soil application and studying the impact of biochar on soil properties. He also founded and led the USDA-ARS Biochar and Pyrolysis Initiative from 2008 - 2010 and has made continued contributions in the characterization of biochar and understanding its role in soil environments."

  "text" : "David Leslie Mason OBE (born 15 March 1939) is a London art dealer and Thalidomide parent activist. He is the parent of a daughter, Louise, disabled by Thalidomide. Mason alone refused the initial offered settlement of £3 million by Distillers Company, which was only to be awarded if all the parents agreed. As a result of which he and his daughter suffered harassment and ostracism. His daughter was removed from his care, due to action by his solicitors and other parents supporting settlement, who believed he was not acting in her best interests by refusing settlement. He launched an appeal, which was successful due to evidence of a more substantial settlement in the USA ($2.7m to Shirley McCarrick in Los Angeles); finally, a Sunday Times story prompted Jack Ashley MP to take up the case in Parliament, and Ralph Nader to organise a boycott of Distillers products in the USA. Distillers increased the offer to £5m and then £20m, which was accepted. The settlement is credited with transforming the lives of British thalidomide victims. The Thalidomide Trust is now largely funded by Diageo, who bought Distillers and its assets and liabilities. Mason's book Thalidomide: My Fight was published in 1976. He was awarded the OBE in the 1996 Birthday Honours 'for services to health charities'. Mason was educated at Highgate School, where he studied under Kyffin Williams. Alongside the family art business, in 1957 he began his involvement with motor racing and in the 1970s he became a sponsor of Formula One. After returning to the sport in 2010 he won the Britcar Endurance Championship in 2014, driving a Ferrari 458 with Calum Lockie."

  "text" : "Deborah Azzopardi was born in 1958 in Golders Green, London. Early in her career, Deborah Azzopardi was a licensee to The Walt Disney Company. She started painting in her 20's, after having her first child. Following a short illness she devoted her life to her family and art. “I have always enjoyed art but didn't have the opportunity to study when I was younger. Life was about survival.\" Reproductions of her work was first sold widely at IKEA. Today, Deborah Azzopardi’s originals are sold through The Cynthia Corbett Gallery  in London, UK and Bonhams and Christie’s auction houses. Deborah Azzopardi works in the style of Pop Art, a 1960s art movement, utilizing flat cartoon-like imagery and bright colour in a manner stylistically similar to American artists Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. Deborah Azzopardi’s distinctive features are her use of basic, bold colours, resulting in large scale compositions that critics have called lively, provoking and humorous. In March 2014, the artist had her first solo UK exhibition of originals and limited editions on Cork Street, London and launched a book, published by Iologies Fine Art Publications. Azzopardi's debut book ‘Sshh…’ showcases her work over the previous 10 years and features more than 100 images and a foreword by art critic, Estelle Lovatt FRSA (Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts). “Unique in approach, you easily recognise an Azzopardi picture. America has Lichtenstein we have Azzopardi. Working simple graphics and toned shading (for depth), the Pop Art line that Azzopardi sketches is different to Lichtenstein’s. Hers is more curvaceous. Feminine. Whereas his lines are male, brash and clunky. And her humour is distinctively British.”extract from the foreword to Deborah Azzopardi’s Book ‘Sshh…’ by Estelle Lovatt FRSA"

  "text" : "Daphne Gail Fautin is an American professor of invertebrate zoology at the University of Kansas, specializing in sea anemones and symbiosis. She is world-renowned for her extensive work studying and classifying sea anemones and related species. A large sea anemone-like cnidarian species has been named in her honor, originally called Boloceroides daphneae, but recently renamed to Relicanthus daphneae, after it was discovered (using DNA-based identification techniques) to belong to a previously unknown cnidarian order. Fautin has published numerous scientific articles and texts—including co-authoring Encyclopedia Britannica's entry on cnidarians—and her publications have been widely cited by other researchers in the field. Among her current positions, she is the curator of the University of Kansas Natural History Museum and serves as vice president and commissioner of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, overseeing the naming of new species. Fautin has been called \"the world authority on [sea] anemones\", by Prof. J. Frederick Grassle of Rutgers University, who led the international Census of Marine Life which was completed in 2010. She has personally identified at least 19 new species and has co-created with her husband, Prof. R. W. Buddemeier of the Kansas Geological Survey, an extensive database of hexacorals and related species as part of the census. Although she lives and works in landlocked Lawrence, Kansas, she feels that working from dry land is not a serious impediment, stating that \"you only need to be near an airport, not the ocean.\""

As Hasbro's head of research and development, Levine guided G.I. Joe through its design and development. Levine served with the United States Army in the Korean War and Hasbro's employees also included many military veterans, so it was decided the toy should be outfitted in the uniforms of the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force and their respective accessories. In 2005-2006, Levine designed and manufactured an action figure of Osama bin Laden for a Central Intelligence Agency psychological warfare program called Devil Eyes. Levine developed a twelve-inch lifelike figure whose face was painted with a material that, when heated, would peel off to reveal a demon-like visage with green eyes and black markings. When asked in 2014 about Levine's involvement in the program, his family said in a statement, \"Don Levine was a dedicated Patriot, and proud Korean War veteran. When called on, he was honored to assist our country.\" In 2014 Levine died from cancer at a Providence, Rhode Island hospice. He is survived by Nan, his wife of nearly 60 years. They have three children and four grandchildren."

  "text" : "Dave Herman (1935 or 1936 – May 28, 2014) was an American disc jockey, popular in the New York metropolitan area from 1972 to 1998. Herman, was born in Huntington and was the son of an Orthodox rabbi Herman began his career at WHTG in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and then moved on to become WMMR's first rock DJ. His show, dubbed The Marconi Experiment, debuted on April 29, 1968. The first song played on the show was \"Flying\" by The Beatles over the intro of which Herman recited these words: \"Arise my heart, and fill your voice with music. For he who shares not dawn with his song, is one of the sons of ever darkness\". He then moved to WABC-FM, which would later become WPLJ. Most notably, he later became the morning drive time DJ on WNEW-FM, where he was the morning host from 1972 to 1982, 1986 to 1991 and then again from 1996 until the station dissolved in 1998. He was one of the station’s best-known voices. He was included on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of notable disc jockeys. In 2013, Herman was arrested at the airport in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, after going there from his vacation home in the area. The criminal complaint stated he expected to meet a woman and her six-year-old daughter, who he allegedly believed was being brought for a sexual encounter with him. He was charged with transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. Herman died of an aneurysm on May 28, 2014, in Essex County Jail in Newark, New Jersey, while awaiting trial. He was 78."

She was born in Sydney to John Ross, the member for Albury in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and Rita, née Mitchell, and was educated at Croydon and Mittagong. She studied at the University of London to become a physical education teacher and then returned to her family property at Holbrook, where she purchased 500 acres from her father in the early 1950s. Around the same time she also joined the Holbrook branch of the Country Women's Association (CWA). In 1971 she became the first single woman to serve as state president of the CWA, a position she held until 1974. In that year she was appointed by the Whitlam Labor government to the National Rural Advisory Council, on which she was the only female member. She ran for the Senate in 1975 and 1977 on the Country Party's ticket, being narrowly defeated both times. In 1976 she joined the fledgling Australian Press Council, and regularly contributed to local newspapers and to The Land, in which she had a weekly column. In 1985 she was elected as the first National President of the CWA, serving until 1988. She was created an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1975, received the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, and was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1991. Ross died on 13 October 1998."

He played for three teams from 1960 to 1965 and was part of the Ottawa Rough Riders' 48th Grey Cup-winning team in 1960. Doug Daigneault was born in Valleyfield, Quebec. After playing college football at Clemson University and participating in three major bowl games, Daigneault joined the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1960, the year they won the 48th Grey Cup, until 1963, while playing both offensive and defensive back, mostly the latter. In 1961, he intercepted 5 passes, his highest total ever. He also rushed for the only touchdown of his career. Injuries limited Daigneault to only six games in 1962 and he played four games for Ottawa in 1963 before being traded to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, where he finished the season with 1 interception. In 1964, Daigneault was traded back east to the Montreal Alouettes, where he remained until 1965, playing in all 14 games during both seasons before retiring. After his CFL career, Daigneault became basketball coach from 1966 to 1989 and assistant athletic director at Loyola College (later Concordia University). Daigneault won the coach of the year award in the Quebec conference during the 1984–85 season. He was also active in the Montreal Alouette Alumni Association."

In 1961, he was involved in a blockbuster trade when he and Bernie Faloney were dealt to the Montreal Alouettes for Hal Patterson and Sam Etcheverry. But since Faloney and Etcheverry exercised their no-trade contract clause, the deal became even up Paquette for Patterson, considered by many people as one of the worst trades in Alouette history. Although Paquette played in all 14 games in 1961 and 1963, he did not stand out and was traded 3 more times before retiring."

After an apprenticeship with a touring company he was engaged by the impresarios George Edwardes and Robert Courtneidge to play comic roles in musical comedy. He also played in variety shows and, later in his career, in farce. Rolyat's greatest success was probably in the double role of John Smith and Simplicitas in The Arcadians (1909), first in the West End of London and then in the British provinces. While playing the role on tour he suffered a severe accident that threatened to end his career. He recovered and worked on until the mid-1920s when ill-health forced him to retire."

  "text" : "David Bates (born June 5, 1957) is an American-born physician, biomedical informatician, and professor, who is internationally renowned for his work regarding the use of health information technology (HIT) to improve the safety and quality of healthcare, in particular by using Clinical Decision Support.Dr. Bates has done especially important work in the area of medication safety. He began by describing the epidemiology of harm caused by medications, first in hospitalized patients and then in other settings such as the home and nursing homes. Subsequently, he demonstrated that by implementing computerized physician order entry (CPOE), medication safety could be dramatically improved in hospitals. This work led the Leapfrog Group to call CPOE one of the four changes that would most improve the safety of U.S. healthcare. It also helped hospitals to justify investing in electronic health records and in particular, CPOE.Throughout his career, Bates has published over 600 peer reviewed articles and is the most cited researcher in the fields of both patient safety and biomedical informatics, with an h-index of 115. In a 2013 analysis published by the European Journal of Clinical Investigation, he ranked among the top 400 living biomedical researchers of any type. He is currently Editor of the Journal of Patient Safety. Currently, Dr. Bates serves as the Chief of the Division of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Medical Director of Clinical and Quality Analysis for Information Systems at Partners HealthCare. In addition, he is a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a Professor of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard School of Public Health. He served as Chief Quality Officer and Senior Vice President of Brigham and Women's from 2011 to 2014. He was appointed Chief Innovation Officer in October 2014, and he directs the Center for Patient Safety Research and Practice there. In addition, he serves as the director of the AHRQ funded Health Information Technology Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (HIT-CERT) and the Patient Centered Learning Lab (PSLL) at the Brigham Center for Patient Safety Research and Practice."

Brat defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the district's 2014 Republican primary on June 10, 2014. Brat's primary victory over Cantor made him the first primary challenger to oust a sitting House Majority Leader since the position's creation in 1899, and is considered one of the biggest upsets in congressional history. Brat defeated Democratic nominee Jack Trammell, a fellow professor at Randolph-Macon College, and Libertarian nominee James Carr on November 4, 2014."

  "text" : "Dick Joy (December 28, 1915 – October 31, 1991) was an American radio and television announcer. A journalism major at the University of Southern California, he went on to become well-known on network radio and television. Joy's involvement with radio at the local level began when, while a student at USC, he worked part-time for radio stations in Los Angeles, California. His first job after graduation was at KEHE, and he later joined the announcing staff of KNX. At age 21, Joy moved up from the local level to CBS, becoming that network's youngest staff announcer in history. By 1937, he was involved with Kathryn Cravens' News Through a Woman's Eye, Good Afternoon Neighbors, Thomas Conrad Sawyer Series Goodyear Sun-up News, and The Newlyweds. In the following three years, he added to his achievements work on My Secret Ambition, Hollywood in Person, Road of Life, I Want a Divorce, College of Musical Knowledge, Burns and Allen, and The Beauty Explorer. Joy went on to be the announcer for numerous network radio programs including The Adventures of Bill Lance, The Danny Kaye Show, Forever Ernest, The Sad Sack, Vox Pop, The Adventures of Sam Spade, Blue Ribbon Town, Dr. Kildare. Nelson Eddy Show, Those We Love, Silver Theatre, New Old Gold Show, Jackie Coogan Show, The Saint, and The Danny Thomas Show. The 1946 edition of Radio Annual reported, \"Dick Joy and Donald C. McBain have opened their new station, KCMJ, at Palm Springs.\"  Thus, Joy began his first venture into ownership of a station while continuing to work on network radio. His entry in the \"Announcers\" section of the 1947 Radio Annual listed 10 network entertainment programs in addition to newscasts. He sold KCMJ in 1950. Like many artists from radio, Joy moved to television as that medium grew in popularity. TV programs for which he was the announcer included December Bride, Perry Mason, Have Gun - Will Travel, Daktari, Lost in Space, Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C., Playhouse 90. and Sheriff of Cochise. Radio/television columnist Glen Stadler reported that Joy eventually left television to return to radio \"because he refused to act like the advertiser demanded ... using the shove-em-at-you technique.\" Joy told Stadler, \"I don't want any more [until] the advertiser ... admits that the buyer has intelligence.\" Returning to local radio in 1951, Joy became news director at KFAC in Los Angeles. Billboard magazine reported that, in addition to being news director, Joy would \"handle all morning newscasts and some early afternoon shows.\" Joy also worked at two Los Angeles television stations, KTTV and KNXT. He retired in 1969."

  "text" : "Dimitrios Avramis (Greek: Δημήτριος Αβράμης; born January 1, 1975, in Trikala) is a retired amateur Greek Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's light heavyweight category. Avramis has claimed a silver medal in the 76-kg division at the 1997 Mediterranean Games in Bari, Italy, picked up a bronze at the 1999 World Wrestling Championships in Athens, and later represented his nation Greece in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Avramis trained as a member of the Greco-Roman wrestling team for Panellinios G.S. in Athens, under his father and personal coach Spyridon Avramis. Avramis emerged himself into the international scene at the 1999 World Wrestling Championships in Athens, where he picked up the bronze medal in the 76-kg division over Georgia's Tarieli Melelashvili that earned him a spot on the Greek Olympic team. The following year, Avramis made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's middleweight division (76 kg). In the prelim pool, he pulled Armenia's Levon Geghamyan off the mat in overtime on his opening bout, but suffered a mighty throw from Sweden's Ara Abrahamian by a 2–3 sudden death decision. Finishing the pool in second place and twelfth overall, Avramis' performance was not enough to put him through into the quarterfinals. When Greece welcomed the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Avramis qualified as a member of the Greek squad in the men's 84 kg class, by obtaining an automatic bid for the host nation and placing second from the European Championships in Haparanda, Sweden. Entering the Games as a top favorite, Avramis delighted the home crowd inside the Ano Liossa Olympic Hall, as he prevailed two straight matches over Iran's Behrouz Jamshidi and Norway's Fritz Aanes in the round-robin pool to take a coveted spot for the next round. As he faced off against Russia's Alexei Mishin in the quarterfinals, Avramis could not hold his tough opponent into the ring and lost the match 2–5. With his next opponent Mohamed Abdelfatah of Egypt being disqualified for protesting, Avramis was immediately awarded a spot in the fifth-place match by forfeit."

Durgamohan Bhattacharyya’s discovery of a living tradition of the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā, unknown until then, was hailed in the Indological world as epoch making. Ludwig Alsdorf went so far as to say that it was the greatest event in Indology. Bhattacharyya died in 1965 leaving his edition of the text incomplete. This task was completed by his son Dipak, whose critical edition of the first 18 kāṇḍas was published by the Asiatic Society, Calcutta came out in three volumes in 1997, 2008 and 2011."

  "text" : "Dave Davis (born August 20, 1937) is an American Shot Putter. He was on the 1960 United States Olympic Team. The circumstances of his failure to throw in those games are one of the quirky stories of the Olympics. Davis almost did not get to the Olympic Trials. As Cordner Nelson wrote at the time, he found himself 45 miles north of the Stanford University stadium at the time his event was about to begin. This was not the first time he had gotten lost on the way to a big meet. Davis spent $18 to rent a seaplane to fly him to the Palo Alto harbor, where he convinced a city employee to drive him to the stadium while he changed his clothes. Arriving after the first two rounds had been completed, he took his qualifying throw with no warm up and made it to the final. In the final, he surpassed Bill Nieder's earlier throw to move into third place. Injured with his leg heavily taped, Nieder was unable to improve and was pushed to the \"alternate\" position, while the team was made up of three University of Southern California alumni (though Davis and Parry O'Brien were officially competing for the Southern California Striders). At the Olympics, it was Davis who was injured. Olympic Team coach Payton Jordan replaced Davis with the alternate Nieder. The Associated Press sent out a picture of Davis congratulating Nieder on his advancement to the Olympics when it was clear his injury would prevent his participation. Nieder went on to win the gold medal and set the world record, leading an American sweep of the medals. Davis was a big, strong man, known for warming up by \"calmly\" lifting 350 pound weights, techniques he later taught to Brian Oldfield. While competing for Canoga Park High School in 1956, Davis set the National High School Record for the shot put at 62' 7½\" which lasted just 5 days. Two weeks later at the CIF California State Meet he easily won the 16 Lb. Shot Put event, at the time a separate event from the standard high school 12 Lb., but lost to high school version to a new national record by Homer Robertson. He also finished third in the discus throw. At USC, he won the 1958 NCAA Championship. In 1963 he won the United States championship. He continued throwing until 1972 setting his personal best of 19.72 in 1967."

In 2007 he studied Georgian and Russian at Malmö University in preparation for his appointment as ambassador. Keefe was Ambassador to Georgia 2007–10 including the Russo-Georgian war in 2008. He was one of the victims of the 2010 Georgian news report hoax. Keefe was Minister and Deputy Head of Mission in Moscow 2010–14. During this time, Russian media harassed him and accused him of being a MI6 officer, possibly because of his supposed actions in Georgia. Keefe was appointed Ambassador to Serbia from June 2014. He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2016 New Year Honours."

  "text" : "Daniel Liczko (Litscho), was a Pole who served as a public official in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam. Born in Koszalin in 1615, Liczko was a sergeant and later lieutenant of the Dutch colonial army under Admiral Christopher Arciszewski in Brazil where in 1646, he married Anna Claes Croesens, the widow of Jan Jansen Swaartveger. Sources seem to indicate that he shortly afterward moved to New Amsterdam since his daughter was baptised there on June 6, 1647. In 1651 Liczko took part in Peter Stuyvesant's expedition on the Delaware River against Sweden, and in 1652 he led a detachment of soldiers who accompanied the governor up the Hudson River where he hauled down the flag of patroon in Reussclaerswyck, thereby freeing the nucleus of the present city of Albany from feudal jurisdiction. Liczko became one of the most prominent citizens of New Amsterdam, and records indicate that he often took part in the deliberations of the council. When New Hollanders felt threatened by an attack of the English Colonies and began to fortify their city, Liczko contributed one hundred Guilders towards the Dutch Colony's defense. Liczko also served as city fire inspector, and in about 1648 founded a tavern, which was one of the important landmarks in New Amsterdam. Liczko died in 1662. Anka Muhlstein, in her history of New York City Manhattan, cited Liczko as one of the three Poles who particularly distinguished themselves among the twenty-one Poles in New Amsterdam at this time. Liczko's daughter Anna married William Peartree, who was the mayor of the city in 1701-1707."

  "text" : "Dinah Nuthead (fl. 1696) was a colonial printer based in the Province of Maryland. She is believed to be the first woman to be licensed as a printer in the Thirteen Colonies. Dinah was born in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Her husband, William Nuthead, established the second colonial printing business in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1682. They moved to St. Mary's City, Maryland, in 1686 and established a press that primarily printed government forms. Following her husband's death in 1695, Nuthead appeared before the Prerogative Court and requested that she be appointed administrator of his estate. John Coode was one of the sureties in her bond. She inherited the press and took over the business. Within a year, the government moved to Annapolis, and Nuthead moved her press there as well. Nuthead petitioned the Maryland General Assembly on May 5, 1696, to grant her a license to print blank forms for the province's public offices as well as writs, bonds, bills, and warrants of attorney. The petition was read to the delegates eight days later. She was required to pay a security of £100 and was granted a license that allowed her to run the press. Nuthead was the first woman to run a printing press outside of Massachusetts and the first woman to be licensed as a printer in the colonies. Only five blank forms attributed to Nuthead's Annapolis press are extant. Many sources indicate that Nuthead was illiterate. She was apparently unable to sign her name, having been compelled to make her mark instead on a government document. Nuthead had two children by her first husband, William and Susannah. She remarried, to Manus Devoran (d. December 1700). Sometime after his death, she married Sebastian Oley of Annarund (d. 1707). She had her third child, Sebastian, with him."

  "text" : "Charles Douglas \"Doug\" Brown (born March 1, 1952 in Detroit, Michigan) is a retired American track and field athlete, whose specialty was the Steeplechase. He competed for the United States in two Olympic Games, running the steeplechase at the 1972 and 1976 Olympics. He was a surprise second place at the 1972 Olympic Trials, sprinting from a battle to make the team around leading contender, hometown favorite Steve Savage who had been battling Mike Manley for the lead. In 1976, with 1972 winner Manley injured hitting a barrier in the first few laps of the race, Brown outsprinted Henry Marsh and picked up the win by .03 of a second. That wasn't even the most thrilling finish in that race, as Mike Roche fell over the last barrier, managed to right himself and outsprint Don Timm for the final position on the team. Brown also made a third Olympic team in 1980, but that was just a status symbol as President Jimmy Carter had already announced the United States would boycott the Olympics. He also ran on the American silver medal winning team at the 1983 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. While competing for the University of Tennessee he won the NCAA Championship in the steeplechase twice in a row, which qualified him to run in the 1973 World University Games. After college he ran with the Athletics West track club, one of the first mega teams sponsored by Nike. He was United States (Amateur Athletic Union) National Champion in 1973 and 1980."

  "text" : "David A. Aitken was a state planning officer of the Ipoh Town Council (now known as the City Council) in early 1961. Ipoh is the capital city of the Malaysian state of Perak. He worked under the administration of E. G. Waller. Aitken and Waller, from their positions as planners, were key figures in bringing architectural modernism to Southeast Asia. They oversaw an extremely ambitious development period in central Malaysia that saw major projects in the public and private sectors. They also helped shift the perception of public housing away from colonial schemes to relocate Chinese villages and thereby fight communism. Under their leadership, Ipoh became a hotbed of architectural modernism, and was an active part in the global effort to combat poverty and provide decent low-cost housing through multiple projects, large and small. In 1961, D. A. Aitken was the mastermind behind the most prominent public housing project, the Sungei Pari Towers. He prepared the layout and scheme with a Municipal Engineer, Mr. E. B. Carlos. No architect other than Aitken is credited for its innovative design. Aitken served in the Town council, and was also a state planning officer. Aitken was an advocate for the benefits of high-rises as part of development schemes. As a testament to his importantance to the region and the nation, Jalan Aitken in Ipoh was named by Yap Lim Seng in his honor."

From 1967 to 1969, he undertook research at the Oxford Centre for Management Studies. An activist in the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP), he was appointed Party Secretary in 1969, and held the post through the 1970s. As the NILP lost members, McIldoon focused on his career at the Department of the Environment. For three years from 1990, he was seconded to the European Commission. In 1995, he was appointed head of The Utility Regulator in Northern Ireland, a role in which he adopted a high profile and was credited by the Belfast Telegraph with achieving lower prices for electricity users. He retired in the 2000s, but was commissioned to produce a report on Northern Irish energy prices in 2008. When the British Labour Party began admitting members in Northern Ireland, Holmes joined. However, the party refused to stand any candidates in the region, and in 2016 Holmes was part of a group which founded the Northern Ireland Labour Representation Committee, a parallel group with the primary purpose of contesting elections, becoming its treasurer."

  "text" : "David Rolf (born 1969) is an American labor union leader who currently serves as president of the Seattle-based Local 775 of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which represents health care workers, and as international vice president of SEIU. He is the author of The Fight for Fifteen: The Right Wage for a Working America (New Press, 2016) about the movement by low-wage workers to earn a higher minimum wage. Rolf was a founder of the Fair Work Center in Seattle, Working Washington, The Workers Lab in Oakland, and the SEIU 775 Benefits Group. Rolf grew up in Cincinnati and was influenced by members of his family, including his mother, who worked as a unionized teacher, and his grandfathers. His maternal grandfather was a General Motors employee and United Automobile Workers (UAW) member who participated in labor demonstrations, and his paternal grandfather was a Procter & Gamble employee who put himself through law school and eventually became a lawyer and politician. During his time at Bard College in New York, Rolf interned at a local chapter of SEIU. He later accepted an entry-level position as an organizer for the Atlanta chapter. In 1998, he worked opposite the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to organize home-care workers. The negotiations resulted in the Board establishing a public authority that was joined by 74,000 workers, becoming the largest union drive since Ford River Rouge Complex autoworkers joined UAW 70 years earlier. Rolf has been credited for helping to pass the November 2013 ballot measure in SeaTac, Washington known as Proposition 1, which set a $15-per-hour minimum wage for airport and hotel workers. He has also been credited for making a $15-per-hour minimum wage part of Ed Murray's agenda. Rolf served on Murray's transition team following his successful bid for Mayor of Seattle in 2013, and was named co-chair of his Income Inequality Advisory Committee. Rolf's minimum wage work earned him recognition from the White House as a \"Champion of Change\". Rolf advocates for change and innovation within the labor union movement, including the use of social networking services, and is known for challenging politicians and collaborating with leaders of various sectors."

Fuchs was born in a wealthy family, and besides gymnastics trained in the javelin throw and triple jump. Her sister Inge was also an international gymnast. At the 1960 Olympics Fuchs became friend with the Soviet boxer Boris Nikonorov. She visited Nikonorov's family in 1963, when the U.S. gymnastics team had a competition in Moscow, and had a long correspondence by mail, which was suppressed by the KGB."

  "text" : "Don Stap (born 1949) is an American author who writes poetry and nonfiction prose. Stap grew up in the farm country of southwestern Michigan. Surrounded by hundreds of acres of fields, woods, lakes, and marshes, he developed an interest in the natural world, which is the subject of much of his writing. His mother passed on to him an interest in birds in particular. Stap has a sister and a brother, and a son, Benjamin. He graduated from Gull Lake High School in 1967 and attended Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, receiving his B.A. in English in 1972. In 1978, he received a Ph.D. from the University of Utah. He worked for several years as a freelance writer, but since 1985 has taught at the University of Central Florida. Stap has published a collection of poems, Letter at the End of Winter (1987), and two nonfiction works related to natural history, A Parrot Without a Name (Knopf, 1990) and Birdsong (Scribner, 2005). A Parrot Without a Name focuses on the ornithological exploration of South America and the fieldwork of John O’Neill, who has discovered more than a dozen new species of birds in the neotropics, and the legendary Ted Parker (Theodore A. Parker III), who could identify more than 4,000 species of birds by their songs alone. Stap spent time in Peru with both scientists, including a three-month expedition led by O’Neill into an unexplored region near the Peru – Brazil border. A Parrot Without a Name was widely reviewed, including the front page review of the New York Review of Books by George Plimpton who called the book a “richly detailed account ... [that] captures the excitement as well as the vicissitudes of the quest” to discover new species. For Birdsong, Stap accompanied Donald Kroodsma, one of the world experts on birdsong, on trips from Martha’s Vineyard to the tropical forests of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Kroodsma’s enduring fascination with the simple question of why birds sing and what their songs mean led to a discovery that sheds light on the mystery of mysteries: why young birds in the suborder oscines—the “true songbirds”—learn their songs but the closely related suboscines are born with their songs genetically encoded. Publisher’s Weekly called Birdsong “a lucidly written combination of scientific lore and vivid reportage.” Stap and Kroodsma were interviewed on National Public Radio by Terry Gross for her program “Fresh Air.” Stap’s poetry has appeared in TriQuarterly, Poetry, Northwest Review, The Massachusetts Review, The American Scholar, Alaska Quarterly Review, Prairie Schooner, and elsewhere. His prose appears frequently in Audubon, and he’s published as well in Smithsonian, Orion, National Wildlife, Living Bird, The North American Review, and Fourth Genre. His prose has been anthologized in many places including The Best American Science and Nature Writing. Stap is the recipient of a Creative Writing Fellowship from National Endowment for the Arts and two Individual Artist Fellowships from the Florida Division of Cultural Affairs."

  "text" : "Diletta Giampiccolo (born July 27, 1974 in Catania) is a retired amateur Italian freestyle wrestler, who competed in the women's lightweight category. Considered one of Europe's top female freestyle wrestlers in her decade, Giampiccolo has claimed two gold medals at the Mediterranean Games (2001 and 2005), scored a silver in the 62-kg division at the 2001 World Wrestling Championships in Martigny, France, and also finished tenth at the 2004 Summer Olympics, representing her nation Italy. Throughout her sporting career, Giampiccolo trained full-time for Polisportiva Mandraccio Wrestling Club in Genoa, under her personal coach Lucio Caneva. Giampiccolo reached sporting headlines at the 2001 Mediterranean Games in Tunis, Tunisia, where she picked up the gold medal in the women's 62 kg class. Two months later, she captured the silver in the same class at the World Championships in Martigny, France, losing out to China's Meng Lili by a 3–0 verdict. Her sporting success continued to flourish at the next two World Championships, but she left both tournaments empty handed with mediocre results. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Giampiccolo qualified for the Italian squad in the women's 55 kg class. Earlier in the process, she finished second from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tunis, Tunisia to guarantee her place on the Italian wrestling team. She lost two straight matches each to China's Sun Dongmei with a 2–4 decision, and eventual Olympic champion Saori Yoshida of Japan on technical superiority that left her on the bottom of the prelim pool, placing eleventh in the final standings. With Puerto Rico's Mabel Fonseca being disqualified for failing the doping test on stanozolol, Giampiccolo upgraded her position to tenth. In 2005, Giampiccolo campaigned her title defense in the women's lightweight category (59 kg) at the Mediterranean Games in Almería, Spain to cap off her sporting career, overpowering the host nation's Seba Jimenez in the process."

Raised in Pacific Palisades, CA, he attended the Brentwood Art Center, learning to draw and paint. He also studied Cybernetics at University of California, Los Angeles. After moving to Arizona, Daniel Edlen began creating his vinyl art using a modified pointillistic technique. White acrylic paint dabbed on creates an image \"a bit like a black and white newspaper photo in reverse\". It is noted that painting the recycled records is \"a meticulous process that... often translates to one hyper-realistic rendering per month\". It's also been remarked that it is \"a truly unique message-meets-medium portraiture technique, using the physical canvas of artists’ talent — their records — to paint portraits of them in white acrylic.\"Notable works have been shown by VH1, commissioned by the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Hollywood and VEVO, as well as done for the Roger Steffens Reggae Archives. Edlen was also commissioned by the David Lynch Foundation to paint a series of pieces, which were signed by the artists like Tom Waits and Iggy Pop to be auctioned to benefit the foundation.In an interview with Phoenix Magazine, Edlen stated his reason for creating his Vinyl Art, \"They celebrate the subject and the object, the art and the artifact.”"

Peach joined BBC Radio 1 in 1984 presenting a Saturday evening show called Midnight Runner which specialized in American style rock and funk. He was the third black Radio DJ (after Al Matthews and Ranking Miss P) on Radio 1. On TV he hosted editions of Top of the Pops. In 1987 he left Radio 1 and in 1991 he joined CNFM where he hosted the morning show, he later departed from the station in late 1992 and joined BFBS Radio where he presented Music Choice Europe.

  "text" : "Duncan McRae (1919-1984) was an American industrial designer who spent the majority of his career designing automobiles. After spending a couple of summers working as a laborer and clay modeler for Ford Motor Company, McRae was hired as a designer at Kaiser-Frazier Corporation in September, 1949 where he was involved with the development of the 1951 Kaiser. He went on to work at Studebaker Packard Corporation beginning in August, 1955, where he became chief stylist. Along with other designers at Studebaker, McRae helped design several models, including the 1958 Packard Hawk and the 1959 Studebaker Lark, a small car which sold in sufficient numbers to keep Studebaker afloat for several more years. McRae left Studebaker in 1960 and worked for a year at Curtiss-Wright Corporation. He then operated his own design studio in Muskegon, Michigan, working on various freelance design projects. In 1964 McRae was hired by Ford Motor Company as a designer. He was transferred later that year to Ford of England, where we worked on the design of the Mark II Cortina, the Escort and the original Capri. In 1967 McRae was transferred to Ford of Germany where he led the design team which developed the Taunus 23M. After spending a year back at Ford's design center in Dearborn, Michigan, McRae was transferred to Ford of Australia in September 1969 where he became chief of design. McRae retired from Ford Motor Company in 1975 and moved to Australia where he operated a cattle farm in Apollo Bay, Victoria for several years before returning to live in Ann Arbor, Michigan until his death in 1984."

Khalimov also trained full-time for Professional Sport Club Daulet in Almaty, under his personal coach Anvar Sagitov. Khalimov qualified for his naturalized Kazakh squad in the men's 74 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, he finished fourth from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Créteil, France, and then captured the silver medal at the Asian Championships to guarantee a spot on the Kazakh wrestling team. He ousted Georgian-born wrestler Yasha Manasherov of Israel in his opening match by a quick 8–0 margin, and then brushed aside Olympic veteran José Alberto Recuero of Spain with a tough 3–2 decision in the prelim pool to secure his place for the next round of the competition. Khalimov lost in overtime to Switzerland's Reto Bucher in the quarterfinal match at 0–3, but easily scored a triumph in a fifth-place playoff against two-time Olympic champion Filiberto Azcuy of Cuba, who withdrew from the tournament because of an injury."

  "text" : "Dorothy Ward (26 April 1890 – 30 March 1987) was an English actress who specialised in pantomime performances - she would play the principal boy, while her husband Shaun Glenville would play the dame. Ward was born in Aston (now part of Birmingham), Warwickshire, England, on 26 April 1890, to Edwin Ward and Eliza (née Millichamp). She made her stage debut at the Alexandra Theatre in Birmingham in 1905, playing Zenobia in Bluebeard. She appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 23 December 1954. Ward performed a number of songs by her and Glenville's friend, Fred Godfrey. She died on 30 March 1987; Glenville, whom she married on 13 May 1911, having pre-deceased her in 1966, following their joint retirement to London in 1957. Their son was the actor and director Peter Glenville. Music Hall historian W. Macqueen-Pope called her: a handsome and striking woman, with auburn hair, wonderful carriage and fine figure... Tights become her, they are second nature to her and she understands pantomime and its topsy turviness. To see her as \"Jack\" in Jack and the Beanstalk defy the giant outside his castle, wearing shining armour and then join in mortal combat with him in his own kitchen, clad in trailing clouds of gauze and silk, is to witness true pantomime... [She] left the halls plenty of fine songs."

  "text" : "Darsie Japp (17 February 1883–1973) was an English painter and soldier. Japp was born in Liverpool and attended St John's College of the University of Oxford. After he graduated he worked in the offices of his father's shipping company in the City of London between 1904 and 1907. Whilst working in the City Japp studied at the night school of the Lambeth School of Art under Philip Connard. Japp studied at the Slade School of Art between 1908 and 1909, where he became friends with his fellow student Stanley Spencer and would often visit him in his home at Cookham in Berkshire. Japp specialised in landscape and figure paintings and exhibited with the New English Art Club of which he became a member in 1919. At the start of the First World War Japp joined the British Army and, eventually, became a Major in the Royal Field Artillery commanding an artillery battery in Macedonia, for which he was awarded the Military Cross. Coincidentally Spencer also served in Macedonia in the last years of the war and the British War Memorial Committee was keen for both men to be released from their military duties to work on paintings for the proposed, but never built, national Hall of Remembrance. The Army refused to release either of them until after the Armistice, when Japp, following a visit to the Western Front, began work on the painting The Royal Field Artillery in Macedonia, Spring 1918 (1919), which is now part of the collection of the Imperial War Museum. Shortly after the War Japp gave up painting professionally to farm and to breed race horses in Berkshire. Henry Lamb painted a group portrait of Japp and his family in 1928, which is now in Manchester Art Gallery. Japp left England in 1926 and for the next 27 years lived in France and Spain, before returning to England in 1953. He left England again to live in Portugal some years later."

  "text" : "Damir Zakhartdinov (Uzbek: Дамир Захартдинов; born January 2, 1976 in Tashkent) is a retired amateur Uzbek freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's lightweight category. Considering one of the nation's top wrestlers in his decade, Zakhartdinov has yielded a staggering record of six career medals, including a bronze in the 58-kg division at the 1999 World Wrestling Championships in Ankara, Turkey, and seized an opportunity to represent Uzbekistan in three editions of the Olympic Games (1996, 2000, and 2004). Having served as a soldier in CSKA Tashkent, Zakhartdinov trained throughout his sporting career as a member of its wrestling team under head coach Mamur Ruziev. Zakhartdinov made his official debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where he competed in the men's bantamweight class (57 kg). Being successful early in the opening rounds, he entered the third round undefeated, but fell to Canada's Guivi Sissaouri with a 0–8 verdict. He lost again to Iran's Mohammad Talaei in the repechage 2–4, and subsequently, to Belarus' Aleksandr Guzov in the final playoff by a rigid 3–2 verdict, dropping him to eighth place. Determined to return to the Olympic scene, Zakhartdinov entered the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as a top medal contender in the men's featherweight division (58 kg). Earlier in the process, he picked up a bronze over Armenia's Martin Berberyan at the 1999 World Wrestling Championships in Ankara, Turkey. During the preliminary competition, Zakhartdinov lost his opening match 4–1 to Russia's Murad Ramazanov, but bounced back to subdue Turkey's Harun Doğan (3–0) and pin Moldova's Octavian Cuciuc with only thirty seconds left. Zakhartdinov placed first during the preliminary competition based on technical points, reached the semifinals, but fell behind Ukraine's Yevhen Buslovych in overtime with a 2–0 decision. Zakhartdinov faced U.S. wrestler Terry Brands in the bronze medal match, but could not throw him down the mat and missed the podium by a single point to close the record 3–2, finishing only in fourth place. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Zakhartdinov qualified for his third Uzbek squad, as a 28-year-old, in the men's 60 kg class. Weighing at two kilograms heavier than the previous Games, Zakhartdinov received a berth and rounded out the ninth spot in the lightweight category from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States. He started the preliminary competition with a surprising 3–2 victory over Japan's Kenji Inoue, before being overwhelmed by Austria's Lubos Cikel in a 5–6 verdict and South Korea's Jung Young-ho on a marvelous technical fall. Placing last in the preliminary competition and ninth overall, Zakhartdinov failed to advance to the quarterfinals. Zakhartdinov also competed in two editions of the Asian Games (2002 and 2006), but fell behind the medal podium. Shortly after his sporting career ended in 2006, he moved to the United States to work with Rod Gaddy and coach young wrestlers for the Alabama State Wrestling Team in Birmingham, Alabama."

At the end the name chosen was Edsel. Given the responsibility of researching potential names and being frustrated by conventional research, Wallace secured the aid of poet Marianne Moore who did not disappoint with such suggestions as Mongoose Civique, Resilient Bullet, Andante con Moto and Utopian Turtletop among others. The entire correspondence was later reproduced in The New Yorker (April 13, 1957, pp 130–136). It was up to Wallace to inform Miss Moore of Ford’s final choice which he did in this pungent letter: November 8, 1956 Dear Miss Moore, Because you were so kind to us in our early and hopeful days of looking for a suitable name, I feel a deep obligation to report on events that have ensued. And I feel I must do so before the public announcement of same come Monday, November 19. We have chosen a name out of the more than six thousand-odd candidates that we gathered. It has a certain ring to it. It fails somewhat of the resonance, gaiety, and zest we were seeking. But it has a personal dignity and meaning to many of us here. Our name, dear Miss Moore, is—Edsel. I hope you will understand. Cordially,David Wallace,Special Products Division (The New Yorker, April 17, 1957, p 136) Wallace later wrote of his experiences with Ford Motor Co. in Automotive Quarterly, \"Something went wrong. History had never witnessed anything like it before. More money was spent in its launching than any other previous product offered upon the consumer market anywhere – a quarter of a billion dollars. It was to be the most perfectly conceived automobile the world had ever seen – every part of its planning guided by public opinion polls, motivational research, Science. It did not work out that way…\" (Automobile Quarterly, 1975, Vol. XIII, No. 2, “Naming the Edsel”, p. 182-191)"

He painted frescos for the San Piero a Grado church which was commissioned by the Caetani family for the 1300 jubilee. In the lower part are Portraits of Popes, from St. Peter to John XVIII (1303); the intermediate portion has thirty panels with Histories of St. Peter's Life (as well of those of St. Paul, Constantine and St. Sylvester), similar to those in the Old St. Peter's Basilica and to Cimabue's work at San Francesco in Assisi. In the upper area are portrayed the Walls of the Heaven City, largely restored in the following centuries.

  "text" : "Henry Digby Morton (1906–1983) was an Irish fashion designer and among the leading names of British couture in the period from 1930-50. He was also among the pioneers of ready-to-wear fashions in the 1950s. Successful on both sides of the Atlantic, he redefined women's suits and tailoring, earned himself the moniker 'Daring Digby' for his US fashion venture and helped to establish the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers, an early forerunner of the British Fashion Council. His contemporary Hardy Amies said of Morton: \"[His] philosophy was to transform the suit from the strict tailleur, or the ordinary country tweed suit with its straight up and down lines, uncompromising and fit only for the moors, into an intricately cut and carefully designed garment that was so fashionable that it could be worn with confidence at the Ritz\"."

His friend and director, Peter Farrelly, was with him at the accident. Murphy criticized Farrelly for not including handicapped people in his movie Dumb & Dumber. This led to Murphy's first movie role in Farrelly's comedy movie Kingpin. Murphy died in Florida from cancer, aged 58."

  "text" : "David Laurent de Lara (c.1806, Amsterdam - 1876) was a London-based, Dutch-born limner of Spanish descent. He has been described as a pioneer who helped illumination to become recognised as an artform in its own right at a time when very few had ready access to the original illuminated manuscripts or to fine quality reproductions. His illuminated Hebrew calendar and almanac, and a portrait of Hananel De Castro, 1840-1 president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, led to his being greatly admired among London's Jewish community. He exhibited a custom-designed illuminated chess table for the Queen and Prince Albert at The Great Exhibition of 1851. Lara published Elementary instruction in the art of illumination and missal painting on vellum in 1850, which went to several editions. From the second expanded edition (1857), he described himself on the title page as illuminating artist to Queen Victoria, though he may simply have supplied teaching materials to the Royal children, if not actually taught them illumination which they were studying from at least 1855. The book consisted of 48 pages, with six illustrations, four coloured, and was published by the firm of Ackermann, who specialised in such instructive books and also sold the papers, designs and pigments called for in order to follow the instructions within. In 1857 Lara established the Illuminating Art Society. Its first exhibition in 1859, was reviewed by The Art Journal, and The Athenaeum, though any subsequent shows appear to not have been reviewed. Illumination was promoted as an acceptable form of employment for women, enabling highly educated ladies to occupy themselves in an appropriately non-menial way by creating illuminated material for sale. By 1860, the Art Journal had changed its mind, and argued that it was not possible for a woman to support herself through illumination. According to his granddaughter, the pianist and composer Adelina de Lara's autobiography, David Laurent de Lara was the son of a Spanish count called Laurent de Lara. David married a London-born Polish Jewish woman, Sarah Cracour."

He moved to Montreal in the early 2000s and then to Berlin in 2005. In 2012, Gardner returned to Canada's west coast, while continuing to maintain his Berlin ties and tour internationally. Though Gardner is included in the techno and house genres, his style is also described as jazz-inflected microhouse. He is known for his improvised live performances which have included his DIY instruments such as the electromagnetic knife. He has more than 40 releases to his credit, including the 2014 album Lost and Forgotten, which followed his third full-length album, Meteorology, released in 2011, on Luciano's Cadenza label."

Initially the artist was only known by the nickname Master of the Johnson Nativity. Florentine scholar Cristina Acidini Luchinat identified this anonymous artist in 1992 as Dominic di Zenobi who was a contemporary of Filippo Lippi, and worked as his assistant in Florence and Prato. His activity is attested between 1460 and 1481. Active in Prato in 1460, Zanobi returned to work in Florence, where he entered the studio of Paolo Uccello in Via delle Terme. He collaborated with several Florentine artists, including Filippino Lippi and Domenico di Michelino. His style evolved through contact with the works of Andrea del Castagno, Alesso Baldovinetti and Sandro Botticelli. The art scholar Bernard Berenson regarded him as a follower of Cosimo Rosselli."

He stars in Finding The Funny, the documentary on teaching stand up comedy directed by John Bizarre. \"Down and dirty is the theme but that doesn't necessarily mean nasty. What it means is no holds barred and we're bringing the funny!\" said Barnhart in a recent interview. \"When I hosted The Freedom of Speech Comedy Show, people thought that the title meant the show would be 'F this' and \"F that' but what it meant was, we didn't hold back, we let loose and brought the funny with no political correctness, gimmicks or corporate overlord micro-managing what we could or could not say. The first rule was that it had to be funny!\" Jokesters Comedy Club at the D starts with a pre-show party at 10:00pm with crazy drink specials, comedy trivia and prizes with the comedy show kicking in at 10:30. The D is known for a fresh, energetic attitude and fun atmosphere synonymous with Downtown Las Vegas. The newly renovated property features a high-energy gaming experience and 638 remodeled contemporary rooms and suites. The unique two-level casino boasts the latest in slots and table games manned by the D's playful dancing dealers on the first floor, and transports guests back in time to old-school Vegas with its Vintage Casino on the second floor. Voted \"Best Video Poker\" by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the D is the best place to stay and play. On Fremont Street Experience, D Bar features Vegas' hottest dancing servers and talented flair bartenders. While Barnhart will still honor his current dates on the books, when he's home he'll be performing nightly doing what critics say is, \"a comedy thrill ride of well-written, topical material exploring modern day society in a way that is hysterical, highly entertaining, intelligent and thought provoking. The Las Vegas Review Journal recently called Barnhart's show one of their \"Best Bets\". Barnhart currently stars in the new sitcom and web series Class Clowns. The show, created by Don follows the miss-adventures of fictional comedian and former sitcom star Johnny B who pulls a \"Kramer\" takes a \"Chappell\" and comes back to star in his own \"Seinfeld\" type of web series and reality show. The show, written by Barnhart and comedIan Keith Lyle who is most known for his snarky card dealer role in The Hangover, takes place in Las Vegas. Lyle has also toured with Barnhart on the Battle Comics World Tours for the troops and Armed Forces Entertainment and will serve as one of Jokesters house emcees. Class Clowns also stars fellow Vegas comedians Derek Richards, Brent Mukai and Linda Vu all who can be seen performing at Jokesters. Richards also went overseas with Barnhart and the two will trade off headline dates filling in for one another when they are out on tour and perform together when they are both in town. Featuring for Barnhart is comedian Linda Vu who just completed her third Battle Comics tour for the troops. Linda's unique perspective as an Asian American who immigrated to the United States is hysterically insightful and downright funny. Linda is also an actress and stars in the indie film China Dolls. For years, Barnhart has made a living headlining the top Comedy Clubs, cruise ships, corporate events, shows for the military and venues in Las Vegas and Don has notoriously performed clean and now he's letting loose and pulling no punches. He added, \"I've always felt that dirty comics aren't always funny but funny comics can be dirty.\""

She witnessed the evacuation of Regelap and Utirik Atolls after they were contaminated by radioactive fallout. Keju is credited for bringing to the attention of the world the suffering of the Marshall Islanders as a result of the nuclear testing and that many more people were affected than acknowledged by the U.S. government. The book Don't Ever Whisper written by her husband Giff Johnson tells of her fight to share the Marshall Islanders' plight with the rest of the world wasn't being told of the events. He was interviewed by ABC Radio presenter Geraldine Coutts in 2013. On June 17, 2006 she was commemorated on the 20th anniversary of the founding of Youth-to-Youth in Health (YTYIH) organization, which she established in 1986."

  "text" : "Dieric Bouts the Younger, also Dirk Bouts the Younger, (1448–May 2,1491) was a Belgian painter of the Early Netherlandish painting era. Dieric was born into a family of painters in Leuven. He was trained by his father the painter Dieric Bouts the Elder (ca.1415-1475), and his brother was Aelbrecht Bouts (1450s-1549). His son Jan Bouts (1478-1531) also became a painter. Dieric inherited his father’s shop in 1475, while his brother Aelbrecht established his own workshop, also in Leuven. Whereas Dieric the Younger continued in his father's style, Aelbrecht developed his own unmistakable style with strong colors, rich texture and fine details. In 1486 he was commissioned to work with his brother on the wings of the triptych of the Holy Sacrament in St. Peter's Church, Leuven. Because his painting style was that of his father almost indistinguishable, it is difficult to attribute paintings. There are art historians who attribute the work The Pearl of Braban, a wing altar display in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich directly to the Younger. However, other art historians attribute it to his father because of the high quality of work. Bouts died at a young age on May 2, 1491. His brother Albert became guardian of his minor son Jan who was also active as a painter in Mechelen."

In Naples he was very successful, especially for his cityscapes. He primarily painted scenes featuring decrepit ruins or near-barren buildings in a nearly-surrealist, apparently post-apocalyptic landscape. Until the mid-twentieth century Barra's works were believed to be by one \"Monsù Desiderio\". However the works formerly attributed to Desiderio have since been identified as the work of at least three artists: Barra, François de Nomé, who was also from Metz, and a third, as yet unnamed painter. The similarities in both themes and style, and the fact that there were occasions where Barra and de Nomé collaborated, have made attributions challenging. One work executed by Barra Saint Standing in a Niche is part of the Courtauld Gallery collection. He died in Naples in 1656."

In 1970 he raced his first CanAm car. He decided to call it Shadow, with the team's logo featuring a cloaked spy. Jackie Oliver won the CanAm title for Shadow in 1974. With major sponsorship from Universal Oil Products, Nichols expanded his operation and entered F1 at the start of 1973 with Oliver and George Follmer driving. In 1975 Oliver became the team's commercial director, but the original sponsor pulled out and could not be adequately replaced. In 1977 most of the team management walked out of Shadow to join the Arrows team. Nichols sued and won, claiming copyright infringement, and that year Alan Jones scored Shadow's single Grand Prix victory. Shadow was in financial decline, however, and in 1981 Nichols sold his assets to the Theodore team of Chinese businessman Teddy Yip."

L. Ollard edited Ogg's festschrift and said of Ogg: Those who have had the privilege of knowing David Ogg as a tutor or a colleague will not need to be reminded of those qualities of wit and intellectual elegance, of originality of thought and expression, of common sense applied in an uncommon way, that characterise his talk as unmistakenly as his writing. The deceptive ease with which his exact scholarship and wide erudition have been put at our disposal is no small part of the pleasant debt we all owe him...It would be an imperceptive reader who failed to notice that in both the fields that Ogg has made his own, the England of Charles II and the Europe of Louis XIV, he has challenged both the accepted historiography of the period and the fashionable portrayal of the two eponymous figures of the age. It could be imperceptive, but it would not be impossible. The modulations of irony, the subtle effects of tone, the humility in which, above all, the style reveals the man, will be lost on such as prefer vulgar colours, familiar platitudes, and the techniques of self-advertisement in which modern scholarship can report such notable advances. But the continued and increasing success of Europe in the Seventeenth Century and England in the Reign of Charles II gives good ground for believing that [his] rare qualities...have been recognised and valued by a far wider public. Of the influence exerted by these books on students of the period there can be no doubt."

Originally from San Diego, California, McCain, a graduate from Robbinsdale Cooper High School in New Hope, Minnesota, converted to Islam in 2004, and traveled to Syria by way of Turkey in early 2014. He was the first U.S. citizen known to be killed while fighting for the ISIL. At the time of McCain's death, there were reportedly \"dozens\" more Americans fighting in Syria for Islamic militant groups. The first U.S. citizen killed fighting in the Syrian Civil War was Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha in May 2014. McCain attended the same high school as did Troy Kastigar, also from the U.S., died as an Islamic extremist, in 2009 in Somalia. The two may have been roommates."

  "text" : "Dimosthenis Valavanis (Greek: Δημοσθένης Βαλαβάνης 1829-1854) was a Greek poet of the First Athenian School. He was born in 1829 in Karytaina. As a child he was orphaned and moved with relatives in Nauplio where he finished school. He enrolled in the faculty of Medicine in the University of Athens. Before graduating he contracted tuberculosis and died in 1854. As he died very young he did not manage to publish a poetry collection. Some of his poems were published in literary magazines. He is one of the few poets of the First Athenian School that wrote poems both in Katharevousa and Demotic Greek. He also wrote a novel titled Two Nights which was published in Euterpi magazine and a tragedy (The death of Papaflessas) which is lost. Modern critics have found in his work the prospects of a creative force which was cut short because of his early death."

  "text" : "Douglas E. Smith (28 October 1960 – 7 September 2014) was a video game designer best known as the author of the 8-bit game Lode Runner (1983) considered a seminal work of the 1980s. Smith, of Renton, Washington, wrote his most famous game while an architecture student at the University of Washington. He wrote the core game over the course of a single weekend in 6502 assembly language on an Apple II+. He borrowed money to purchase a color monitor and joystick and continued to improve the game. Around Christmas of 1982, he submitted the game to four publishers and quickly received offers. He took the deal with Brøderbund and the games was published in 1983. It was one of the first games to include a level-editor. During the 1990s, he was executive producer of the English-language version of Secret of Mana and contributed to the localization of Chrono Trigger.

She represented her nation Mexico at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and later picked up a silver medal in windsurfing at the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara. As of September 2014, Vega is ranked seventh in the world for the sailboard class by the International Sailing Federation, following her successes at the North American and ISAF World Championships. Vega qualified for the Mexican squad in the newly introduced RS:X class at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing by placing second and receiving a berth from the World Championships in Auckland, New Zealand. She posted a net score of 190 points to claim a creditable twenty-third spot in a fleet against twenty-six other windsurfers. At the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Vega sailed smoothly in all the races with a remarkable grade of 28 to settle only for the silver medal in the women's sailboard class, falling behind Brazil's Patrícia Freitas by a 16-point gap. She also sought to compete for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, but failed to fulfill her requirements with the Mexican Sailing Federation with a prospect to grant a place for her in the same class. Two years later, at the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships in Santander, Spain, Vega picked up a twenty-fourth spot in the women's RS:X class, and is expected to compete for the Mexican sailing squad on her second Games in Rio de Janeiro."

  "text" : "Deirdre Mullins is an Irish film, television & theatre actor, director and voice artist. She is best known for playing series regular Naomi in Channel 4's Man Down opposite Greg Davies and Rik Mayall. Man Down was nominated for Best New Comedy Programme in the British Comedy Awards 2014. Other notable roles include Rosalind in As You Like It at Shakespeare's Globe, Chekhov's lover, Lika, in the world premier of Marina Carr's 16 Possible Glimpses at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin and Jessie Taite in Seán O'Casey's The Silver Tassie at the National Theatre. Most recently, she's been shooting The Frankenstein Chronicles for ITV Encore playing opposite Sean Bean as his young wife and is currently filming new TV series Will about the life of William Shakespeare, playing Anne Shakespeare. She is represented by The Artists Partnership in the UK and Lisa Richards in Ireland. Her directing debut, a production of Mary Zimmerman's Metamorphoses, was set in a hotel swimming pool and won her rave reviews at the Edinburgh Fringe 2006 including The Scotsman's top 5 shows to see at the Fringe. It was in Time Out's top 3 shows at the Fringe; giving it 5 stars, Rachel Halliburton said 'This is the kind of unexpected discovery that critics live for at Edinburgh'. A decade later, Mullins directed her second show, an experimental new play by Bea Roberts, Infinity Pool, which won a Toast of the Fringe Award at Plymouth Fringe Festival. Named one of The Independent's 12 most promising shows at the Edinburgh Fringe & International Festival 2016, it went on to enjoy a place on The Guardian's list of recommended shows at the festival, critic Lyn Gardner describing it as 'painfully funny'. Infinity Pool also received 5 stars from The Stage where Stewart Pringle described it as 'utterly unique and exceptional in every way, it’s a heart-breaking story of a stunted life, told with theatrical verve and palpable compassion'. It was short-listed for the highly prestigious Total Theatre Award. Mullins was continuity announcer for ITV3 from Dec 2012 - Dec 2013 and is represented by Sue Terry Voices. Her most recent audio drama work includes playing Mina opposite Mark Gatiss in Dracula by Big Finish Productions. Mullins was head girl at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin. She read Drama & Theatre Studies at Trinity College Dublin before transferring and finishing with a first class degree in English Literature at the University of St Andrews, Scotland in 2006. She trained as an actor at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School from 2006 - 2008 and now lives in London."

In 1908 he became an instructor and assistant in the Laboratory of Animal Nutrition at the University of California at Berkeley, an institution with which he would be associated for the remainder of his life. He worked in the field of animal nutrition and biochemistry until 1912, when he entered the graduate school in the department of agricultural chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, receiving his master's degree in 1913. The following year he became assistant professor of agricultural chemistry at Berkeley. A Hoagland hydroponic solution provides every nutrient necessary for plant growth being appropriate for the growth of a large variety of plant species. The solution described by Hoagland and Arnon in 1938 has been modified several times, notably with the addition of iron chelates."

His unit experienced extremely heavy casualties, but Scannell returned to New York uninjured. In 1851 he moved from New York to California during the California Gold Rush.He joined San Francisco's volunteer fire department, and enrolled in a local militia. Scannell was San Francisco's third elected Sheriff, serving from 1855 to 1856. When San Francisco Fire Department transitioned from an organization staffed by volunteers to one staffed by full-time paid staff Scannell served as its first fire chief. Scannell's will established an award, the David S. Scannell Medal, to be given annually to an outstanding San Francisco firefighter. The city named a fireboat after Scannell in 1909."

  "text" : "Doris B. Fuller (died early 1962) was an American bridge player and teacher from New York City. She was the wife of Robert B. \"Bob\" Fuller. The veteran New York Times bridge columnist Albert Morehead wrote in tribute, under the subheading \"Colorful Player Dies\" on February 6, 1962: \"The death of Doris Fuller (Mrs. Robert B. Fuller) last week removed from the bridge scene one of the most colorful characters of the times thirty or more years ago when contract bridge was a new game.\" She had been a bridge teacher and club duplicate director, as well as a champion player. According to Morehead, \"many an aspiring young bridge expert\" during the Great Depression played bridge for the money to live. \"Bob Fuller was making a living and his wife always had a spare dollar for anyone who couldn't eat without it.\" Fuller directed both regular bridge games at \"several New York clubs\" and some special events. Prior to the annual Asbury Park tournament in 1941, for example, she and Al Sobel held in a city hotel \"their annual duplicate game\" whose prize was payment of tournament entry fees; she and Mrs. E. M. Goddard conducted tournament \"warm-up games\". Fuller first won the American Bridge League or \"national\" championship for women teams-of-four in 1935 with Helen White, Florence Stratford, and Angela Quigley. Fuller and White were partners at least on the deal featured in a Morehead bridge column. The same foursome were champions again in 1936, and runners-up in 1937 when White was newly wed to Al Sobel – or Helen Sobel, as she became world famous."

  "text" : "Darrin Lamoureux is a politician in Saskatchewan, Canada. He was acclaimed leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party on August 8, 2014 after serving as interim party leader since December 16, 2013. His older brother Kevin Lamoureux is a Manitoba politician and MP for the constituency of Winnipeg North and his niece Cindy Lamoureux is an MLA in the Manitoba Legislature. The Liberals have not held a seat in the Legislature since 2003. Lamoureux first attempted to win a seat when he contested a by-election in Lloydminster but only collected 77 votes (2.7% of the total), barely enough for third place ahead of the Progressive Conservative candidate. In the 2016 general election, Lamoureux ran in the new constituency of Regina Pasqua, again finishing third albeit with a larger share of the vote (958 votes, 10.9%)."
