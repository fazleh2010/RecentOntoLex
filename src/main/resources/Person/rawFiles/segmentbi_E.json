His poems reflected his knowledge of modern and ancient languages, including Italian, French, English, Latin, Greek, Sumerian, and Akkadian. Most of Villa’s writing were printed by small publishing houses throughout Italy, and many are unavailable today. He translated the Babylonian creation epic, Enuma Elis, Homer’s Odyssey, and several books of the Hebrew Scriptures, including the first five books of Moses (Pentateuch), Job, Proverbs, and Song of Songs. In 1950, Villa moved to Brazil, where he became involved with the Brazilian \"concrete poets\" Haroldo de Campos and Augusto de Campos in São Paulo. He later returned to Rome where he got involved with the local art scene, working with artists such as Alberto Burri, Sante Monachesi, Mario Schifano and later Gino De Dominicis. He died in Rieti in 2003."

In 1974 he entered an inventor's contest and came second and that invention was the typewriter ribbon reinker for which he applied patent for and was granted. His most recent invention was the \"energized artificial leg.\" \"With this invention, a person without a leg can stand, walk, sit, or kneel with just a push of a lever. A draw strap connected to the waist and arms enables the person to walk. When the person walks, he or she swings the arms. Strings are attached to the hands, so when the arms swing back and forth, the motion creates tension, which moves the legs forward and so on.\" Tibay's more recent project is a perforated wall to run along the whole eastern coast of the Philippines called \"Typhoon Breaker.\""

  "text" : "Elizabeth \"Betty\" Peet McIntosh (March 1, 1915 – June 8, 2015) was known for her undercover work during World War II for the OSS (forerunner of the CIA). She was the daughter of two reporters and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. While in Hawaii, McIntosh studied and learned to speak Japanese. Just like her parents, she also became a reporter and returned to the Washington, D.C. area once World War II had begun in order to cover Eleanor Roosevelt and other government activities. In January 1943, she was asked to join the Office of Strategic Services because she had become fluent in Japanese. She was then sent to India where her main job was to intervene in the postcard communication that troops would send home to India while stationed in Japan. She became one of the few women assigned to Morale Operations where she created \"disinformation,\" or fake reports, documents and postcards which would \"undermine Japanese morale.\" After her time with the OSS, McIntosh published her memoir titled \"Undercover Girl\" in 1947. She wrote two children's books as well. In 1958, McIntosh began working for the CIA and worked there until she retired in 1973. She also wrote Sisterhood of Spies: The Women of the OSS, first published in 1998. In 2012, McIntosh was honored as one of the Library of Virginia's \"Virginia Women in History\". McIntosh died on June 8, 2015, in Lake Ridge, Virginia after a heart attack. She was 100 years old."

  "text" : "Eddie Norman Vanderdoes IV (born October 13, 1994) is an American football defensive tackle for the UCLA Bruins. Vanderdoes originally signed a National Letter of Intent in February 2013 to play college football with Notre Dame. However, he asked to be released due to family reasons and academic concerns, but Fighing Irish coach Brian Kelly refused to release him. Vanderdoes wanted to play for UCLA and appealed his case, which resulted in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) National Letter of Intent Appeals Committee granting him immediate eligibility to play for the Bruins. As a freshman in 2013, Vanderdoes was named first-team Freshman All-America by Sporting News and the Football Writers' Association. He played in all 13 games, starting in seven, and made 39 tackles. He even rushed for a touchdown on offense. In his sophomore year in 2014, Vanderdoes was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 selection for the second straight year after recording 50 tackles, 5 ½ tackles for a loss and two sacks. He also added another rushing touchdown. In the Bruins season opener in 2015, he tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee and was ruled out for the season. He had a team-high eight tackles in the 34–16 win over Virginia. His last play was on offense in a goal-line play, when he lifted 310-pound (140 kg) Kenny Clark and collapsed after his fellow defender had scored a 3-yard touchdown on the play. UCLA said Vanderdoes' knee had \"locked up on him\" earlier in the game, and did not suffer the injury during the celebration."

He was a founding dean, first athletic director, and important influence at the beginning of Orange County State College, which became California State University, Fullerton. According to the Orange County Register, Becker \"typed the first college catalog and launched the first student newspaper. He also staged an amazingly successful attention-getting event designed to put the young campus on the map: the 'First Intercollegiate Elephant Race in Human History,' held in 1962. It started as a joke but drew more than a dozen entries from universities around the world and was covered in 82 news publications. The elephants were rented from a Hollywood studio, and the largest was ridden by the editor of the Harvard University student newspaper, the Crimson.\" Becker started out at Orange County State College as the founding Dean of Students in 1959 when he first came to the school. He was an Emeritus Philosophy Professor. Becker was a major factor in choosing the school's athletic team nickname, the Titans. He was instrumental in starting and coaching the early years of Orange County State College(known now as Cal State Fullerton Titans Tennis) varsity men's tennis team at the school in the early 1960s. In Becker's younger days he was quite a practice player and tennis enthusiasts hitting tennis balls with the legendary tennis professional Bill Tilden according to his players on the team at Fullerton he loved talking about tennis."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Ewen was a scholar of women's history, immigration, and film. She was among the first feminist historians to write about early American cinema. Ewen was a professor of American Studies at the State University of New York at Old Westbury (SUNY). Noted film historian Robert Sklar described Ewen's 1980 article, “City Lights: Immigrant Women and the Rise of the Movies,” in Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, as 'the first significant writing by a historian on early American cinema to follow the author's and [Garth] Jowett's books.” Ewen's book, Immigrant Women in the Land of Dollars, examined the role of cinema in the lives of immigrant girls and women in New York City's Lower East Side. Filmmaker Ellen Noonan has explained that the book was the inspiration for the 1993 documentary Heaven Will Protect the Working Girl. Elizabeth Ewen authored several books with her husband, media historian Stuart Ewen, and her colleague Rosalyn Baxandall, including Channels of Desire: Mass Images and the Shaping of American Consciousness (1992), Picture Windows: How the Suburbs Happened (2000), Typecasting: On the Arts and Sciences of Human Inequality (2006). Ewen's work is frequently cited by contemporary historians. Elizabeth Ewen died May 29, 2012 in Manhattan, New York."

He lost it in 1926 to Paulino Uzcudun and retired from boxing the next year, though he briefly returned to the ring in 1934 and won all three of his final bouts. He returned to art after retiring from the ring. In October 1937 he debuted as an opera singer in Nel Trovatore in Turin. In the same year he also worked in sculpture and painting. In 1939 he acted in his first film, Io, suo padre by Mario Bonnard. This was followed by over fifty films and television series, including the war film Giarabub (1942). His last film was I fratelli Karamazov by Sandro Bolchi (1969). His elder brother Giuseppe was also a boxer."

Sometime over the course of WWII, all traces of Haffner were lost, including any professional and personal records that may have helped to indicate what led to his disappearance. There is just a single entry for him in the Berlin registry, where Haffner lived between 1925 and 1933. At the end of the 1930s, it is documented that he was summoned to appear at the Nazi Reichsschrifttumskammer (a writer’s union affiliated with the Third Reich), after which the details of his life remain unknown."

In 1877, he became a senior teacher at the Königliche Lehrerinnen-Seminar, and nine years later he was promoted to Intendantur-Rat, a military administrative authority, at the Royal Theater. In addition to his day job he developed an extensive literary work over the years, which attracted considerable attention from the public and literary criticism.

Throughout her childhood, she was surrounded by music and art. At the age of four, she showed promising talent in both painting and singing, and started learning the violin by the time she was twelve. She attended Otis Art Institute, where she met San Franciscan Nisei, Arthur Ishigo; they married in 1928. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Estelle and Arthur both lost their jobs, and Arthur was subsequently ordered to an internment camp. Estelle decided to follow him and they were both later assigned to Heart Mountain concentration camp in Wyoming. During their time at Heart Mountain, Estelle used her artwork to document their lives. After the war and their release from internment, Arthur and Estelle lived in poverty for many years. Following Arthur's death in 1957, fellow Heart Mountain inmates helped Ishigo republish her 1972 book Lone Heart Mountain. Estelle Ishigo died 25 February 1990 in Los Angeles, California."

He was the second son of Sir William Verner, Bt (1782–1871). Verner was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lisburn in 1863. He contested a by-election in February of that year, and was narrowly defeated by the Liberal Party candidate, industrialist John Doherty Barbour. However, that result was overturned on petition and at a second by-election in June he won the seat by 151 votes to Barbour's 90. Verner held the Lisburn seat until 1873. His elder brother William had been one of the two MPs for County Armagh, and on William's death Edward resigned his seat to stand in the by-election for Armagh. He was elected unopposed, and re-elected with a generous majority in 1874. He stood down at the 1874 general election, when his nephew William Edward was defeated by the Liberal candidate James Nicholson Richardson."

The precise date of his birth is not known: the directory of Cambridge University students identifies that he was aged 19 when he was admitted to Jesus College in February 1842, but also states that he was aged 72 at his death in 1896. Dowell batted and bowled in his first-class cricket matches, but neither his batting nor his bowling style is known. He played minor matches for Norfolk teams from 1844 through to 1870. He became a Church of England clergyman and was vicar of Dunton in Norfolk from 1855 to 1896. He had family cricketing connections: his daughter married Cambridge University and Surrey player Charles Tillard and their son, Elliot Dowell Tillard, played for Somerset and for teams in India."

  "text" : "Eberhard Klagemann (20 April 1904 – 20 March 1990) was a German film producer. During the 1930s, he worked for UFA as an assistant producer under Erich Pommer and later for 20th Century Fox's German subsidiary. Following the Second World War, Klagemann was issued a license to make films by Pommer, now Film Control Officer for the Allied occupiers of Germany. Pommer judged that he along with several other old colleagues had avoided becoming too closely involved with the Nazi regime: \"Certainly all of them have been proven to be no Nazis. Eberhard Klagemann seems to have been cleverly able to also stay away from the Nazis. He surely is an opportunist and therefore should be handled with care. Too bad, because he knows more about our business than all the others\". Klagemann set up a Munich-based firm Klagemann Film and was an important figure in post-war German cinema. He was president of the West German Film Producers' Association."

  "text" : "The Reverend Edward Spring (11 June 1808 - 29 April 1880) was an Anglo-Irish clergyman in the Church of Ireland, notable for his sermons and lectures on poor relief in Ireland. Spring was born at the family home of the The Point in Killarney, the son of Francis Spring, of Castlemaine and Catherine Fitzgerald. A descendant of Thomas Spring of Castlemaine, his family owned large estates in County Kerry. He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in 1833. Spring was ordained as a deacon on 30 November 1834 and became a priest exactly a year later, both at St Mary's Cathedral, Limerick. He was Curate of Killagha in 1834, Curate of Donneraile in 1835 and Curate of Killaconnenagha in 1837. In 1840 he was Curate of Dunnurlin, Curate of Tullagh in 1842 and in December 1849 became Curate of Cape Clear. Spring was made Rector of Kilcoe and Clear in 1852 and in 1864 became Vicar of Aghadown. In 1871 he became Rector of Magourney and Kilcolman in the Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross. He became well known in the 1840s due to his passionate sermons regarding poverty alleviation and food provision. This was especially the case during and after the Great Famine of 1845-1852. As a result, Spring was invited to give lectures across the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland about the Church's response to the disaster, many of which were later published and widely publicised by Purcell & Co. in Cork. Spring married Arabella Matilda Rudkin on 19 December 1844. Together they had four children: \n* Sir Francis Joseph Edward Spring  \n* Edward Maurice Day Spring \n* Catherine Anne Spring \n* Matilda Cecilia Spring He died at Magourney in 1880 at the age of 72."

  "text" : "Edward Archibald Bruce, known until August 1875 as Edward Archibald Brice (1 September 1849 – 14 November 1918) was an English cricketer who played first class cricket across six matches for Gloucestershire as a right-arm fast bowler. He took 20 wickets at a bowling average of 13.20, with two five wicket hauls, both taken in 1872. In non-first class cricket he made thirty appearances for Cheltenham College and Birkenhead Park and Somerset. He also served in the armed forces - stationed in Winchester. In August 1875 he changed his surname from Brice to Bruce, and scorecards after that date record his new surname. Born in Andhra Pradesh in British India, he died in Hove in Sussex."

Eddie Jackson was born on February 19, 1896 in Brooklyn, New York, USA as Edward Jacobs. He died on July 16, 1980 in Sherman Oaks, California, USA. He appeared in vaudeville with Jimmy Durante and Lou Clayton as the team Clayton, Jackson & Durante, known as the Three Sawdust Bums. Jackson began his show business work as a singing waiter at New York City and Coney Island clubs. At the Alamo Club in Harlem, he met Durante. They played together in a number of clubs and opened Club Durant in 1923. In 1924, their act was joined by Lou Clayton. The trio made their vaudeville debut at Loew's State theater in March 1927, with an act that literally included breaking up furniture. Durante sang of the virtues of wood, while Clayton and Jackson grabbed wood items and smashed them on the stage. By April 1928 they were headlining at the Palace Theater, breaking the house record for receipts, and making $5500 a week. They then moved to Broadway, appearing in the Ziegfeld production, Show Girl in 1929 and in Cole Porter's \"The New Yorkers\" in 1930. Jackson was known for his rousing rendition of \"Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey\" and for a dance step called the Strut. The trio broke up in 1931, though they did perform together in later years. Jackson remained Durante’s sidekick and often performed with him in clubs and on television until 1971. His television and film performances include All Star Revue (1950), The Jimmy Durante Show (1954) and Roadhouse Nights (1930). Jackson also recorded Dixieland jazz."

  "text" : "Eric Henry Monkkonen (August 17, 1942 in Kansas City, Missouri – May 30, 2005 in Culver City, California) was an American urban and social science historian who conducted authoritative studies on the history of crime as well as urban development. His work produced evidence that countered and overturned many assumptions, such as that crime rates are higher in urban areas, and increased during post-war periods and economic downturns. His works on the history of crime in several cities were extensive, cataloging close to every recorded homicide in New York City since 1798, and every homicide in Los Angeles since 1827, and conducting extensive studies on several more cities, primarily in the Western world. At one time he believed that murder was largely \"a problem of men\", and that \"If men take charge of anything ... it must be of the notion that real men don't kill, that self-respect means shrugging off an insult, and that the better manliness accrues to him who does not fight. Other countries have done this, and so can the United States.\""

  "text" : "Ernesto Treccani (1920 in Milan – 2009), Italian painter and intellectual. Born in Milan on August 26, 1920, he joined very early the art avant-garde groups and movements opposed to Fascist culture. Founder and director at the age of 18 of the magazine \"Corrente\" (cf. Corrente di Vita), he exhibited his first works at the \"Bottega di Corrente\" with Renato Birolli, Renato Guttuso, Giuseppe Migneco, Aligi Sassu and later with Bruno Cassinari and Ennio Morlotti at Galleria della Spiga and Corrente. His first personal exhibition, held at the Galleria Il Milione in Milan, where he exhibited many times during his artistic path, was in 1949. After the Resistance, he was leader of the \"Pittura\" group and editor of magazines such as Il 45 and Realismo, directed by Raffaele De Grada.In the 1950s his works have been selected for the Venice Biennale, as well as for the exhibition of the Realists held at the Leicester Galleries in London and in New York, where he exhibited with a personal show at the Heller Gallery.During this period the subjects of his paintings were influenced by his encounter with the rural situation in Calabria and by the urban industrial landscape of Milan and Paris, places where he returned repeatedly over the years.From the 1960s on, the prolific works and multiple initiatives demonstrate the continuous commitment of Treccani, characterized by a relentless action for the spread of culture and artistic debate. Among the works of this period, the five large paintings inspired by Pavese’s La luna e i falò (1962–63), the cycle of works Da Melissa a Valenza (1964–65), the series of watercolors inspired by a trip to Cuba; later, in 1976, major exhibitions of his work were held in Volgograd, at Pushkin Museum in Moscow and at Hermitage in Saint Petersburg. He held also many personal exhibitions in art galleries and museums in Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Stuttgart and São Paulo.Treccani then developed the various features of his artistic research along parallel lines, continuing to work and exhibit in towns and cities in Italy and abroad, and alternating this “wandering” activity with regular and creative stays in Macugnaga and Forte dei Marmi, places to which the artist was strongly attached in life and painting. In 1978 he founded the Fondazione Corrente, a center for cultural events, exhibitions and debates in the various fields of culture and art, as well as a center for the collection and study of documents related to the period between the birth of the movement and the years of Realism. Treccani was also writer and poet; among his texts, the books Arte per amore, Il segreto dell’arte and Un poco di fiele: poesie e disegni (1940–1970). In 1989 the City of Milan held a major retrospective exhibition on the artist at the Royal Palace, and another large retrospective of his works was held at Foundation Bandera in Busto Arsizio in 2003.In 2004 he created the cycle of large windows Energia, luci e colori, shown in Lugano, Riga, Budapest and Prague. In 2006 the town of Forte dei Marmi organized the exhibition at the Fortino Le mutazioni del realismo - Opere inedite 2003-06, the result of a renewed search for forms that has its center in color. In 2008, again at Royal Palace, Treccani participated in the exhibition Corrente, le parole della vita. Opere 1930–1945, with a room set aside for his paintings of that period. A large retrospective exhibition inaugurated the renovated rooms of Palazzo Barberini in Montichiari in May 2009, just a few months before his death, which took place on November 27, 2009, in his beloved House of Swallows. In December 2009, during the 40th anniversary of the Piazza Fontana bombing, the painting Un popolo di volti was exhibited at the Royal Palace in Milan.In March 2011, again at the Royal Palace, the painting Le cinque giornate di Milano was exhibited on the occasion of the 150th Anniversary of the Unification of Italy.Among the recent exhibitions, there are mentioned: in 2012 Le parole e la pittura. Ernesto Treccani incontra la poesia, l’epica, il romanzo at the Pinacoteca Civica of Savona and in 2013 La materia e la luce. Vetri, ceramiche e smalti di Ernesto Treccani at the Fondazione Corrente."

  "text" : "Edward Franks Hodgson (28 August 1813 – 9 March 1882) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played in first-class cricket matches for Cambridge University in 1835 and 1836. He was born in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire and died at Holton cum Beckering in Lincolnshire. Hodgson's role as a cricketer is not clear: he both opened the batting and batted as low as No 10 in the batting order in his three first-class games, one of which was the 1836 University Match against Oxford University; there is no evidence that he bowled in major cricket. In six first-class innings, he scored just 18 runs."

Three of his matches were the University matches against Oxford University in 1855, 1857 and 1858; his record in these games was not distinguished, but in other matches, he twice took six wickets in an innings.

He is known to have been reluctant to take up this offfice, probably because it would involve him in heavy expenses, and he did so only after King Richard II issued a warrant commanding de Clay, along with two other leading advocates, John Hill and Sir John Cary, to be admitted to that rank by a specified day. In 1385 he was sent to Ireland with a large retinue to take up office as Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. He was transferred to the more senior office of Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1386. He had returned to England and was living on his estates in Nottinghamshire by 1389; later he is recorded as sitting on a commission of oyer and terminer. His date of death is not recorded,"

Soon afterwards he came to Melbourne, and having good letters of introduction from the great Earl of Derby and others, he was, within a fortnight of his landing, made Chairman of Quarter Sessions and Commissioner of the Court of Bequests. Brewster was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1839. Around 1841 Brewster was one of the first six barristers admitted to the Port Phillip bar (along with Robert Pohlman, Redmond Barry, James Croke, Archibald Cuninghame and James Murray). Brewster was elected to New South Wales Legislative Council as member for Port Phillip District (later to become the separate colony of Victoria) on 1 January 1846, a position he held until 1 February 1848. On his return to England Brewster went up to Oxford in 1853, studied for the Anglican ministry, and was ordained the same year. He was later vicar of Ampney Crucis, Gloucester, and Leyton, Essex. Brewster died in Cape Town, South Africa on his way to re-visit Australia. One newspaper put his age at death at 83."

  "text" : "Born in Alassio, Savona, Simonetti graduated in piano at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory in Rome. A lover of jazz, in the early 1950s he founded a musical jazz band with Piero Piccioni and Bruno Martino, with whom he performed in the most important nightclubs of the time. In 1953 he moved with his family to Brasil, where he got an immediate success as musician, composer and also entertainer, hosting a long running television program, Simonetti Show, lasted 147 episodes; thanks to his popularity he was made an honorary citizen of Brazil, and introduced into the \"Candido Randon da Silva\" order. In 1964 he came back in Italy, where he joined RAI television, making his debut in the show Chitarra, amore mio. He was active as a television and radio host (often in couple with Isabella Biagini), a film composer, and even an occasional actor. Simonetti died at age 54, as a result of complications following a major surgical operation to remove a tumor in the throat. His film scores include Macumba Love (1960), Special Killers (1973), Il magnate (1973) and Per amore di Cesarina (1976). He was the father of composer and musician Claudio Simonetti."

  "text" : "Colonel Eustace James Anthony Balfour (8 June 1854 – 14 February 1911) was a London-based Scottish architect. The brother of one British Prime Minister and nephew of another, his career was built on family connections. His mother was the daughter of a Marquess, and his wife Frances, a noted suffragist, was the daughter of a Duke. Frances's sister in-law was Princess Louise, daughter of the reigning Queen Victoria. Balfour's initial work was on English and Scottish country houses, but he won only one major commission in this field. However, his appointment as surveyor of the Grosvenor Estate in London gave him architectural control over much of Mayfair and Belgravia in the 1890s and 1900s, and the opportunity to design many buildings himself. Balfour was a senior officer of the Volunteer Force in London. His outspokenness on military matters was a factor in his appointment as an aide-de-camp to King Edward VII. A fastidious and somewhat withdrawn individual, Balfour succumbed to alcoholism in his fifties. This brought about his early death."

After an initial career as classical singer, he gradually specialized in restoring tradited Austrian folksongs and original medieval music from Europe, such as the German epic Nibelungenlied or medieval Minnelieder."

He was born in London and died at Maidstone, Kent. As a cricketer, Dyke was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a left-arm medium pace bowler. It was as a bowler that he made an immediate impression in his only first-class match of 1864: he took 10 Marylebone Cricket Club wickets for 41 runs in the game, including 6 for 14 in the second innings. He was unable to repeat this success in four first-class games for Cambridge in 1865: these included the University match against Oxford University in which he took a single wicket and failed to score in either innings. His single game for MCC in 1866 was his most successful with the bat, with a score of 46 in the second innings."

  "text" : "Emily Inez Denny (December 23, 1853 - August 23, 1918) was a painter who drew scenes from Seattle's early history. Her parents were Seattle pioneers David Denny (1832-1903) and Louisa Boren Denny (1827-1916), who came to Seattle from Cherry Grove, Illinois over the Oregon Trail. She survived the Battle of Seattle in 1856 and later painted the event as well as many landscapes and nature scenes from the region. The Museum of History & Industry (MOHAI) in Seattle holds the largest collection of her works. In 1909 she wrote a book describing the early history of Seattle and the Puget Sound region. In 2007, her painting \"Panoramic View of the Olympic Mountains\" was displayed for the first time in 121 years, at the Museum of History and Industry."

  "text" : "The Right Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Henry Cooper (1827 – 26 February 1902) was an Irish officer in the British Army, a landlord in County Sligo, and a Conservative politician. At the age of 36 the Dublin-born soldier inherited Markree Castle in County Sligo from his uncle, and left the army to manage his country estate. As one of the major landlords in the county, he assumed many of the roles which still accompanied that status. He promptly became a local magistrate, and in 1865 was returned unopposed by the county to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. Having followed five previous Cooper landlords of Markree to serve as Member of Parliament (MP) for Sligo, his unpopularity as a landlord led to his defeat in 1868, after one term. He then reactivated his uncle's Markree Observatory, and commissioned archaeological drawings of County Sligo. He served as the Lord Lieutenant of Sligo for the 25 years until his death, and for the last three as a Privy Councillor."

  "text" : "Edward \"Ted\" Ernest Hollamby OBE (8 January 1921 – 29 December 1999) was an English architect, town planner, and architectural conservationist. Known for designing a number of modernist housing estates in London, he also achieved notability for his work in restoring Red House, the Arts and Crafts building in Bexleyheath, Southeast London which was designed by William Morris and Philip Webb in 1859. Born in Hammersmith, West London, Hollamby served in the Royal Marines during the Second World War before embarking on a career in architecture. Involved with the Communist Party of Great Britain and other leftist groups, his socialist beliefs led him to work in the public sector, first for the Miners' Welfare Commission and then for London County Council (LCC), where he was involved in the design and construction of such modernist post-war housing estates as Bethnal Green's Avebury Estate, Kennington's Brandon Estate, and Deptford's Pepys Estate. In 1952, Hollamby and his family moved into the Red House, embarking on projects to renovate and restore it. A great fan of the house's original inhabitant, he also involved himself in the early activities of the William Morris Society, which held a number of meetings at the property. Awarded an OBE for his career in 1970, from 1969 to 1981 Hollamby worked as Director of Architecture, Planning and Development for the London Borough of Lambeth, before moving to work for the London Docklands Development Corporation from 1981 to 1985. He continued restoring Red House in later life, opening it up to visitors and establishing the Friends of Red House charity in 1998. The Guardian described Hollamby as \"very much an architect of the 20th century, a public servant who believed not just in high quality architecture but in the existence and nurturing of the public realm, of public architecture and civic design.\""

Though the original wild hop died during the winter of 1918–19, Brewer's Gold has become the ancestor of nearly every new high-alpha hop variety released since then. Salmon was born in Richmond, Surrey, England in 1871 and held a number of research and teaching positions through his life. He was a researcher at the Kew Gardens from 1899 to 1906 and at Wye College from 1906 to 1937. Salmon was elected as the President of the British Mycological Society in 1911, he was appointed as a Reader in mycology at London University in 1912 and was promoted to a full professorship there in 1925. Salmon did not marry and lived for most of his life in the village of Wye. He died in a Folkestone nursing home on October 12, 1959."

  "text" : "Emil B. Fischer (1838 or 1839 in Dresden, Saxony – September 23, 1898 in Silverton, Colorado) published six detailed maps of the San Juan area of southwestern Colorado between 1883 and 1898. A surveyor’s son, he came to America around 1872. He moved to Durango in 1880 when the building of the Denver & Rio Grande Railway to the San Juan attracted widespread attention, then to Silverton. These maps aided silver and gold prospectors to file their claims; they enabled investors to locate mines and view their proximity to famous neighboring mines; and they encouraged tourists to visit the depicted mining regions and invigorate the local economies. This quiet, unobtrusive German immigrant made many mountain-climbing pilgrimages for his meticulous drawings of San Juan and adjacent counties, which he subsequently transferred to maps that were as attractive as they were functional. Fischer drew his finished maps, even the text elements, entirely by hand before engraving and printing, distinguishing them from the typeset variety that came before and after. They are scrupulously correct in detail and were regarded as authoritative for many years. The complex terrain of the San Juan area, characterized by precipitous peaks ranging from 11,000 to 14,000 feet, rugged passes, deep gorges, alpine valleys, and glacial basins, rendered accurate maps indispensable for miners and created a niche for this cartographer. Following are descriptions of Fischer’s six maps: 1. 1883, “Map of the San Juan Mining Districts.” It includes insets with plats of the towns of Durango, Silverton, and Rico. The scale is one inch to three miles. 2. 1886, “Map of Red Mountain and the Mining Region of San Juan, Ouray, San Miguel and Dolores Counties.” A small inset shows the system of wagon roads connecting the towns of Telluride and Ouray with Montrose. The scale is one inch to one mile. 3. 1891, “Map of Red Mountain and the Mining Region of San Juan, Ouray, San Miguel and Dolores Counties,” intended to update its predecessor with the identical name and scale. Inset plats focus on these three mining locales: Newman Hill at Rico, the Red Mountain Area north of Silverton, and Silver Lake in Arrastra Basin, east of Silverton. The map shows the locations of hundreds of the San Juan Region’s named mines and placers and may constitute a comprehensive compilation. 4. 1893, “Map of Southwestern Colorado.” The scale is one inch to four miles. It covers the huge expanse of this part of the state as well as northwestern New Mexico and southeastern Utah. Insets portray plats of Durango, southwestern Colorado’s California Mining District, and the Needle Mountain Mines between Durango and Silverton, as well as the network of railroad systems reaching Durango from Cheyenne, Denver, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, and Phoenix. 5. 1894, “Map of the Mineral Section of San Miguel County,” attached to a booklet published by the Telluride Board of Trade, based on his 1891 map, showing this county only with the scale of one inch to one mile. 6. 1898, “The Principal Mining Section of San Juan County.” This map updates Fischer’s 1891 map, but smaller in scope, with a superlative scale of one and a half inches to one mile. Fischer produced these six maps, except the 1894 and possibly the 1898, as “pocket maps,” i.e., they came folded and packaged in printed enclosures for safe, easy transport. The public may view originals of these maps at a number of locations in the U.S., principally in Colorado. The Denver Public Library houses all six. Other locations include the Colorado School of Mines, Colorado College, Fort Lewis College, University of Colorado-Denver, Pike’s Peak Library District, San Juan County Historical Society Archives, Yale University, Columbia University-City of New York, Brigham Young University, the University of Nevada-Reno, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Southern Methodist University, Autry Institute for the Study of the American West, and the Library of Congress. Fischer’s artistic gifts bore fruit through his paintings and sketches as well as his maps. The most famous, painted in 1895, depicts Francis Marion Snowden’s cabin, the first in Baker’s Park, where Silverton now stands. In 2013 the San Juan County Historical Society acquired this painting for its Silverton museum. In late-2014, color images of Fischer’s six maps, his 1895 painting, and his grave marker will be available on the Mining History Association’s website: www.mininghistoryassociation.org. Emil B. Fischer died September 23, 1898, at the age of 59, of “paralysis of the heart.” He collapsed on the sidewalk in front of the First National Bank of Silverton, where he had just transacted business. Reportedly his only known survivor was a sister in Dresden. Although the details of his decline are poorly documented, it appears Emil Fischer died alone and relatively poor despite his notable abilities. His six maps and his paintings showcase the rich mining history of the San Juan. Unlike the maps of his predecessors, contemporaries, or the USGS that followed, his combined aesthetic flair with accurate cartography, making his work unique and creating a market for it more than a century after he died. California rare-map dealer Barry Ruderman recently sold one of his 1893 maps for $6,500."

  "text" : "Ezra Yitzhak Nawi (Hebrew: עזרא יצחק נאווי‎‎; born 1952) is an Israeli Mizrahi Jew, left-wing, human rights activist and pacifist. He is particularly active among the Bedouin herders and farmers of the South Hebron Hills and against the establishment of Israeli settlements there, in what Uri Avnery describes as a protracted effort by settlers to cleanse the area of Arab villagers, in the prevention of which he has played a key role. He has been described as a \"Ta'ayush nudnik\", and \"a working-class, liberal gay version of Joe the Plumber\". He is regarded by some as an extreme leftist activist and troublemaker. He has been charged with numerous infractions of the law, with convictions ranging from statutory rape, illegal use of a weapon and possession of drugs to assaulting two policemen, In addition, he has also served several short stints in prison as a consequence of his activism. Defenders claim that many of the prosecutions are politically motivated. According to David Shulman, he is considered a major obstacle to the theft of Palestinian land and he is an Israeli exponent of Gandhian civil disobedience. Nawi has said that he strikes back when attacked. He came to international attention after being convicted in 2007 of participating in a riot and assaulting two police officers in connection with the demolition of Bedouin homes in the West Bank by Israeli border policemen. His trial and imprisonment spurred a world-wild protest against his treatment that elicited 20,000 signatures. In 2015, an undercover pro-settler group taped him bragging that he had identified Palestinian land brokers willing to sell land to Israeli or Jewish brokers to the PA security services. Under Palestinian law, such sales are a capital offence, and Nawi claimed they would be tortured and killed. The case triggered a political backlash in Israel and there were calls for England and France to stop foreign funding of two Israeli civil rights NGOs, Ta'ayush and B'Tselem, whose members were involved in the incident. Nawi and two others were arrested, and then released and banned from the West Bank for two weeks. In 2008, Nissim Mossek produced a film on his life, private and public, which has had mixed reviews."

He was not notably successful in any of his first-class matches and his highest score in nine innings was just 15; he was not selected for the University Match against Oxford University in any of his Cambridge seasons. Kirwan's younger brother, John, was very much more successful in his cricket career and played alongside him in a few Cambridge games from 1836. In the first of the matches in which both Kirwans appeared, John Kirwan took 15 wickets against Cambridge Town Club."

  "text" : "Edward \"Ned\" Kendall (March 1, 1808 in Fort Wolcott, Goat Island, Rhode Island – October 26, 1861 in Boston) was a bandleader and musician who played the keyed bugle. He was known for his Boston Brass Band, itself a pioneer in all-brass bands, and for a trumpet-playing showdown with the former leader of the Boston Brigade Band, Patrick Gilmore. He was also known for his silver bugle, a gift from Queen Victoria. Kendall formed or took leadership of the Boston Brass Band in 1835, at a time when band instruments were changing. He played the keyed bugle, an instrument first made by Nathan Adams of Lowell, Massachusetts, c. 1825. The instruments had become popular with bands very soon, and were common by 1830. Ned was considered among the best on his chosen instrument, and his death seen as the \"end of an era\" for the instrument, as the valved cornet took over in the bands. One of Kendall's instruments, a keyed bugle made H. Sibley, Boston, was given to the Library of Congress."

  "text" : "Edward Somerton (died 1461) was an Irish barrister and judge who held the offices of Serjeant-at-law (Ireland) and judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). He was born in Ireland, but little else is known of his personal life before c, 1427 when he is recorded as being in London, where he was studying law at Lincoln's Inn. He returned to Ireland and was appointed King's Serjeant in 1437; he also acted as counsel for the city of Waterford. His period as Serjeant, then the Crown's senior legal adviser, was one of great political turbulence, marked by fierce conflict between the rival Butler and Talbot factions, and his name appears frequently in the Patent Rolls in connection with the various controversies. He was a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. In that capacity he \"spoke as the mouth of the Council\" at its meeting at Trim, County Meath on 5 June 1442, when Richard Wogan, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, a prominent member of the Talbot faction, was questioned about certain articles he had sent to the Parliament of England denouncing his political enemy, James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormonde, the head of the Butler faction. After the Council, in Wogan's absence, had examined the articles, Somerton, who was described as the Prolocutor of the Privy Council, declared that the Council found the charges against Ormonde to be false, and further declared that Wogan had acted without their authority in sending the articles to the English Parliament. In 1447 he was appointed a judge of the Court of King's Bench. In 1457 he asked for permission to found a chantry at the Church of St. Nicholas Within, Dublin. He died in 1461."

Wallace also started churches in Ashland, Oregon; Boise, Idaho, Walla Walla, Washington and Seattle, Washington. She became district superintendent, the first woman to hold that post, and the last until 1988."

Born in Catania into an upper-middle-class family, the nephew of author Giuseppe Villaroel, Patti started working as a journalist at very young age, before graduating in law in 1925. After practicing for a year in his father's firm, he decided to move to Rome where earning a living from journalism. There, after some sporadic collaborations, he was employed in the newspaper Gazzetta del Popolo, where he was a foreign correspondent in China, India and Japan, among other places. He got notoriety as a novelist in 1940, with Quartieri alti, a satirical portrait of Roman high classes. His novels are mainly set in Rome or in a sensual Sicily, which was, according to literary critic Carlo Bo, a sort of philosophical ideal for Patti. Patti was active as a screenwriter since 1935, and a number of his novels were adapted into films. In addition to novels Patti published collections of short stories and two autobiographical works."

Shepard was married to Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt, who was the granddaughter of philanthropist, business magnate, and family patriarch Cornelius Vanderbilt. Shepard's Briarcliff Manor residence Woodlea and the Scarborough Presbyterian Church, which he founded nearby, are contributing properties to the Scarborough Historic District. Shepard was born in Jamestown, New York, one of three sons of the president of a banknote-engraving company. He attended the City University of New York, and practiced law for about 25 years. During the American Civil War, Shepard was a Union Army recruiter and earned the rank of colonel. He was later a founder and benefactor of several institutions and banks. When Shepard moved to the Briarcliff Manor hamlet of Scarborough-on-Hudson, he founded the Scarborough Presbyterian Church and built Woodlea; the house and its land are now part of Sleepy Hollow Country Club."

  "text" : "Edward Wynell Mayow Lloyd (19 March 1845 – 27 September 1928) was an English schoolmaster and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) between 1866 and 1868. He was born at Benares, India and died at Hartford Bridge, Hartley Wintney, Hampshire. Lloyd was educated at Rugby School and at St John's College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a middle-order right-handed batsman, and he was tried for matches for Cambridge University in both 1866 and 1868 – in one of the 1868 games, he played for the MCC against the university side – but he achieved little and was not awarded a Blue. He continued to play in minor matches after leaving Cambridge and appeared for both the Shropshire and Somerset teams in non-first-class matches, including one game for Somerset in 1879 that is the basis of disputes about the cricket career statistics of W. G. Grace (see Variations in first-class cricket statistics). In one of these minor matches featuring many of the players who were instrumental in the setting up of Somerset County Cricket Club, Lloyd made an unbeaten 100 for the Gentlemen of Somerset against the Gentlemen of Dorset. On leaving Cambridge, he became a schoolmaster at Marlborough College from 1868 to 1875 and was then the headmaster of a preparatory school, Hartford House School, at Hartley Wintney until his retirement in 1910. A brief obituary in The Times in 1928 states that was \"one of the most successful private schoolmasters in the country\" and that he achieved many scholarships at public schools, principally at Marlborough, for his pupils."

She took up the piano at the age of three, and was a child prodigy. In 1888 she enrolled at the Stuttgart Conservatory in Germany. In 1890 she was awarded a pianoforte scholarship at the Royal College of Music, but declined and instead studied at Harrow Music School under John Farmer, and then at the Royal High School for Music in Berlin. Her patron there was Marie Benecke, eldest daughter of Felix Mendelssohn. She spent many years in South Africa, where she performed professionally on the piano well into her senior years. In 1958 (at age 80) she made a well received tour of South Africa with Dutch violinist Herman Salomon, who had previously gained his reputation as leader of The Amsterdam string Quartet. She appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 28 April 1969. She died on 27 June 1976 at Wynberg, South Africa, and was buried at Hout Bay Cemetery."

  "text" : "Ernst Plassmann (14 June 1823 – 28 November 1877; alternate spelling, Plassman) was a German-American sculptor and carver. Born in Sondern, near Wuppertal, North Rhine-Westphalia, Plassmann began to study art under Munstermann, then continued his studies in Aachen, Cologne, and finally in Paris, where he spent about four years in the studio of Michel Liénard. He moved to New York City in 1853, and in 1854 established \"Plassmann's School of Art\", which he ran the rest of his life. In 1858 he founded the \"Verein fur Kunst und Wissenschaft\" (Association for Art and Science). In New York he became known for his statue of Benjamin Franklin (1870–1) in Printing House Square, depicted as a printer by including an issue of the Pennsylvania Gazette in his left hand. Plassmann spent months researching Franklin busts, portraits, and costumes, and he \"labored conscientiously for several months\" on the \"colossal\" clay statue, which was inaugurated on 17 January 1872. His figures of Franklin and Guttenberg are located on the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung building (c.1873). The heroic statue of Chief Tammany, a legendary Delaware Indian chief, is part of the façade of Tammany Hall on 14th Street (1868/9), while the 1869 8.5 feet (2.6 m) bronze of Cornelius Vanderbilt is located at the south façade of Midtown Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal. A Plassmann sculpture stands in the freight depot of the New York Central Railroad (1870), aside from various metal works, including medals. In 1875 he published Modern Gothic Ornaments with 83 plates. He began publishing Designs for Furniture in 1877, and had completed three parts by the time of his death (in New York City)."

  "text" : "Edmund Cieczkiewicz (1872-1958) was a Polish painter and graphic designer. Best known for his Romantic landscapes, he is often dubbed \"the last student of Matejko\". Born in Barszczowice near Lwów (modern Lviv, then in Austro-Hungarian Galicia), Cieczkiewicz graduated from a gymnasium in Nowy Sącz and in 1887 joined the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts. There he studied painting under the tutelage of Florian Cynk, Władysław Łuszczkiewicz and Leon Wyczółkowski, as well as Jan Matejko and Teodor Axentowicz. He graduated in 1898, along his better-known colleagues: Józef Mehoffer, Stanisław Wyspiański, Xawery Dunikowski and Wojciech Weiss. Although a skilled painter, his personal situation prevented him from devoting his life solely to art. Instead upon graduation he started working for Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways as a railway clerk. He continued to paint though, notably portraits and mountain landscapes of the Beskides and Tatra Mountains, as well as Volhynia and Białowieża Forest. Among the best-known of his works are a series of paintings adorning the train stations of Tarnów and Nowy Sącz (finished around 1910). The Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways were so impressed with the series that it ordered a similar series of Alpine landscapes for the Salzburg Hauptbahnhof, however the outbreak of World War I prevented their completion. Apart from paintings, Cieczkiewicz also painted a series of promotional posters for the 1929 Polish General Exhibition in Poznań (1929) and numerous postcards. After the war Cieczkiewicz retired and settled in Wierchomla before moving to Kamionka Wielka, Piwniczna and finally to Rytro, where he spent the remainder of his life. He died 31 January 1958 in Rytro and was buried at the local Catholic cemetery."

  "text" : "Edward G. Leffingwell (December 3, 1941 – August 5, 2014) was an American art critic and curator, affiliated with MoMA/P.S.1 and Art in America and associated with avant-garde art. Leffingwell was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, on December 3, 1941. In the mid-1960s he moved to New York City and began associating with Max's Kansas City and the Warhol Factory crowd. During the 1960s and 1970s he was involved with a variety of avant-garde art projects, including a 1969 film by sculptor John Chamberlain (\"The Secret Life of Hernando Cortez\"). In the late 1970s Leffingwell left New York to take care of his mother, who was ill, and began to transition to a curatorial career in the arts. He entered Youngstown State University, completing a B.A. in 1982, and went on in 1984 to earn an M.A. in art history from the University of Cincinnati. In 1985 he was hired by PS1, now affiliated with New York's Museum of Modern Art. Leffingwell organized a number of key exhibitions, including two while he was in school. His first exhibition, in 1983, was at the Butler: \"Chinese Chance: An American Collection\", which profiled the collection of Leffingwell's long-time associate, Mickey Ruskin, who had been one of the owners of Max's Kansas City. His next major exhibition was at the University of Cincinnati, reviewing Lawrence Weiner, a conceptual artist. Over the next several years Leffingwell organized several significant shows. In New York, he developed a 20-year retrospective of sculptor John McCracken (\"John McCracken: Heroic Stance\") and a 1987 show of artist Michael Tracy (\"Michael Tracy: Terminal Privileges\"). In 1997 at P.S.1 he organized a retrospective of the work of artist and filmmaker Jack Smith (\"Jack Smith: Flaming Creature: His Amazing Life and Times\"). He also organized a show on James Rosenquist, and \"About Place: Contemporary American Landscape\" (1986). Leffingwell spent four years in Los Angeles, directing the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery at Barnsdall Park from 1988 to 1992. There he organized an exhibition of George Herms, and a proposed biennial show, LAX: The Los Angeles Exhibition, a contemporary art exhibition spanning seven to eight institutions. During this time Leffingwell became interested in and associated with Brazilian art and the São Paulo Art Biennial. For that biennial, he organized a show on the painter Neil Williams, one of long-time friends and associates. Leffingwell wrote prolifically, penning hundreds of reviews and critical essays for Art in America, as well as contributing to scholarship on artist Lawrence Weiner, photographer Joe Deal, artist Judith Murray, Claude Monet and Jack Smith. Leffingwell died from cardiac arrest in Flushing, Queens, on August 5, 2014, at the age of 72, after suffering from Parkinson's disease."

  "text" : "Ercole Gennari (10 March 1597 - 27 June 1658) was an Italian Renaissance drawer and painter. Son of the painter Benedetto Gennari and Julia Bovi, Ercole was baptized in the collegiate church of San Biagio, in Cento. He originally studied to be a surgeon. However his lifetime association with the painter Guercino, including the marrying his sister Lucia in 1628, and the guidance and influence of his father and his older brother the painter Bartolomeo Gennari (1594-1661), led Ercole to choose the profession of painter. His style puts him in the Bolognese School of painting. He painted Madonna and Child with St. Felix of Cantalice and Trinity with Saints Ursula, Francesco and Antonio, preserved in the Pinacoteca Comunale di Cesena. After the death of Paul Anthony, the brother of Guercino who was the assistant principal and administrator of the painting workshop, Ercole went to live with his wife and sons Benedetto and Cesare, in Bologna, in the house of Guercino, who, without a family of his own, needed someone to maintain the relationships with customers and administer the property, which he bequeathed to the young grandchildren to whom he had also taught him to paint. Ercole Gennari was buried in the family chapel of the Bolognese church of St. Nicholas of Albari."

After leaving the service, Tsikerdanos joined CIA and was assigned to Taiwan where he ran cross-channel reconnaissance and harassment operations into Red China from Nationalist-held islands. He served multiple tours in Greece, and later was entrusted with the difficult assignment of cleaning up the large mess of internal \"dirt\" files collected over twenty-five years by the paranoid former CIA Chief, James Jesus Angleton, after Angleton's forced retirement. After his own retirement, Tsikerdanos returned to CIA as a Contract Case Officer, working with distinction in the Agency's Counterterrorism Center for several years. He was personally engaged against some of the most dangerous terrorist suspects in Europe. He died on 8 December 1997 at the age of 73, after being diagnosis with cancer."

  "text" : "Emanuel Raymond Lewis (Ray Lewis), was the longest serving and final House Librarian for the United States House of Representatives Library in the U.S. Capitol Building. He was appointed House Librarian in 1973, and served in this position until January 1995, at which time the library, along with the House Historical Office, were reorganized and placed under the new Legislative Resource Center, a division of the Office of the Clerk. The House Library predated the Library of Congress, serving as the official repository of Congressional documents generated by the U.S. House of Representatives since 1792. Other House librarians included Calvin Clifford Chaffee, a physician and abolitionist who represented Springfield, Massachusetts as a congressman during the 34th and 35th Congresses from 1855 to 1859. Chaffee's political career suffered after he and the public learned in 1857 that his wife, Irene Sanford Emerson, owned several slaves, including the enslaved American Dred Scott. After his stint as a congressman, Chaffee served as house librarian during the 36th Congress, from until 1859 - 1861. William H. Smith, the first African American to hold this position, served as librarian during the 47th Congress (1881-1883). In 1971 Lewis was called to testify before a subcommittee of the U.S. House Interior Committee during hearings on creating the Golden Gate National Recreation Area from land previously used as military bases. His testimony was instrumental in the preservation of over 80,000 acres of land in the San Francisco bay area for recreational use. As a historian, Dr. Lewis had extensive knowledge of military installations in this region. Dr. Lewis had previously been commissioned by the State of California State to prepare \"A History of San Francisco Harbor Defense Installations: Forts Baker, Barry,Cronkite, and Funston\". During the House Judiciary Committee’s impeachment hearings on President Nixon in July of 1974, Lewis provided critical historical references to guide the committee in its work, during its hearings for the impeach the President, the first impeachment hearing for a president since that of Andrew Johnson in 1869."

Her first book 'Chocolate Burnout' goes on to embrace multi-cultural heritage, which is recognized in the Mavin foundation database of books by authors who touch on interracial relationships. La-Paz also wrote Why Do Married Men Cheat with Unattractive Women? In April 2011. A story based on real life events about a beautiful supermodel that becomes baffled when her husband leaves her for a so-called \"unattractive woman\". The book based on the original blog transitions into the novel, which follows the main character Judie, as she tries to move on after her bitter and very public break-up, which played out through the media, right before the Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mildred Baena scandal in May 2011."

  "text" : "Edward Alexander Partridge (5 November 1861 – 3 August 1931) was a Canadian teacher, farmer, agrarian radical, businessman and author. He was born in Ontario but moved to Saskatchewan where he taught and then became a farmer. He was active in the Territorial Grain Growers' Association (TGGA), founded in 1902, which addressed various problems with the Western Canada grain market. He founded the cooperative Grain Growers' Grain Company, the predecessor of the United Grain Growers, and the Grain Growers' Guide, a widely distributed weekly paper. His \"Partridge Plan\" was a broad and visionary proposal for addressing a wide range of farmers' issues, eliminating many abuses caused by the near-monopoly of grain elevator companies, and resulted in important reforms by the provincial governments."

He is an established guest director at Toneelgroep Amsterdam and Schauspielhaus Bochum in Germany, and has directed for Theater Dortmund. At Toneelgroep Amsterdam he directs plays predominantly from an Anglo-Sakson repertoire. For the German theaters, he elects plays from a repertoire of Dutch works instead. His plays are a reflection on current socio-political issues, in the form of a satire. His plays are hyper realistic, where humor and earnesty are intertwined.His most ambitious and famous work is the mightysociety-project, started in 2004. The National Theatre (Nationale Toneel) in The Hague appointed Eric de Vroedt as their new artistic leader. He will take up his position in September 2016."

He was born at Offley, Hertfordshire and died near Godstone, Surrey. McNiven was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. At Eton, he played in the Eton v Harrow cricket matches of 1843 and 1844 primarily as a bowler. Between 1846 and 1848, he appeared in several matches for Cambridge University, playing largely as a right-handed lower middle-order batsman; he played in the 1846 University Match against Oxford University but was not picked for the matches in 1847 or 1848. His best batting came in a match against a side calling itself \"Cambridge Townsmen\" in 1848, when he was unbeaten on 88 when the university innings ended. McNiven did not play any first-class cricket in 1849 or in 1850, the year he graduated from Cambridge University, but in 1851 he played four games inside a month for four different teams: the Marylebone Cricket Club, Surrey, the Gentlemen in the annual Lord's Gentlemen v Players fixture, and the Gentlemen of England team. Those were his final appearances in major cricket. McNiven became a lawyer and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1849. He was killed \"near Westerham\" when his dog cart overturned in January 1858; the family home at the time was Perrysfield, near Godstone, and in some references this is given as the place of death."

Inspired by spiritual evolution, she divined with a pendulum and created her drawings by radiesthesia. Said one scholar, in comparing her to other women artists, \"Hilma af Klint, Agnes Martin, and Emma Kunz approached geometric abstraction not as formalism, but as a means of structuring philosophical, scientific, and spiritual ideas. Using line, geometry, and the grid, each of these artists created diagrammatic drawings of their exploration of complex belief systems and restorative practices.\""

Maureen Warner-Lewis writes that the fact that \"Lazare appropriated, or condoned the use of, an overtly African designation....was a symbol of his identification with black people and the poor. He was a defender of their rights, joined the Pan-African Association founded in 1901 in England by fellow Trinidadian Henry Sylvester Williams, and became a moving spirit behind democratic political reforms at the turn of the twentieth century.\""

  "text" : "Erin Rachel Hudak (born 1978) is a multi-media artist currently residing in Brooklyn, New York. She began her career as an assistant to David Levinthal. Born in Stow, Ohio, Ms. Hudak creates collages, paintings and sculptures that represent ideas of freedom, power, perception and transformation. Hudak’s artwork often depicts images of nature juxtaposed with images of civilization. Ms. Hudak received her B.F.A from the Savannah College of Art and Design and attended Allegheny College for art and literature. Her work has exhibited nationally, and been featured in press internationally, including Vogue Girl Korea, DailyCandy.com, Art+Culture.com, The Village Voice, New York Daily News, Sun Valley Magazine, Beautiful/Decay, and TrendHunter. Her studio is featured in the Museum of Modern Art \"MoMa PS1: Studio Visit\" project. Perhaps Ms. Hudak's best-known installation, 2006's \"Love\" was featured on the front page of The Bay Ridge Paper and in The Brooklyn Paper. Near-identical works soon appeared elsewhere, such as the December 2007 cover of New York Magazine. The New York Magazine cover image was credited solely to artist Michael De Feo. On September 26, 2014, her exhibit \"See/Thru\" premiered at the DUMBO Arts Festival. Ms. Hudak's husband, artist James Seward, worked as an assistant to Jeff Koons from 2005-2013."

He was born in Street, Somerset, in 1830, and died at Rugby, Warwickshire, in 1907. Before taking up the post at Rugby, Edwards was organist to the Duke of Buccleuch in Dalkeith. He is most widely remembered for his psalm chant in F (Parish Psalter 69, Psalm 25, Ad te, Domine, levavi). But Edwards, who was Editor of the Rugby School Hymn Book, also published music for the organ including a March in G (1881), a one-movement Sonata in E minor (Sonata da Chiesa), which appeared in The Organist's Quarterly Journal Part 62, in 1884., and an Introduction and Fugue in C, first appearing in The Organist's Quarterly Journal, Part 99, in 1893, being re-issued in 1898, under the title Prelude and Fugue, in The Anglican Organist, Vol 15. The Introduction and Fugue in C and the Sonata da Chiesa are recently republished. A photograph of Edwin Edwards appears in Windows on Warwickshire. A Musical Times article (1905) on music at Rugby refers to the \"zealous labours\" of Mr Edwin Edwards, \"former music-master\". After twenty two years at the school, it states, he \"remained still a highly respected resident in the town.\" He is listed elsewhere as having conducted the choir of Rugby School in the years 1867-1886, just short of two decades."

  "text" : "Edith Kellogg Dunton (December 28, 1875 – December 31, 1944) was the author of a popular series of early 20th century juvenile novels called the \"Betty Wales\" series, which she wrote under the pseudonym Margaret Warde. Dunton was born in Rutland, Vermont in 1875 and graduated from Smith College in 1897. The first Betty Wales volume was released in 1904 and published by the Penn Publishing Company. Dunton's identity as the author of the series was not leaked until late 1907, at which time she was also writing under her own name as a critic for The Dial magazine in Chicago. The popularity of the Betty Wales series, which followed the story of the title character from her freshman year at the fictional Harding College through beyond graduation, led to the introduction of a line of \"Betty Wales Dresses\" in 1915, where each purchase entitled the buyer to a free book from the series. Dunton followed up the Wales series (though a last volume was added in 1917) with the \"Nancy Lee\" series. Dunton died in late 1944 and was buried at the Evergreen Cemetery in Rutland."

Eugenio Latilla was born in London, the son of a Neapolitan artist father and an English mother. The sculptor Horatia Augusta Latilla was his sister. He exhibited five paintings (La Biondina in 1829; Richard Godson in 1832; Richard Godson and Mrs. Paget in 1833; H.R.H. The Princess Victoria in 1837) at the Royal Academy. From 1838 to 1851 he frequently exhibited at the Society of British Artists, of which he was a member. Latilla married Harriott Goodwin at St Marylebone Church on 8 November 1831. In 1842 he went to Rome and painted there several works (including a pifferaro; Preparing for a Carnival; Abraham dismissing Hagar and Ishmael). In 1847–1848 Latilla was in Florence; there he painted several works (including Jane Shore's Penance) and exhibited them on his return to London. In 1851 he emigrated to America with his family, consisting of his wife, one son and three daughters. He spent the rest of his life working in New York City and on projects in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Latilla was the architect for a Gothic cottage in Perth Amboy for Caroline Kirkland, a barn (planned by an agriculturist) in Westchester County for Horace Greeley, and home decoration for Cyrus W. Field."

She took up the heptathlon event in 2011 and promptly won the Uzbekistan national title with a personal best of 5287 points. After an absence in the 2012 season she returned to make her senior international debut at the 2013 Asian Athletics Championships. Five personal bests saw her accumulate 5599 points and take the silver medal behind the defending champion, Wassana Winatho of Thailand. Voronina won her second national title in September that year. At the start of the following season, she entered her first major women's pentathlon competition at the 2014 Asian Indoor Athletics Championships. She had a three-way tie on 3951 points with Irina Karpova and Sepideh Tavakoli and was placed fourth on head-to-head results. Yuliya Tarasova, another Uzbekistani athlete, was the silver medallist at the competition. Moving into the outdoor season she set a personal best of 5890 points in Asikkala in August. She was chosen to compete at the 2014 Asian Games and established herself among the region's best athletes by taking the gold medal in a score of 5912 points. Setting bests in the 100 metres hurdles, high jump, 200 metres, and the 800 metres final, she beat both defending champion Tarasova and the Asian indoor champion Wang Qingling of China."

During his second year of studies, his personal short film “Ma Yenaad Aaleik” (\"Happy Birthday\"in English) was selected for the Beirut International Film Festival 2011. “Starring Julia” (\"Men Boutoulet Julia\" in Arabic) is his bachelor's degree short film which tells the story of Julia, a 70-year-old lady who decides to pursue her lifetime dream of being an actress. “Starring Julia” has been shown at film festivals around the world including the Baghdad Film Festival, MENAR Film Festival  The 5th edition of FICMEC Outbox Film Festival(Page 3)  NDU Student Film Festival (Page 19) \"Starring Julia\" won the Orbit Prize at the Beirut International Film Festival 2012 and “Best Student Short Film” award in Monaco at the MCFF 2013. In 2013, Fahed participated in Jamming With The Light, a cinematography workshop for directors and cinematographers conducted by Muriel AboulRouss, which resulted in a 28-minute short film entitled Impulse inspired by Dialogues by Jacques Salome. Fahed's contribution to Impulse was entitled Habibi, a black and white film describing the struggle of a married woman who can't decide whether to stay or leave her husband. In 2015, Elie Fahed released on YouTube a two-minute film called \"Things I Love\". In a recent interview with StepFeed, Elie explains the inspiration behind his latest project that it was rather simple: “I was driving and the yellow light turned red, it felt so good crossing at the very last second, so I decided to put this moment somewhere, the next morning I had a Man'ouche and I was like, ‘this very simple culinary invention can make your day better, and throughout the days I discovered that there’re so many cool and fun moments that we should share with the world, and I decided to film this.” At less than 3 minutes, the film quickly highlights all of the small things that make Fahed happy and appreciate life. From London’s foggy weather, to Instagram to Fahed’s favorite directors, the brief vignette into Fahed’s favorite things makes the viewer remember to appreciate the mundane moments and simple joys of life.

  "text" : "Emilio Savonanzi, nicknamed il Reniano (1580-1666) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period, active mainly in and around his native Bologna. He trained under Guido Reni, hence his nickname. He painted a Scene from the Life of Santa Lucia for the church of San Martino in Anatoglia. He painted frescoes about the Life of the Virgin in the church of Santa Maria della Grazia in Camerino, Italy. He painted a Deposition now in the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo. Luigi Lanzi describes him as an erudite, eclectic, wealthy and peripatetic, but not assembling his knowledge into excellence:Savonanzi, a Bolognese noble, attached himself to the art when nearly arrived at manhood, but he attended Cremonini more than Calvart; and strongly addicted to changing masters, entered the school of Lodovico Caracci, next that of Guido at Bologna, of Guercino at Cento, and finally the studio of Algardi, a sculptor at Rome. By such means he became a good theorist and an able lecturer, applauded in every particular of his art; nor was he wanting in good practice, uniting many styles in one, in which however that of Guido most prevails. Still he was not equally correct in all his pieces, even betraying feebleness of touch, and not scrupling to denominate himself an artist of many hands. He resided at Ancona, next at Camerino, at which places, as well as in the adjacent districts, he left a variety of works."

  "text" : "Ellen Carter (1762 – 22 September 1815) was an English artist and book illustrator. Carter was the daughter of Walter Vavasour of Weston in Yorkshire, and Ellen, his wife, daughter of Edward Elmsall of Thornhill in the same county. She was born in 1762, and baptised at St Olave's Church, York, on 16 May. At an early age, though a Protestant, she was placed in a convent at Rouen, with which her family had been connected for some generations. Though strongly affected by the surrounding influence of the Roman Catholic religion, she never actually forsook her own religion, and after her return to England she became well known for her devotion to her church. In November 1787, she married the curate of Thornhill, the Rev. John Carter. Her husband became the head-master of Lincoln Grammar School, and incumbent of St. Swithin's church. Mrs. Carter was devoted to artistic pursuits, and particularly excelled in drawing the human figure. She drew illustrations for the Archæologia, The Gentleman's Magazine, and other similar works. A print was published from a design by her, entitled ‘The Gardener's Girl,’ intended as a companion to Thomas Barker's ‘Woodboy.’ Her drawings were frequently in private collections. Her devotion to her art told on a constitution that was never strong, and the untimely death of her eldest son in the Peninsula gave her a shock from which she never recovered. She died on 22 September 1815 and was buried in the churchyard of St. Peter in Eastgate, Lincoln."

He would be one of the plethora of talented cameramen to work on the Howard Hughes' 1930 aerial classic, Hell's Angels, along with such other notable cameramen and future directors of photography, Paul Ivano, Henry Cronjager and Ernest Laszlo. But it was as special effects artist that he would have his greatest success, working on such classic films as Otto Preminger's Laura; George Cukor's Winged Victory; The Keys of the Kingdom, starring Gregory Peck; Elia Kazan's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn; Anna and the King of Siam, starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison; and 1948's Deep Waters, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award (losing to the special effects team of Portrait of Jennie). Snyder died in 1982."

In 1946 Heymann began studies in Philosophy and Literature at the University of Bucharest, then to the University of Vienna and in 1947 to the University of Heidelberg where he completed his doctoral degree under Hans-Georg Gadamer. In 1953 he emigrated to Uruguay teaching at the \"Instituto de Profesores Artigas\" and at the University of the Republic until Juan María Bordaberry came into power. He was forced to leave the country after confronting local authorities regarding autonomy for the University. He then moved to Venezuela in 1974, teaching first at the Universidad Simon Bolivar and at the Central University of Venezuela until his retirement in 2006, although he kept his position as active professor for the rest of his life. His research focused on Kant and in classical German philosophy. His testimony as a Holocaust survivor was compiled in the book \"Exilio a La Vida: Sobrevivientes Judíos De La Shoá\"."

  "text" : "Edward Cronjager (March 21, 1904 – June 15, 1960) was an American cinematographer, whose career spanned from the silent era through the 1950s. He came from a family of cinematographers, with his father, uncle, and brother all working in the film industry behind the camera. His work covered over 100 films, and included projects on the small screen towards the end of his career. He filmed in both black and white and color mediums, and his work received nominations for seven Academy Awards over the span of three decades, although he never won the statue. He was the preferred director of photography of early film star Richard Dix, and served on several Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) committees, as well as being selected by the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC) to test new types of film stock. Cronjager pioneered several new techniques and types of cinematography, developing new camera angles in the 1920s, working on one of the earliest film noirs in the 1940s, and using Cinemascope in underwater photography in the 1950s."
