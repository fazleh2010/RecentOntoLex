  "text" : "Floyd John Lewis (1916–1993) was an American surgeon who performed the first successful open heart operation, closing an atrial spetal defect in a 5-year-old girl, on September 2, 1952. For the next 3 years, Lewis and colleagues operated on 60 patients with atrial septal defects using hypothermia and inflow occlusion. He was best friends with C. Walton Lillehei and they worked together at the University of Minnesota. In 1956, Lewis moved on from Minnesota to Northwestern University where he became the first full-time member of the faculty of surgery. At Northwestern, F. John continued investigating the use of hypothermia in the operating room. Lewis later trained Thomas Starzl, who was completing a fellowship in cardiovascular surgery at Northwestern, and helped him to win a Markle Scholarship. After being passed up for the Chair of Surgery position, Lewis departed for Santa Barbara in 1976 where he engaged in new careers: writing hiking and mountain-climbing essays, and publishing a pamphlet entitled Bicycling Santa Barbara. He died on September 20, 1993 in Santa Barbara of septicemia."

She started work at the age of twelve, then, two years later, took a job for Nestlé in a factory making condensed milk. In 1913, she was a founding member of a branch of the Workers' Union at the factory, and when the sacking of two other founders led to a strike, she took a prominent role. Hancock joined the Independent Labour Party in 1915, and was also very active in the Labour Party, supporting Charles Duncan's campaigns in Clay Cross. She became a full-time district organiser for the Workers' Union in 1917, and continued as an organiser as the Workers' Union became the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU). She also became involved in the campaign for the Trades Union Congress (TUC) to create a women's section. When it did so, she served on the committee, and then from 1935 on the General Council of the TUC. The TUC appointed her as their delegate to the International Labour Organisation, and she served as the Chief Women's Officer of the TUC from 1942. In 1947/8, she served as President of the TUC, and she served on several government committees."

He joined the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (ASC&J) in 1906 and was elected as its Royton branch secretary the following year. Soon, he was also serving as secretary of its Oldham district, and in 1914 he was elected to its national Executive Council. Wolstencroft was elected as Assistant General Secretary of the ASC&J in 1920, and then in 1926 he became General Secretary of its successor, the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers (ASW), elected by a huge majority. This was a period of rapid growth for the union, and Wolstencroft also worked to build international links; during World War II, he was a key founder of the Anglo-Soviet Trade Union Committee. In 1928, he was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), serving until 1949, and in 1942, he was President of the TUC. He also served on executive of the International Union of Woodworkers and its successors, the National Insurance Advisory Committee, and the board of the Disabled Persons Employment Corporation. In 1947, he received the CBE. He retired from the general secretaryship in 1948, becoming President of the Co-operative Press. In his spare time, Wolstencroft enjoyed a variety of sports."

From a young age he had the political guidance of his father, who since the administration of President General José María Cabral y Luna was part of important committees to negotiate a Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Commerce between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. After joining the Faculty of Law at the Instituto Profesional de Santo Domingo (later as Instituto Profesional, en Universidad de Santo Domingo and now as Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo), he abandoned his studies to devote himself to politics and poetry.

  "text" : "Forrest O. Beaty is a retired American track and field athlete memorable for setting the National High School record in the straight 220 yard dash, a race slightly longer than the 200 metres straight. It is the longest standing record on the books, although mostly because that distance is not ran anymore. His record time, set on a Cinder track in 1961 as a high school junior at Herbert Hoover High School in Glendale, California was hand timed at 20.2 and equaled the world record for the imperially measured distance. Later in his high school career, he also set the record for the 100 yard dash at 9.4, just .2 off the world record in that event. He was also spectacular on the football field for the school. He won both races at the CIF California State Meet (coming out of the tunnel at East Los Angeles College) in 1961, repeating in the 100y in 1962. He was named the CIF Southern Section Athlete of the Year in 1962, the same award he shared with future Olympic Champion Ulis Williams in 1961. He was also Track and Field News High School Athlete of the year in 1962. After graduating, Beaty ran for the University of California, Berkeley, and was part of their NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship mile relay team in 1964 and repeated in 1965. His hand-timed, converted 440 yard time, which equalled Grover Klemmer's former world record is still ranked tied for the #3 time on the school's all time list. He also briefly played football as a running back, gaining all of 4 yards in four attempts. He participated in the 1964 Olympic Trials, in the 400 meters, failing to qualify. Rather than pursuing his career in the sport, he focused on his medical education at the University of California, San Francisco. After serving residency with the United States Navy, Beaty established his practice in Forestville, California. He contributed to writing a medical guide \"End-of-life-care: A Practical Guide.\""

As an Anglican theologian, Tennant assimilated much of Huxley’s lectures culminating in the 1901-1902 Hulsean Lecture entitled Origin and Propagation of Sin where he integrated evolutionary ideas into a Christian synthesis. Tennant's primary goal in his writings was an integrative synthesis of the doctrines of the fall and original sin with Huxley’s claims of conflict between Darwinian thought and Christianity."

Reputedly the first castrato to enter into the Papal Chapel, Langa had an instrumental role in the posthumous preservation of Juan Navarro's Psalmi, Hymni ac Magnificat totius Anni. A significant collection of laudi spirituali is extant, of which only a mere handful can be assigned to de Langa with any degree of certainty.

  "text" : "Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel (b. May 1, 1940, Coatepec Harinas, Estado de México) is a Mexican Roman Catholic prelate who served as bishop of Diocese of San Cristóbal de las Casas, in the Archdiocese of Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, from 2000 to 2015. From 1991 to 2000 he was Bishop of Tapachula, Chiapas, where he was succeeded by Rogelio Cabrera López. Ordained as a priest in 1963, he celebrated his 50th anniversary of priesthood in 2013. He became Bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, following the resignation of Bishop Samuel Ruiz, a social progressive who had defended the rights of the indigenous peoples and of the Zapatista rebels. Arizmendi consistently defended Ruiz against his many critics. Arizmendi has a reputation for being theologically conservative but socially progressive. In 2012, he announced that he would be organizing efforts to translate the Catholic Mass and the Bible into the indigenous language Nahuatl. On May 1, 2015, Arizmendi turned 75 and presented his resignation to Pope Francis, but was requested to stay in the position until further notice from the see. Msgr. Enrique Díaz Díaz, who was named as auxiliary bishop of the diocese in May 2014, is expected to succeed Arizmendi as bishop."

He is best known for his fashion photography, published between the mid 1950s and the end of the 1980s, but his photographic opus includes photojournalism, portraiture, landscape, nature and sculpture. In 1988, he produced a major book of interviews with fellow photographers (such as Don McCullin, Robert Doisneau, Sarah Moon, Helmut Newton, Marc Riboud). At the beginning of the 1990s, he was one of the first to experiment with Photoshop. In 1998, he replaced his professional equipment with a compact camera, which he always carries in his pocket, in order to shoot anything, at any moment that seems to him of some interest. In 2011, he put online his first iPad application (Horvatland)."

  "text" : "Frederick Wootton Isaacson (1836-22 February 1898) was an English businessman and Conservative politician. Born in Mildenhall, Suffolk, he was the son of Frederick Isaacson and Emma Elizabeth née Case. In 1857 he married Elizabeth Marie Louise Jaeger, only daughter of Stephen Jaeger, a banker from Frankfurt, Germany. Isaacson initially made a living by the importing of silk. His wife established a millinery business on Regent Street as \"Madame Elise\", which was subsequently converted into a limited company. He later made a living from imports from the West Indies. He was a Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society and of the Royal Society of Literature. He described himself as a \"Progressive Conservative\" in politics and in 1880 put himself forward as a candidate for the constituency of Wednesbury, but withdrew before the poll took place. At the 1885 general election he narrowly failed to win the parliamentary seat of Stepney by 22 votes. In the following year another election was held, and he was elected as Stepney's member of parliament with a majority of 502 over his Liberal Party opponent. At the 1892 general election he held the seat with the narrow majority of 89 votes, but increased this to 470 votes in 1895. He was a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant for the County of London. He was also a magistrate in Monmouthshire, where he was chairman of the Nantyglo and Blaina Iron and Coal Company. He died from influenza and pneumonia at his London residence in Upper Grosvenor Street, aged 61. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery."

He was the member of Saskatoon city council from 1911 to 1912 and served as its mayor from 1913 to 1915. He was born in Belleville, Ontario in 1876 and came to Saskatoon as manager of the Union Bank in 1904. In 1907, Harrison opened a real estate and insurance business. He also served as secretary and treasurer of the Saskatoon Board of Trade. He married Zeta Mabel Charlebois in 1909. Harrison was a member of Saskatoon city council from 1911 to 1912. In 1913 he was elected mayor of the city. He had succeeded James Clinkskill. After the Germans attacked Ypres and sank the luxury ship Lusitania during the first world war Harrison ordered all the Germans and Austrians in Saskatoon to work under guard. He did not seek reelection after his term as mayor ended in 1915. Alexander MacGillivray Young succeeded him as the mayor in 1916. In 1916, he moved to Calgary, Alberta after accepting a position with the federal Department of Labour. His wife was charged with attempted murder in 1922 after shooting Harrison twice in the chest. She was convicted of the lesser charge of discharging a firearm after it was proved that she had removed the lead bullets from the shells; apparently, her intention was to scare her husband. Sometime after Harrison recovered, the couple were divorced. Harrison was named a member of the Order of the British Empire in 1943 for his work in industrial dispute settlement. He died in Vancouver, British Columbia on September 10, 1962 at the age of 85. Harrison Crescent in the Avalon neighbourhood in Saskatoon was named in his honour."

After his flute-playing career ended due to lip paralysis, he opened a haberdashery and Frieda had her first experience merchandising. The business did well at first, but went into bankruptcy following a move. In 1916, Frieda took a buying job in New York and the family moved to Brooklyn. She got the idea to sell samples and surplus apparel at discount prices and in 1920 started the first Loehmann's store in their Brooklyn home. Loehmann purchased odd lots, samples, and overstock from fashion houses on Seventh Avenue. The business eventually earned $3 million per year. Loehmann had three children, Charles, Marjorie, and William."

  "text" : "Frederick Noel Hamilton Wills (Noel) was born in 1887, the youngest son of Sir Frederick Wills of Northmoor, Dulverton and Anne (née Hamilton). Sir Frederick Wills was a director of W D and H O Wills, founded by his forebears, a member of parliament and a staunch Liberal. His wife, Anne, who gave the Founder her maiden surname at baptism, was the daughter of Rev. James Hamilton, a noted Scottish cleric. The influence of both his parents and a close-knit family of two brothers and three sisters was strong as was the family home in Northmoor which inspired a passion for the English countryside. Educated briefly at Winchester and then at Clifton College, it was Magdalen College, Oxford, where Noel Wills studied English, that provided the inspiration to realise an educational vision as the Founder of Rendcomb College. His brother, Gilbert Wills (who became the first Lord Dulverton) and Canon Sewell (the first Chair of Governors) entertained the thought that 'if there had been no Magdalen, there would have been no Rendcomb'. Noel Wills' time at Oxford was marked by wide-ranging reading, a generous appreciation of the talents of those around him and in the words of Professor G S Gordon (who became President of the College) an 'unostentatious goodness'. Noel Wills also developed strong creative interests: painting, music (he was a noteworthy cellist and fine tenor), and design. In the English countryside he loved, Noel Wills rode, hunted, played polo and was a fisherman envied for his skill by peers. He also loved to write: creative and philosophical prose, criticism, verse, even an operetta performed at home in Miserden, as well as some practical advice on fishing and countless letters to friends, all crafted in a beautiful hand. He was always keen to nurture others. In 1909, he started a monthly magazine of poetry with Walter Jerrold. Short-lived though this publication was, as many such ventures of its type and time, contributions were received by Walter de la Mare, Quiller-Couch, Lady Margaret Sackville and Edward Thomas. Further inspiration came in 1912 when Noel Wills married Margery Hamilton Fraser, the eldest daughter of Sir Hugh Fraser of Stromeferry House, Ross-shire. Mrs Wills provided support, abiding encouragement and remained actively involved in his vision for the rest of her life. Noel Wills described himself as 'a dreamer' though his dreams were inspired by philosophical insight, sensitivity to others and a profound concern for the inequalities evident in the society in which he lived. With the advantage of privilege, he felt the need to empower those less fortunate and in doing so showed a foresight borne out by huge changes to the education system in the first half of the century and the genesis of grammar school education. In his words, 'When opportunity comes to the favoured few alone, how small an advance can be anticipated'. Of course, the Wills family was no stranger when it came to educational altruism; the Founder's Uncle and three of his cousins had founded and endowed buildings at Bristol University. It was perhaps destined that Noel Wills would also make his mark on the world of education. In 1918, the Founder bought Rendcomb Park with a view to forming a 'Transition School' to provide a free boarding education to about forty boys from the elementary schools of Gloucestershire and prepare them for entry to Public School. He envisaged that by giving them 'the best possible education, some would gain entry by scholarship to Public Schools and perhaps, a few ultimately to University. This initial vision was broad and generous, involving supplements from the endowment to subsidise scholarships and leaving scholarships for those who could not secure entry to Public Schools for 'assistance in beginning professions and trades'. This vision evolved in the next two years in part by the Christmas gift that Mrs Wills had given her husband in 1917: An Adventure in Education by J H Simpson. Simpson had been educated at Rugby School and Pembroke College, Cambridge where he studied Classics and History before teaching at Clifton, Charterhouse, Gresham's and Rugby. The Founder invited Simpson ('one of the men I most earnestly desire to consult') to Miserden in February 1919 and the conversation they had shaped the future of the vision. Instead of providing what was essentially a Preparatory School education, Rendcomb College would educate boys for five years to sixteen, or seven were the boys of University material. That Noel Wills was prepared to compromise his original intentions says much for his receptiveness to new ideas and the respect that he had for the educationalist; that Simpson was prepared to leave Rugby to take the founding Headship of Rendcomb rather than posts at Oundle or Leeds University says much for the respect that the educationalist had for the Founder. Simpson's attraction to Rendcomb would have been increased as he learnt more of the Founder's intentions in a series of letters between the two in the months after their meeting (the Founder being the excellent fisherman that he was!) outlining his intention to provide 'a social, moral and intellectual education rather than mere scholarship'. Simpson clearly saw the potential that such a brief provided.On 2 June 1920, Rendcomb College opened with twelve boys, Simpson at the helm and Noel Wills as Chair of Governors. The two men shaped the path of the School for a little over seven years and their relationship was founded on mutual respect and affection. In 1924, the Founder wrote an illuminating piece for The English Review which gives a fascinating insight into those early years and his progressive educational vision. ‘Remembering what he wanted us to be – his pride in what has been done well, his indulgence for what has been done less well – we must go forward, humbly, but confidently, in the work of making his vision a reality.’James Herbert Simpson, founding Headmaster of Rendcomb College Noel Wills died in the autumn of 1927"

  "text" : "Francisco de Cubas y González-Montes (April 13, 1826 – January 2, 1899) was a Spanish architect and politician. He was also known as the Marquis of Cubas (Marqués de Cubas) after his noble title, the marquisate of Cubas. He was also from 1894 the Marquis of Fontalba. He studied at the Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura in Madrid and obtained scholarships that allowed him to complete his studies in Italy and Greece. Upon his return to Spain in 1858, he won a medal at the National Exposition of 1858. A member of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando from 1870, he worked as an architect while also pursuing a political career as a member of the Cortes Generales (as a deputy or diputado), en 1893, as the senator representing Ávila between 1896–98, and, he served as mayor of Madrid for a month (November 6, 1892 – December 1, 1892). His work represents some of the most well-known of 19th century architecture of Madrid, and his style is noted for its use of brick and his works in the Neo-Gothic and Historicist styles. His work includes the Jesuit college known as the Colegio Nuestra Señora del Recuerdo, the University of Deusto in Bilbao, and the National Museum of Anthropology in Madrid. It also includes the Palace of Arenzana (today the French embassy) in Madrid and the Church of Santa Cruz in Madrid. His most famous work is Almudena Cathedral, begun in 1883. The original plan had been to create a parochial church. Francisco de Cubas revised this plan, deciding instead to create an imposing Neo-Gothic cathedral, the style popular at that time, especially due to the influence of Viollet-le-Duc. This project was later modified significantly: work on the cathedral encountered delays due to economic difficulties, and later the style was modified to a Neoclassic style, in line with the nearby Palacio de Oriente (Palacio Real). More representative of Francisco de Cubas’ vision is the Castle of Butrón in Gatica, in the Basque Country. He married the noblewoman Matilde de Erice y Urquijo in 1860. They are both buried in a chapel of the crypt of the Cathedral of Almudena."

In 1952, Turnham signed with Jake Porter's Combo Records in Los Angeles, where he recorded the first of six singles for the label. Three of the singles featured vocals by Cledus Harrison, notably the single \"No Parking After Eight\" while two singles were recorded with vocals by Raymond Odoms- 'Heavy Dreams' and 'Alibi Baby'. Turnham also recorded the Louis Jordon-esque instrumental \"Turnham's Greens\" and a final instrumental, \"Rocket Ride.\" Turnham also recorded for both the Aladdin and Aries labels before moving to Fort Worth, Texas.

  "text" : "Francesco Miano-Petta (born April 12, 1979 in Naples) is a retired amateur Italian freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's super heavyweight category. He won two bronze medals in the 120-kg division at the Mediterranean Games (2005 and 2009), and finished tenth at the 2004 Summer Olympics, representing his nation Italy. Having worked as a police officer for Polizia di Stato, Miano-Petta trained full-time for the wrestling squad at VVF Padula in Naples, under head coach Luigi Marigliano. Miano-Petta qualified for the Italian squad in the men's 120 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, Miano-Petta finished third from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria to guarantee his spot on the Italian wrestling team. He lost two opening matches each to U.S. wrestler Kerry McCoy (0–7) and Kazakhstan's Marid Mutalimov (0–3) by an identical margin, but sailed smoothly with an easy victory over Kyrgyzstan's Yury Mildzihov, who forfeited to appear in their match due to injury. Finishing third in the prelim pool and tenth overall, Miano-Petta's performance was not enough to advance him to the quarterfinals. Miano-Petta also sought his bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, but failed to earn a spot on a miniature Italian wrestling team from the Olympic Qualification Tournament. In 2009, he capped off his sporting career with a second career bronze medal in the 120-kg class at the Mediterranean Games in Pescara."

  "text" : "Frank Okada (1931 - 2000) was an American Abstract Expressionist painter, mainly active in the Pacific Northwest. His mature style often featured brightly colored, off-kilter geometric shapes done in large format, including round canvasses; subtly elaborate brushwork suggested the influence of both traditional Asian art and the \"mystics\" of the Northwest School. His later work at times used symbolic shapes which more directly evoked his Nisei heritage and the years he spent in detention camps with his family during World War II. He taught art at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon from 1969 to 1999."

He has revolutionised urdu poetry by his classical aptitude towards URDU Ghazal.\"Udasi\" is the main influence on his poetry but this element of \"UDASI\" is not pessimistic it is in the positive way.He has written many books more than 68 which is one of the remarkable contribution towards Urdu literature. Farhat Abbas shah started his poetry in early age when he was in school and became very famous poet. Farhat Abbas Shah has variation in his personality.His every layer is not only one step ahead to self development but he paved the way for others as well.He truckled down the conventional attitude of poetry and introduced his new style to urdu ghazal. He has been criticised by many contemporaries but he did not give up his struggle and finally got recognised in all over the world. Farhat Abbas Shah is working for different TV channels and radio now a days. He is founder of FARZ Foundation which is working for poor people in Pakistan on the bases of Micro finance. Farhat Abbas Shah has been criticised for his poetry by his contemporaries.But the most important factor is that what ever critics say about his poetry, his each word of poetry is heart touching.The \"Derd\" and \"Gudaz\" with which is whole poetry is injected captivate the mind of reader and take to the not only romantic world created by Farhat Abbas Shah but to the new angels of saying somthing.This happens only with Farhat's poetry not with conteporaries."

Haller was brought in to carry on Magyarization in Croatia. In 1843, the use of the Illyrian name was banned. In large part due to the July victims incident, in which thirteen protesters were killed in Zagreb, Haller resigned his post and continued his military career in the Austrian Empire. Bishop Juraj Haulik became ban soon after. In 1845 Haller donated 500 forint for building the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb."

During his lifetime, he amassed an impressive collection of Islamic art. Being inspired by Carl Humann, in 1895/96, he conducted archaeological research in Phyrgia, Lycaonia, and Pisidia. From within these regions of Asia Minor, he investigated architectural monuments and collected epigraphic material. In 1905, with Ernst Herzfeld, he performed excavatory work at Samarra, the 9th-century capital of the Abbasid dynasty. The two men published their findings in \"Archäologische Reise im Euphrat-und Tigris Gebeit\" (Archaeological journey in the Euphrates and Tigris region). He collected objects of art from throughout the Middle East, especially from Persia and Constantinople. These items were put on exhibition in Berlin (1899), and later Paris at the Exposition des arts musulmans (1903). He donated most of his collection to the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin, where from 1921 to 1931 he was the director of its \"Islamic department\"."

  "text" : "Frederick William Kingston (24 December 1855 – 30 January 1933) was an English clergyman, schoolmaster and cricketer who played a few first-class cricket matches for Cambridge University and amateur sides in 1878 and 1886. He was born in Oundle, Northamptonshire and died at Willington, Bedfordshire. Fred Kingston was the eldest of seven brothers who played first-class cricket or other cricket just below first-class level – several of them, including Fred, played for Northamptonshire in years before and, in Hubert's case, just after the side's accession to first-class status in 1905. A right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper, Fred Kingston's first match while he was a student at Pembroke College, Cambridge came for an England XI against the university side, and a few weeks later he played for a team calling itself \"The Gentlemen of England\" in a 12-a-side first-class match against Oxford University at Oxford in which he scored 61 in the middle order. He then appeared in three matches for the Cambridge University side, the final one of which was the 1878 University Match against Oxford, though he did not keep wicket in this game and batted low in the Cambridge line-up. That was the end of his first-class cricket apart from a single appearance for a \"Cambridge Past and Present\" side which played the Australians in 1886, when he batted at No 10 and kept wicket. He continued, however, to play lower grade cricket, mainly for Northamptonshire but also for Devon. In 1882, he captained the Northamptonshire side in their non-first-class match against the Australians."

  "text" : "Fred Jessey (born September 3, 1977 in Yenagoa, Bayelsa) is a retired amateur Nigerian freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's welterweight category. He represented his nation Nigeria at the 2004 Summer Olympics and produced a remarkable tally of four career medals, including a bronze in the 66-kg division at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England and a welterweight title at the 2003 All-Africa Games in Abuja. Jessey also trained for his native Bayelsa State's wrestling club under his personal coach Jackson Bidei. Jessey made sporting headlines at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, where he grappled his way over New Zealand's Ricardo Aryan to clinch the bronze in the 66-kg division. Following his immediate sporting success, Jessey went on to celebrate a boastful victory for the Nigerians, as he beat Algeria's Farid Hanoun for the gold in the same class at the 2003 All-Africa Games in Abuja. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Jessey qualified for the Nigerian squad, as a lone wrestler, in the men's welterweight class (66 kg). Earlier in the process, he placed sixth at the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria, but managed to fill up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling through a tripartite invitation. Jessey lost his opening match 1–3 to South Korea's Baek Jin-kuk, and then lost to Japan's Kazuhiko Ikematsu on a pin with a minute remaining; he was ranked penultimate out of 22 wrestlers in the final standings."

  "text" : "Frederick Lee (11 August 1840 – 13 November 1922) was an English barrister and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, Surrey and Middlesex, plus other amateur sides, in the 1860s. He was born in Finsbury, London and died at Streatham, also in London. Lee was educated at Rugby School and at St John's College, Cambridge. He was the fifth son of Henry Lee, a builder from Balham, and among his siblings was a half-brother, John, 15 years older than Frederick, who played cricket for Cambridge University, Surrey and a lot of other amateur sides in the 1840s. Frederick Lee was a right-handed middle order batsman and a bowler whose bowling style is not known. He played in a couple of first-class cricket matches for Cambridge University in 1860 and was then selected for the University Match against Oxford University at Lord's where, with scores of 16 and 6, he did as well as any batsman in a very low scoring game which Cambridge won narrowly. He played again for Cambridge in 1861 and 1862 but not successfully enough to retain his place in the side for the University Match in either season. Across the 1860s, he played for a variety of teams: Surrey in 1861; the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players matches at The Oval in 1861 and 1862; Middlesex both before and after the formation of the county club; Gentlemen of the South; and Southgate. He was a fairly consistent scorer, but his highest was only 35, which he reached twice in his career; his bowling was occasional and he never took more than two wickets in an innings. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack states, under the initials of the editor Sydney Pardon: \"Never losing his keen interest in cricket, Mr Lee was a member of the Surrey Committee till nearly the end of his long life, resigning in 1922. He served on the M. C. C. Committee from 1878 to 1882 and again from 1883 to 1887.\" Outside cricket, Lee qualified as a lawyer and was called to the bar in 1865, practising on the South Eastern Circuit."

The son of a certain Bahram, Farrukhmard completed the book in ca. 620, during the reign of the Sasanian king Khosrau II (r. 590-628). The book used some of its information from the archives of his native city, Gur, and also some privately owned archives. Nothing more is known about Farrukhmard; he probably died in the 7th-century."

He then went on to work as an illustrator for the Navy while serving on the USS Yorktown. Francis Woodahl was the founder of the Western Artists of America and was also recognized for his mastering of oil, tempera and acrylic painting in Native American Western art styles and the realism of his color palette blending methods which make him one of the top Western realism artists of his time. He has had many galleries that have and are currently showing his work in Arizona, California, Texas and throughout the United States."

Since his burial – and until the present day – the islanders have steadfastly maintained the grave. This led to admiration among the late 19th century British community in Japan including prominent members such as the British Ambassador Sir Ernest Satow, and a number of newspaper articles appeared around the world in 1899 recounting the story and praising the conscientiousness of the local people. Since then the grave’s story has continued to feature in the world's media, and continues to be celebrated in Japan as a demonstration of the historic relationship between the two countries.Lake's story also involves Richard Henry Brunton and Thomas B Glover as well as the aforementioned Ernest Satow, all of whom had important roles in Japan's modernisation during the Meiji era."

  "text" : "Fadhila Louati (Arabic: فضيلة لواتي‎‎; born March 3, 1979 in Tunis) is a retired amateur Tunisian freestyle wrestler, who competed in the women's flyweight category. Considered one of the nation's top wrestlers in her decade, Louati has yielded a marvelous record of three gold medals in her career hardware at the All-Africa Games (1999 and 2003), and at the 2001 Mediterranean Games in Tunis. She also had an opportunity to represent her nation Tunisia in the 48-kg division at the 2004 Summer Olympics, finishing fourteenth in the process. Louati is also a member of the wrestling squad for Centre Intégré de Radès in her native Tunis, under her personal coach Noureddine Mefri. When Tunisia hosted the 2001 Mediterranean Games in Tunis, Louati emerged herself into a sporting fame, as she beat Greece's Agora Papavasiliou for the gold medal in the 46-kg division. Following her immediate sporting success, Louati went on to produce another boastful victory for the Tunisians for the women's flyweight title at the 2003 All-Africa Games in Abuja, Nigeria. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Louati qualified for her Tunisian squad, as a lone wrestler, in the inaugural 48 kg class. Earlier in the process, she placed fourth from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Madrid, Spain, but managed to fill up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling through a tripartite invitation. Louati lost two matches each to Greece's Fani Psatha and Tajikistan's Lidiya Karamchakova on technical fall, and was immediately halted by eventual Olympic champion Irini Merleni of Ukraine before reaching the two-minute mark due to a 10-point superiority rule, leaving her on the bottom of the prelim pool and placing last out of fourteen wrestlers in the final standings."

Earlier in the process, she placed fourth from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, but managed to fill up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling and the Hellenic Olympic Committee, as Greece received an automatic berth for being the host nation. Psatha began the preliminary competition early by pinning Tunisia's Fadhila Louati with only forty seconds left in front of the boisterous home crowd inside Ano Liossia Olympic Hall. She lost her succeeding match 3–5 in overtime to Tajikistan's Lidiya Karamchakova, and was immediately halted by Ukraine's Irini Merleni at the one-minute mark due to a 10–point superiority rule. Psatha placed third in the preliminary competition and tenth overall; he did not advance to the quarterfinals. At the 2005 Mediterranean Games in Almería, Spain, Psatha overcame her Olympic setback to edge France's Anne Deluntsch off the mat for the gold medal in the same class."

Unusually amongst yacht designers of the time, his principal focus was cruising yachts rather than racing yachts. His focus on cruising rather than racing meant that he became known for yachts which had attractive lines and better space down below than their racing equivalents."

He was active between 1923 and 1940. He received training in Chicago, Illinois, in chiropractic, and is referred to in publications as \"Dr. Frank McCoy.\" He did not have an M.D. degree. His book, The Fast Way To Health, was first published in 1923 by the Times-Mirror Press. His first newspaper column \"Health and Diet Advice\" ran in the Los Angeles Times from 1927 to 1932 and was syndicated in other cities. During roughly this time, he also lectured and had a radio program in the Los Angeles area. Other newspaper columns he has authored include \"How to Keep Well\" and \"Here's To Your Health.\" His opinions drew criticism in The American Journal of Public Health and in a 1934 JAMA editorial which states: How long will newspapers and periodicals which share some responsibility for the public health continue to advise the uninformed in regard to infectious diseases in such ways as to encourage the spread and the virulence of these infections? It is not known how many newspapers print these daily discourses of Frank McCoy, pet of the Los Angeles Times. Surely editors fail their readers when they continue to promulgate such superlative nonsense as emanates from McCoy and his Los Angeles Times associates. He died on March 31, 1940, at the age of 52 in his home at the Uplifters Club in Southern California. His death was related to liver disease."

He likened pastry-making to piano- playing: \"It is an art that comes as much from the heart as the hands,\" he said. As an accomplished hotelier, with his partner Brian Sack he set the bar for a new style of country house hotel."

Not much is known about Francesco de' Franceschi's except through his works. He primarily painted religious-themed works for church commissions. His style shows influence from Michele Giambono, and it is possible that he collaborated with Antonio Vivarini in Venice. An altarpiece which was most likely from a church in Padua or Venice and now is in the Museo Civico, Padua (1447) has been attributed to him. Two panels St. Mary Magdalen and St Catherine of Alexandria are located in the Ashmolean Museum."

There is documentation of a trip to Venice, where he is thought to have gone to study his main stylistic references: Antonello da Messina, Giovanni Bellini and Alvise Vivarini. His most notable work is the polyptych kept at the basilica of Cortemaggiore, although it is currently missing a couple of paintings. He was the father of the painter Girolamo Francesco Maria Mazzola. He died at the age of about 45 years, during an epidemic of plague."

  "text" : "Francisco de Osona, also Francisco de Osona the Younger, (c.1465–c.1514) was a Spanish Renaissance painter. Francisco was born in Valencia. There has been some confusion between Francisco and his father Rodrigo de Osona. Father and son worked closely together in their workshop in Valencia, therefore works are often attributed to both, although some assumptions are made that Francisco was more open to what was newer styles and forms in Italy. However, while the activity of Rodrigo ended with his death in 1518, Francisco died before him much younger in 1514. The second table of the Epiphany, preserved in London, is signed by \"The teacher's son Rodrigo\", in which, on the contrary, there seems to have more traditional trend seen in the works of the father. Francisco has been credited with Christ before Pilate in the Museu de Belles Arts de València, as well as The Adoration of the Magi in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The work of two Osona artists, along with Paolo de San Leocadio, form the basis for Spanish classicism in painting."

  "text" : "Fabrice Aragno (born March 31, 1970) is a Swiss director, producer, and cinematographer. He attended the École cantonale d'art de Lausanne, graduating in 1998. Aragno has made several short films, including Dimanche (his graduation film, selected for the 1999 Cannes Film Festival), Le Jeu (2003), and Autoure de Claire (2010). Since 2002, he has worked with Jean-Luc Godard, directing Notre musique (2004) and on picture and sound for Film Socialisme (2010), Les Trois Désastres (2013) and Goodbye to Language (French: Adieu au langage) (2014). To create certain effects in the 3D film, Aragno built his own camera rig in order to allow the 3D image to appear as a double exposure in each of the spectators eyes. This effect has been called innovative and a new addition to cinematic techniques. Aragno said that he \"made a couple of tests with friends at their home of a boy and a girl…I asked the boy to go to the kitchen on my right, and the right camera followed him and the left stayed, so the 3-D broke. The girl is in your left eyes and the boy on the right. When he was in the kitchen, your brain didn’t know how to watch. It hurts to watch a little, but it was interesting, and when the boy comes back to the girl, the two cameras were again in classic 3-D.\" In 2012, Radio Télévision Suisse (RTS) employed him as director on a documentary film about Godard, one of a 10-part series on Swiss directors. The film, Quod Erat Demonstrandum, is a 26-minute montage of clips from Godard's films. Working with the Swiss Film Archive, he edited and co-produced the films Amore carne and Sangue, directed by Pippo Delbono, and directed Freddy Buache, le cinéma. He also produced L'invisible (2013) for the Lemancolia exhibition held at the Musée Jenisch de Vevey, and Pris dans le tourbillon (2014) for general release."

From 1915 to 1925, McKenzie was President of Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. McKenzie's tenure, before and after World War I, was during a turbulent period in American history. In spite of many challenges, McKenzie developed Fisk as the premier all Black university in the United States, secured Fisk’s academic recognition as a standard college by the Carnegie Foundation, Columbia University and the University of Chicago, raised a $1 million endowment fund to ensure quality faculty and laid a foundation for Fisk’s accreditation and future success.

  "text" : "Fernando Rocha Brant (October 9, 1946 – June 12, 2015) was a Brazilian poet, lyricist and journalist, born in Caldas, Minas Gerais. Brant's interest in music and literature began to increase while he studied law at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. At the beginning of the 1960s, Brant made friends with Milton Nascimento who soon became his creative partner and encouraged him to write his first lyrics, \"Travessia\". The song won the second place in the II Festival International da Canção (International Song Festival) in Rio de Janeiro in 1967. In the same year, \"Travessia\" was included in Nascimento's first album and became one of the better known songs in his repertoire. In 1969 Brant got a job as a journalist in O Cruzeiro magazine affiliate in Belo Horizonte. That same year, in Belo Horizonte, Brant and friends began articulating a project that would become Clube da Esquina, an influential Brazilian music artists collective. His partnership with Milton Nascimento resulted in over 200 songs recorded by the most respected artists in Brazil. Among Milton-Brant most famous compositions are \"Travessia\", \"Maria Maria\", \"Canção da América\", \"Encontros e Despedidas\" and \"Nos Bailes da Vida\". Brant composed more than 300 songs with multiple partners. He also wrote scripts and lyrics for ballets and plays, and soundtracks for Brazilian films and telenovelas. On June 12, 2015, Fernando Brant died in Belo Horizonte from complications of a second liver transplantation surgery."

He was born at Beeston, Nottinghamshire and died at Taverham Hall, Norwich, Norfolk. Micklethwait was educated at Eton College and Jesus College, Cambridge. He played cricket at Eton as a middle-order batsman and in 1836 he appeared in two matches for Cambridge University that have subsequently been considered as first-class; the second of them was the 1836 University Match against Oxford University, in which he scored 6 and 0. Between 1839 and 1848 he played in four further first-class matches for the MCC; in the last of these, a game against Cambridge University that was finished in a single day, he scored 20 out of an MCC total of 54, and this was his highest first-class score. In minor matches he appeared frequently through to the 1860s for I Zingari, the nomadic amateur side. He retained links to cricket, being on the committee of the MCC. Micklethwait's younger brother, Sotherton, also played first-class cricket for Cambridge University. Micklethwait graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1839 and was called to the bar in 1842. He specialised in property law and was an \"equity draftsman and conveyancer\". He left \"under £70,000\" when he died in 1878."

  "text" : "Florence Nagle (26 October 1894 – 30 October 1988) was a trainer and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of pedigree dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, and went on to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters. Described as \"the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing\", Nagle trained her first racehorse in 1920, the Irish-bred colt Fernley. At that time women were forced to employ men to hold a Jockey Club trainers licence on their behalf, or to have licences in their husbands' names. Nagle worked peacefully to redress such injustices to her sex. She successfully challenged the well-established leading gentlemen's clubs of the racing and canine worlds over their gender inequality, and in 1966 became one of the first two women in the United Kingdom licensed to train racehorses. The first racehorse officially trained in Nagle's name was Mahwa, registered as being owned by her friend Miss Newton Deakin, with whom she jointly owned some of her dogs. Dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for women jockeys, Nagle sponsored the Florence Nagle Girl Apprentices' Handicap first run in 1986 at Kempton Park. She died at her home in West Chiltington, Sussex, two years later at the age of 94, leaving funds in her will for the continuation of the race."

  "text" : "Franziska Baumann (born April 9, 1965) is a Swiss musician and composer, specializing in improvisation and composed music (vocals, flute, live electronics). Baumann studied at the Winterthur Conservatory, majoring in flute with a minor in singing. Following her conservatory studies, she completed improvisation classes with Fred Frith, Barre Phillips, and George Lewis. She also studied with vocal artists such as Phil Campanella, Lauren Newton, and Joan La Barbara. As a vocalist she makes use of extended and microtonal, with clicking and percussive sounds, tone changes and language-related techniques. Baumann performs solo and with musicians including Pierre Favre, Joëlle Léandre, Lê Quan Ninh, Jacques Demierre, Peter Schaerli, and Matthias Ziegler. She is also part of the improvisation trio, Potage du Jour, alongside Jürg Solothurnmann and Christoph Baumann. Her repertoire as a composer ranges from improvised works and electro-acoustic compositions to sound installations and large scale surround sound projects. As Artist in Residence at the Amsterdam Centre For Electro Instrumental Music (STEIM) Baumann programmed a data glove so that she could trigger voice and sound articulations in real time via gesture. Since 2006 Baumann has served as a lecturer in vocal performance and improvisation at the Hochschule der Künste in Bern, where she is also involved in research projects on topics such as sound without body and Gesture performance. Franziska Baumann lives and works in Bern, Switzerland."

He opened the innings for Cambridge University in a single match against Marylebone Cricket Club in July 1835, failed to score in either innings and is not recorded as bowling; nor, indeed, is there any record of him playing in any further matches, even minor games. Nicholl graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1836 and became a solicitor in London, practising from an address near the Royal Courts of Justice in The Strand."

During those years he would often be billed as Pinky. In his final screen performance, on the small screen's The Donna Reed Show in 1961, he would return to his roots and be credited as Franklin Pinky Parker. His film career would include appearances in such classic films as They Were Expendable, It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, Mighty Joe Young, and Pat and Mike. Occasionally he would have a larger role, such as the lead in the 1935 film, Sweet Surrender. He would die of a heart attack in Hollywood, California on June 12, 1962."
