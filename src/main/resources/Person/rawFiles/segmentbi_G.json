  "text" : "Gregory White Smith (October 4, 1951 – April 10, 2014) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning American biographer of both Jackson Pollock and Vincent van Gogh. In addition to writing 18 books with Steven Naifeh, Smith was an accomplished musician, historic preservationist, art collector, philanthropist, attorney, and businessman who founded several companies including Best Lawyers® that spawned an entire industry of professional rankings. His brain tumor, which was diagnosed in 1975 led to 13 brain surgeries as well as radiation and nuclear medicine treatments and experimental chemotherapeutic regimens. His search for cutting edge medical care was profiled on CBS’s “60 Minutes” and recounted in his book Making Miracles Happen. Jackson Pollock: An American Saga was published in 1990, winning the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. The Philadelphia Enquirer called the book “Brilliant and definitive … so absorbing in its narrative drive and so exhaustively detailed that it makes everything that came before seem like trial balloons.\" Van Gogh: The Life, which Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times called “magisterial,” was published in 2011 with a companion website hosting over 6,000 pages of notes. The book stirred global controversy by debunking the widely accepted theory that Van Gogh committed suicide and arguing instead that village bullies shot him. “As a tale of ambition, hard-fought fleeting triumphs and dark despair,” said the San Francisco Gate, “it has the dramatic pull of a gripping nineteenth-century novel. … [The] biography enriches the eye. Its insight and vast information vault readers into the work of Van Gogh and the artists of his time. It deepens the experience of looking at art.\" “A tour de force,” said the Los Angeles Times, a “sweepingly authoritative, astonishingly textured book.\" He died of a rare brain tumor, which he battled for four decades, in 2014 at the age of 62."

  "text" : "Gordon Douglas Slade (born December 11, 1955 in Toronto) is a Canadian mathematician, specializing in probability theory. Slade received in 1977 his bachelor's degree from the University of Toronto and in 1984 his PhD under Joel Feldman and Lon Rosen at the University of British Columbia. As a postdoc he was a lecturer at the University of Virginia. From 1986 he was at McMaster University and since 1999 he is a professor at the University of British Columbia. He developed the technique of lace expansion (originally introduced by David Brydges and Thomas C. Spencer in 1985) with applications to probability theory and statistical mechanics, such as self-avoiding random walks and their enumeration, random graphs, percolation theory, and branched polymers. In 1989 Slade proved with Takashi Hara that the Aizenman–Newman triangle condition at critical percolation is valid in sufficiently high dimension. The Hara–Slade result has important consequences in mean field theory. In 1991 Slade and Hara used the lace expansion to prove that the average distance covered in self-avoiding random walks in 5 or more dimension grows as the square root of the number of steps in a simple random walk and that the scaling limit is Brownian motion. Slade received in 1995 the Coxeter–James Prize and in the 2010 the CRM-Fields-PIMS Prize. He became a Fellow in 2000 of the Royal Society of Canada, in 2010 of the Fields Institute, and in 2012 of the American Mathematical Society and of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. In 2003 he was awarded with Remco van der Hofstad the prize of the Institute Henri Poincaré. Slade was an invited speaker in 1994 at the ICM in Zürich with lecture The critical behaviour of random systems."

He studied at Harvard University in the United States. Unlike the other members of the family, he could not participate in industrial and financial activities due to a serious illness. He died at the age of only 35 in a Swiss clinic at Lake Geneva, where he had been treated for a long time. According to the poet Marta Vio, who was his companion for ten years, Giorgio had long suffered from schizophrenia. They met in 1946 on the beach of Forte dei Marmi, the holiday resort of the Agnelli family."

  "text" : "Grigorii Isaakovich Khanin (Russian: Григорий Исаакович Ханин, born 11 June 1937) is a Russian economist best known for his 1987 recalculation of official Soviet economic growth statistics. After the collapse of the USSR he began recalculating Russian economic statistics. His recalculations differed substantially from the official figures, particularly for the value of the capital stock. His work on the economic history of the USSR and Russia has always been controversial, but well grounded in the available (often adjusted by him) statistics. For example, he argued that NEP had exhausted itself and that therefore Stalin's break with it had a serious economic logic. He also argued that shortly before his death Stalin was planning a liberalisation policy. Khanin's recalculated statistics were estimated using a variant of the physical indicators method. They were based on the output data for a small number of sectors (e.g., electricity production and freight transport) which were used to generate estimates for mesoeconomic and macroeconomic data. These estimates were checked by using several variant values for the constituent data. Although crude, and difficult to replicate, this method may well have given a better picture of the economy than the official data. He has also integrated his alternative statistics into a series of books on the economic history of the USSR/Russia from the late 1930s to 1998. A feature of his work has been the utilisation of a wide range of published sources in both Russian and English. He published a whole book critically evaluating Western estimates of Soviet economic growth and has published a very positive review of R. W. Davies's work on the economic history of the USSR in the 1930s."

He was selected in the Australian team which was to tour South Africa in 1914-15 as one of the two wicket-keepers, as well as the manager and third selector; but war prevented the tour. During the First World War, he served in the First Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF) with the rank of major and, after the war ended, Campbell was appointed by the Australian Board of (Cricket) Control as its representative in dealings with the AIF Sports Control Board about the proposed AIF team which was formed out of military personnel as the Australian Imperial Force Touring XI."

In 1811 he purchased a half-share in a seagoing sloop, becoming one of the colony's earliest ship owners. Bankrupted within three years, Atkinson resumed to work as a police constable and labourer.

A blacksmith by trade, Captain Matthews was born in Ireland, but resided in Hamilton Township, Franklin County, Pennsylvania until his death. Matthews served as a representative to the Pennsylvania 1789 Constitutional Conventional and subsequently signed the 1790 Constitution. After problems became apparent with the Constitution of 1776, a campaign to change the Pennsylvania constitution followed. The 1790 Constitution has been described as a “model” constitution resembling modern day constitutions. It provided a workable frame of government with effective checks and balances to protect citizens from arbitrary government action."

  "text" : "Gaston Velle (1868–1953) was a French silent film director and pioneer of special effects, who was prominent in early French and Italian cinema during the first two decades of the 20th century. Like his father, the Hungarian entertainer Joseph \"Professor\" Velle, Gaston began his career as a travelling magician, before putting his illusionist skills to work in cinema and ultimately creating more than fifty films between 1903 and 1911. He worked under Auguste and Louis Lumière, before serving as the head of production for the Italian film studio Cinca. But he is best remembered for his work at Pathé, where he was hired to produce trick films that might rival those of his contemporary, Georges Méliès, including classic shorts like Burglars at Work (1904). Some films pioneered lasting techniques, such as his Les Invisibles (1906) – the first known invisible man film. Velle also created some of the first féerie films, such as tit-for-tat (1906). Additionally, Velle collaborated with other directors such as Segundo de Chomon and Ferdinand Zecca to create such silent film classics as the Moon Lover (1905), the Raja's Casket (1906), and the Hen that Laid the Golden Egg (1905), the latter of which was featured in the 1997 Martin Scorsese film, Kundun. Velle mysteriously retired from film production in 1913, and little is known about the last several decades of his life. Still, Velle remained part of a prominent cinematic family. Most notably, his son Maurice Velle, a Parisian cinematographer, had a family with screenwriter Mary Murillo."

She later moved to Hollywood. She was sometimes credited as Genia Nikolaieva or Eugenia Nikolajewa. Nikolaieva was born in St Petersburg to German-Russian parents, but moved to Germany at an early age. She starred in a series of stage revues which led to her being employed by the film industry. Because she was Jewish she found it increasingly difficult to gain roles following the Nazi takeover of Germany and in 1938 she went into exile in Hollywood. As well as making occasionally films, she also worked for Warner Brothers in an administrative role. In 1937, she married the film editor Carl Forcht."

  "text" : "Godfrey, Count Palatine of Lotharingia (c. 905 – 1 Jun aft. 949) was count of the Jülichgau from at least 924 to 936 and probably even until 949. He was the son of Gerhard I of Metz and Oda of Saxony, a daughter of Otto I, Duke of Saxony from the family of the Liudolfings, and thus a nephew of King Henry the Fowler. Moreover, he was the younger brother of Wigfried, who was archbishop of Cologne from 924 to 953 and arch-chancellor of his cousin King Otto I from 941. He married Ermentrude (b. 908/9), the eldest daughter of Charles the Simple, who probably owned the Duchy of Lorraine at the time and was thus his liege lord. Since Charles was deposed in 923, both as king and as duke, and taken prisoner a short time later, it is probable that the wedding took place shortly before the fall of Charles, especially since the other five daughters were apparently no longer married. For a time, Godfrey was known as Count Palatine of Lotharingia. The office was filled from 911 to 915 by Reginar and subsequently by Wigeric. Since Wigeric died before 922, and Charles was deposed 923, there is a short window of time in which Godfrey could have been used as deputy to his father-in-law in Lorraine. But since Godfrey was also the nephew of Henry I, the cousin of Otto I, and the brother of Otto's close adviser and later chancellor Wigfried, it is also possible that this office was entrusted to him after 923 despite his connection to the deposed Charles. The fact that his son Godfrey was himself Duke of Lower Lorraine in 959, and initially was as deputy to Archbishop Bruno of Cologne, Otto's brother and Wigfried's successor in both offices, suggests that his connections with Saxony were more important than those with West Francia. The children of Godfrey and Ermentrude were: \n* Godfrey I, b. 925/935, d. Summer 964 in Rome, Count of Hainaut, Duke of Lower Lorraine 959-964 \n* Gerberga, b. 925/935, d. bef. 24 May 996, married Megingoz of Guelders \n* Gerhard II, b. 925/935, 963 Count of Metz, Abbot of Remiremont. \n* Gebhard, b. 925/935 \n* Adalhard"

  "text" : "Galindo Mellado Cruz (18 April 1973 – 9 May 2014), commonly referred to by his alias El Mellado and/or Z-9, was a Mexican drug lord and one of the founders of Los Zetas, a criminal organization originally formed by ex-commandos from the Mexican Armed Forces. He joined the Mexican Army in 1992 and was part of the Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), an elite special forces unit of the Army. In 1999, he withdrew from the military and was recruited by the Gulf Cartel, a drug trafficking organization, shortly thereafter. With other ex-commandos, he formed Los Zetas, a group that worked as the Gulf Cartel's military wing. In 2010, the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas broke relations and Mellado Cruz sided with the former to maintain a low profile status. He was killed in a gunfight with Mexican security forces in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, on 9 May 2014."

She was from the so-called 1980s Pictures Generation of artists, which included Cindy Sherman, Robert Longo, Jack Goldstein, Laurie Simmons and Richard Prince. These artists mixed elements of Conceptual Art and Pop Art, using images from popular culture to examine its powerful codes. Bender also designed the credits for the TV show America's Most Wanted, which Roberta Smith of the New York Times suggested \"may have originated the rapid-fire hyperediting now pervasive in film, television and video art.\" She also directed music videos for such musicians as Babes in Toyland, edited music videos directed by Robert Longo, and designed sets for the choreographers Bill T. Jones and Molissa Fenley, including the former's Still/Here that New Yorker dance critic Arlene Croce condemned. Her work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Menil Collection in Houston."

He was active in Volterra by 1271, and later in Florence. He was previously cited as the Master of San Gaggio. In 1271, Grifo rented a workshop in Volterra together with Filippo di Jacopo. He appears to have worked painting the Fontana Maggiore in Perugia in 1281. By 1295, he had moved to Florence, and enrolled in the painters’ guild can be placed in the period between 1297 and 1312. In 1303 he executed a now lost painting in the Palazzo Vecchio, commemorating a political event of the day. Grifo is considered a follower of Giotto."

  "text" : "Giuseppe Barattolo (1882-1949) was an Italian lawyer, politician and film producer. In 1913, during the silent era, Barattolo founded Caesar Film. Caesar made a series of popular films, some of which starred Francesca Bertini. In 1919 he joined and became an influential figure at the conglomerate Unione Cinematografica Italiana which dominated Italian film production during the early 1920s, but this came to an end following the box office failure of Quo Vadis (1924). In the early 1930s he tried to re-establish Caesar Film as a serious force in Italian production, but this also failed. During the 1930s, Barattolo lobbied the Fascist government of Italy for aid to rebuild the Italian film industry. He was a strong supporter of the government's plans during the mid-1930s to invest large amounts of money constructing Cinecittà studios in Rome, and during the era he worked at the state-backed Scalera Film. Barattolo was instrumental in attempts to rebuild the Italian film industry in Venice during the Italian Social Republic. After the fall of Benito Mussolini Barattolo worked as an independent producer."

Born in 1889, he first signed for Hearts in the 1907/08 season. He was a traditional outside right (right winger). He went on to win three Scotland caps and also played three times for the Scottish League XI. In the 1914/15 season Hearts won their first 8 games to take a strong lead in the League. As a reservist, George had pledged to join up and was one of the first to leave Hearts in August 1914.Later the whole squad enlisted – the first British club to do so. Most of the players were with “C” Company of the Royal Scots – Sir George McCrae’s Battalion. George served with the Royal Field Artillery and was injured in action. George saw action at Mons and was one of the lucky ones who survived the war and returned to play for Hearts again, along with Paddy Crossan and Bob Mercer. In 1919 they reached the final of the Victory Cup. George continued to play football into the 1920s, including a spell in the United States. He went on to run Sinclair’s Bar in Montrose Terrace at Abbeyhill until he died in 1959."

  "text" : "Gennady Chkhaidze (Georgian: გენნადი ჩხაიძე; Uzbek: Геннадий Чхаидзе; born June 19, 1974 in Tbilisi) is a retired amateur Georgian Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's heavyweight category. Chkhaidze finished fifth in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004) under different banners Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, and later claimed a bronze medal in the men's heavyweight division at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, when he altered his allegiances with the Uzbekistan team. Before ending his sporting career in 2008, Chkhaidze trained for the Trade Union Sports Club in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, under head coach Kamil Fatkulin. Representing his native Georgia, Chkhaidze made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's heavyweight division (97 kg). During the preliminary pool, Chkhaidze upset Polish wrestler and two-time Olympic champion Andrzej Wroński with a striking effort, and fell Turkey's Hakkı Başar off the ring to earn a spot in the knockout rounds, scoring a cumulative total of six points and a set of two triumphs. Followed by the next day's session, Chkhaidze lost his quarterfinal match to U.S. wrestler and junior world champion Garrett Lowney in overtime, until he settled for a fifth-place finish in a consolation battle against Kazakhstan's Sergey Matviyenko. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Chkhaidze qualified under the new Kyrgyzstan team for the men's 96 kg class by receiving a berth and a gold medal from the Asian Championships in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Chkhaidze continued to deliver a more powerful performance by beating Bulgaria's Kaloyan Dinchev and Palau's John Tarkong in the preliminary pool, before he lost his quarterfinal match to Iranian wrestler Masoud Hashemzadeh. Despite receiving another defeat from Cuba's Ernesto Peña in a classification match, Chkhaidze upgraded his position again to fifth for the second time after Hashemzadeh was disqualified for a bronze medal protest. Shortly after the Games, Chkhaidze transferred his allegiance to the Uzbek team due to citizenship issues with Kyrgyzstan. When Chkhaidze competed for Uzbekistan at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, he flourished his wrestling career by picking up the bronze medal in his match against Iraq's Ali Nadhim after his sudden upset from South Korea's Han Tae-Young in the opening round."

He was born in Southborough, Kent and died at Winchester, Hampshire. Hone-Goldney was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler. He played in a lot of minor matches at Cambridge, but had appeared in only one first-class game when picked for the University match in 1873: in this game, he batted at No 11 and bowled only two overs, without success. He made a similarly scant impression in his third and final first-class match in 1876, though the game itself, between a team called The Gentlemen of the Marylebone Cricket Club and Kent, was rendered notable by the feat of W. G. Grace in scoring 344, the highest first-class score to that point and the first innings of more than 300."

  "text" : "Greg Wohlwend is an American independent video game developer and artist whose games include Threes!, Ridiculous Fishing, Hundreds, Gasketball, Puzzlejuice, and Solipskier. He originally formed Intuition Games with Iowa State University classmate Mike Boxleiter in 2007 where they worked on Dinowaurs and other small Adobe Flash games. Trained as an artist, Wohlwend worked mainly on the visual assets. As Mikengreg, they released Solipskier (2010, iOS), whose success let the two take a more experimental approach with Gasketball, which did not fare as well. At the same time, Wohlwend collaborated with Asher Vollmer to make Puzzlejuice and with Adam Saltsman to make Hundreds based on Wohlwend's first game design. He later released Threes! with Vollmer in 2014 to critical acclaim. He was named among Forbes' 2014 \"30 under 30\" in the games industry. Mikengreg released TouchTone in 2015 following two years of development."

In first-class cricket, Downton was an amateur right-handed lower-order batsman and wicketkeeper; he acted as Godfrey Evans' deputy in Kent's 1948 side, playing first-team cricket when Evans was on Test duty. Although he did play for Kent's first team after 1948, he appeared in the second team for Minor Counties matches through to 1954. Prominent in club cricket for Orpington Cricket Club, he also played for the Club Cricket Conference which organised warm-up non-first-class games against overseas teams touring England and against the universities in the 1950s and 1960s; in this vein of good-class amateur cricket, he played a couple of further first-class matches for MCC in the late 1950s. Downton was the father of Paul Downton, also a batsman and wicketkeeper, who played for England in the 1980s."

  "text" : "Grace Locke Scobie OBE (3 July 1876 – 2 June 1957) was an Australian factory inspector and women's activist. She was born in Bombay to Scottish-born saddler Robert Scobie and Elizabeth Buchanan, née Farms. Around 1878 the Scobies moved to Menindee in New South Wales. In 1901, when Robert was elected as a Labor MP to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, they moved to Sydney, where Grace worked as her father's secretary. She was appointed inspector of factories and industrial inspector in the Department of Labour and Industry in 1916, tending to support employers over employees; she and her father both left the Labor Party as pro-conscriptionists that year. Scobie campaigned for conscription in the two referenda, served as a council member of the National Association of New South Wales from 1917 to 1918, and was given the OBE in 1918. In 1920 Labor News censured her for condoning harsh treatment of illegitimate children as a board member of the State Children Relief Board. In that year she ran for the Soldiers and Citizens Party for the state seat of Eastern Suburbs, but was not successful. From the 1920s Scobie was a member of the National Council of Women of New South Wales, but in 1924 the political department for which she worked refused her permission to attend daytime meetings and she was forced to resign. By 1927 she had moved well away from the council, and was president of the Professional Women Workers' Association. She ran for election again in 1932, contesting Bondi as an independent supported by the United Associations of Women, of which she was secretary. During the 1930s she worked to reduce maternal and infant mortality, and was involved with the Australian Federation of Women Voters and the Feminist Club. She died at Bondi in 1957."

  "text" : "Major Joseph Gordon Smith (23 October 1920 - 22 April 2014) was a soldier who served with the 2nd Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. Smith served in Malaya during the Second World War and survived being held as a prisoner of war by the Japanese. During his imprisonment, Smith experienced many hardships and was forced to work on the Burma Railway, an experience which was illustrated by the film The Bridge on the River Kwai. Smith went to Melville College and was a medical student at the University of Edinburgh for two years before enlisting during the war. Smith was sent to fight in Malaya at the age of 21 and suffered three gunshot wounds during the Battle of Slim River. After marching for three weeks he was taken prisoner at Pudu Prison in Kuala Lumpur. After a few months he was taken to Tamarkan as forced labour to work on the railway there. Initially Smith worked on the construction of railway bridges over the river, but the compound was converted to a hospital camp which allowed him to use his medical training to help fellow prisoners. In 1945, Smith was facing execution by his captors but was saved by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki which brought about the end of the war and Smith's liberation. He was said to have displayed \"immense courage\" to survive the horrific treatment he endured as a prisoner, and by the end of the war, he weighed only 6 stone. His resourcefulness in helping other prisoners was also noted: he made surgical tools to treat prisoners, sedating them with chloroform; he created a distillation unit to obtain clean water; he fixed a radio smuggled into the prison; and he found a way to diagnose malaria in his fellow prisoners earlier. After the war, Smith served in Germany on bomb disposal work for the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. In 1945, he moved to De Havilland to work on the Blue Streak (missile), and later on the Europa (rocket) project. Smith was awarded the 1939–45 Star, the Pacific Star, and the War Medal 1939–1945. Smith published his memoirs, entitled War Memories: A Medical Student in Malaya and Thailand in 2008."

She is very popular especially among younger generation due to her unique approach to combine some Bollywood steps and Yoga into the Kathak while taking care not to cross the boundaries of tradition.

His recordings of Handel have tended to final versions, unknown works such as pasticcios. His recordings of Greek composers include the Don Crepuscolo of Nikolaos Mantzaros, performed by bass Christophoros Stamboglis (MDG, LC06768, 2011)"

  "text" : "George Johnston (c. 1700 – August 29, 1766) was a lawyer in Fairfax County, Virginia while it was a British colony. He was twice elected to the House of Burgesses, in the assemblies of 1758-61 and 1761-65. On May 30, 1765 Johnston seconded Patrick Henry's speech advocating for resolutions against the Stamp Act. Johnston was elected to a third term, but died before the assembly reconvened. His death was reported in the Virginia Gazette on September 19, 1766. Johnston married Sarah McCarty (1724 - 1785), daughter of Major Dennis McCarty from Westmoreland County, Virginia. He had three children by Sarah: George, William, and Mary Massey. His son, Lt. Col George Johnston, Jr., was Aide-de-camp and confidential military secretary to General George Washington from December 1776 until his death at Morristown, New Jersey in June 1777. As a burgess, Johnston made a motion to resolve the House into a committee of the whole, seconded by Patrick Henry, at which time their coalition brought forth a shocking series of resolutions now known as the Stamp Act Resolutions. The House of Burgesses was an aristocratic company of wealthy plantation owners and gentlemen, having long operated under a relaxed rule of 24 percent constituting a quorum. With only 39 members in attendance, Johnston's motion passed, and in the absence of the House's regular leadership, all five of the offered resolutions were adopted. The first four were adopted more quickly than the fifth, which required several hours of heated debate, and even after that, passed by only one vote. George Johnston served as George Washington's attorney, and a trustee of the town of Alexandria, Virginia. At the time of his death, Washington succeeded Johnston to both positions. His son, George Johnston, served as a captain in the 5th Company, 15th Regiment of Virginia."

In 2010, she ran at the elections for the Province of Cagliari with the Christian Popular Union (which supported the centre-right candidate Graziano Milia), winning 16 votes. Later, she joined the Five Star Movement, with which she was elected at the 2014 European elections. Her candidature was met with some controversy by some Sardinians activists of the Movement, who later issued an open letter asking for more clarifications about her research activities: according to them, she «...did not provide any evidence, nor they can be found on the Internet». Giulia Moi rebuked the accusations, adding that «...researchers know that data from research programmes financed by international companies may be subject to restrictions, due to very strict contractual bindings.»."

  "text" : "Georgios Koutsioumpas (Greek: Γεώργιος Κουτσιούμπας; born May 18, 1981 in Trikala) is an amateur Greek Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's heavyweight category. Koutsioumpas represented his home nation Greece at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, and later picked up a silver medal in the 96-kg division at the 2005 Mediterranean Games in Almería, Spain. Throughout his sporting career, Koutsioumpas, along with his older brother Xenofon, trained as a member of the Greco-Roman wrestling team for Olympiacos F.C. in Piraeus, and since 2012 they have been training at Atlas Mytilenes under their head coach Sotirios Petrakis. Koutsioumpas qualified as a member of the Greek squad in the men's 96 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens by receiving an allocated place and an automatic spot for the host nation from the International Federation of Associated Wrestling (French: Fédération Internationale des Luttes Associées, FILA). By the delight of the boisterous home crowd inside the Ano Liossa Olympic Hall, Koutsioumpas opened his match by edging Kazakhstan's Asset Mambetov out of the mat with an effortless throw, but suffered a tedious 6–11 blowout from Egypt's Karam Gaber on his second bout. Despite a single loss, Koutsioumpas continued to grapple powerfully against Poland's Marek Sitnik and paid off by a 3–2 sudden death decision. Finishing third in the prelim pool, Koutsioumpas' performance fell short to put him through into the quarterfinals, as he left his home crowd in agony. When Iran's Masoud Hashemzadeh was disqualified for an illegal protest during the bronze medal match, Koutsioumpas' position was eventually upgraded to seventh."

  "text" : "Girindra Mukerji was an Indian anti-British revolutionary, organizer, and agriculturist. His article \"The Hindu in America\" has been widely cited as an early document describing early Indian immigration to the United States. Mukerji was born in India, and according to the San Francisco Chronicle, the son of a \"Judge of one of the higher courts.\" In 1901, he received an AB degree from Calcutta University. He moved to the United States and became a student at the University of California, Berkeley circa 1905. His time at UC Berkeley was widely covered by American press. In summer 1905, according to Gopal Stavig, Mukerji represented the Vedanta Society at the Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Mukerji was the President of the Association of Oriental Students at UC Berkeley during at least 1907-1908. In November 1907, he published a booklet on American colleges focused on an Indian audience; the release was covered in the San Francisco Chronicle. A subsequent article, \"The Hindu in America,\" was published in the Overland Monthly in April 1908. In December 1907, Mukerji gave a scathing lecture on the British empire in India to UC Berkeley's Economics Club, which was covered in the San Francisco Chronicle, in an article titled \"Hindu Arraigns Britons for the Ruin of India: Calcutta Graduate Scores England for Overtaxing of His People.\" In January 1908 he led a student protest against J. Lovell Murray, a Christian evangelist who was in Berkeley to give a talk titled \"Awakening the Orient\" organized by the local Y.M.C.A. Just before Murray was about to enter Stiles Hall to give his lecture, 16 of the 17 Indian students at UC Berkeley, including Mukerji, requested Murray to remove from his talk any references to the immorality of Hindu priests, and its use in the justification of the occupation of India by the British. Murray refused. Once Murray was finished speaking, Mukerji was invited to respond to speaker. He spoke against the British occupation, followed by six other students from the group, until the organizers decided to shut down the event. Mukerji was a student of Professor Eugene W. Hilgard, an expert on agricultural chemistry. In 1907-1908, he received a Master of Science from the College of Agriculture at UC Berkeley; his thesis was entitled \"A Comparative Study of Soil Columns in the San Joaquin Valley.\" University President Wheeler, who was present at his farewell, spoke highly of his work and cited him as a role model for other Indians. In 1907, the Berkeley Daily Gazette reported that Mukerji was to \"return to his home to take the chair of agriculture at the Calcuttat (sic) University.\" Mukerji left for New York in March 1908. In a 1911 article, Sarangadhar Das wrote that after graduating from UC Berkeley in 1908, Mukerji \"worked as the Superindending (sic) Chemist in a sugar factory in Porto Rico, Cuba, and now is employed in the Bengal National College. Mukerji was Hindustani Interpreter in the employ of the Immigration Department.\""

By end of 1828 the process extension of British dominion into Assam was completed. With the assumption of the political power by the officers of the East India Company, the ruling Ahom monarchy lost not only their political authority but social privileges too. The feudal structure of the society began to crumble as new measures were adopted by the colonial rulers to strip the nobility of their rights and privileges. Their enthusiasm for their new friend, who aided them in driving out the Burmese from Assam, soon disappeared and supportes of monarchy began the organize themselves the restore the old Ahom monarchy and oust the British. Gomdhar was formally enthroned near Jorhat according to Ahom rites, and arms and ammunitions were collected. But before he could make much headway a counter offensive was made by the British led by Lieutenant Rutherford. The rebels lost and Gomdhar fled to the Naga Hills. But, soon he and his associates were arrested by the British. Gomdhar was found guilty of “illegally assuming the Insignia of Royalty” and sentenced to death. This sentence was subsequently commuted to seven years of imprisonment in banishment and was deported to an unknown location to die in ignominy."

Born around 1451 or 1452 in Vicenza, under the rule of Venice since 1404, Angiolello left Venice in 1468, took part in the defense of Negroponte, besieged by the Ottoman emperor Mehmed II. Enslaved by the Turks, he was taken to Constantinople. He was with the Ottoman armies in Persia, in the Balkan Peninsula and Asia (1472-1481). After about 1483 Angiolello’s career is uncertain. He came back to his home town Vicenza, married and became a functionary. He possibly had two missions (perhaps for the Venetian Republic) or stayed (as an agent or merchant) in Persia around 1482 (after Sultan Mehmed’s death) and then in between 1499 and 1515. He died around 1525. In addition to a report on his first trip, it is almost certainly the author of a Turkish History, valuable source for the history of the sultanates of Mahomet II and Bayezid II."

  "text" : "Gregory Ivor Smith (4 November 1939 – 19 February 2009) was a British film producer who had successes in the world of theatre and television. Smith was born in Twickenham and raised in Laindon by his aunt after his parents died. At the age of 15, Smith joined the Argyle Theatre Touring Company where acting assignments included a stint as an ugly sister in a production of Cinderella. After working as an office boy for Bernard Delfont, and an talent agent for MVA and the Billy Marsh Agency, Smith formed his own talent agency based out of London's Golden Square. In the late sixties Smith worked as a production associate on two documentary shorts made by Norcon films, Brendan Behan's Dublin (1966) and The London Nobody Knows (1967) beginning a long association and friendship with their director Norman Cohen (1936–1983). With Smith producing and Cohen directing, the two men would go on to make the film adaptation of Spike Milligan's Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall (1973). Smith followed this with the Confessions... series of sex comedy films, with Michael Klinger as the executive producer and Cohen directing all but the first. The series comprises Confessions of a Window Cleaner (directed by Val Guest, 1974), Confessions of a Pop Performer (1975), Confessions of a Driving Instructor (1976) and lastly Confessions from a Holiday Camp (1977). The Confessions series put Smith and Cohen in direct competition with the Carry On series of films. \"Things have changed since the Carry-Ons\" Smith remarked to Films Illustrated in September 1975: \"Humour is more sophisticated, people are more aware. Not that I'm running down the Carry-Ons for one moment. They're one of my favourite types of film, and always have been. But maybe they're a little dated now.\" A commercial, but diverse, filmmaker, Smith’s other work from this period included producing the glam rock extravaganza Never Too Young to Rock (1976), the documentary  The Importance of Being Dublin (1974) and the third film adaptation of The Thirty-Nine Steps (1978). Plans for a 1978 film adaptation of Dennis Potter’s Pennies from Heaven (meant to have been produced by Smith for Norfolk International Productions) did not come to fruition, however, nor did plans to make a fifth Confessions film ‘Confessions from a Haunted House’ in 1978. Smith began turning more to producing for television, including the well-remembered Shillingbury Tales (1980), working in the field until the late 1990s. In 1989 he enjoyed huge success as the co-producer of the hit musical Buddy - the Buddy Holly Story, which ran for twelve years in London's West End."

  "text" : "Philip Barnes of Choral Journal describes him as \"prominent among his British contemporaries by reason of a prolific output and engaging style\". Jackson's work includes a significant body of organ compositions, piano and other instrumental works, but he is probably best known for his vocal music, especially for his deft use of text. While he cites Michael Tippett and Igor Stravinsky as influences, he is also drawn to soul and R&B, and this influence is noticeable in his music. Jackson was a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral before studying composition at the Royal College of Music, first under Richard Blackford then with John Lambert. He was awarded the R.O. Morris Prize for Composition in 1981 and 1983, and in 1981 also won the Theodore Holland Award. Notable compositions include the commissioned piece for the 2009 Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King’s College Cambridge, a new work to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Tallis Scholars in 2012 and a full-length Passion for Merton College, Oxford in 2013."

  "text" : "Guido Lauri (born November 23, 1922) is an Italian dancer, actor, choreographer, ballet master, company director. Born in Rome, he entered the ballet school of then royal Rome Opera House at 6 years-old and in 1939, after a graduation with full marks, he joined the ballet company with the title of primo ballerino étoile. A very handsome man, an eclectic artist, a danseur noble with hot-blooded temperament, he excelled in all the classics partnering famous ballerinas such as French Yvette Chauviré and Liane Daydée, French/Russian Ludmilla Tchérina and Italian Attilia Radice, often danced in neoclassical titles by Mikhail Fokin, Vaslav Nijinsky, Léonide Massine and created numerous roles for choreographer Aurel Milloss. As a guest star, soon after the Second World War and during the 50s, he was very much in demand in Italy (La Scala in Milan, Teatro Regio in Turin, La Fenice in Venice, Teatro Comunale in Bologna, Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, Teatro Massimo in Palermo) and abroad (Metropolitan Opera House in New York and Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires as well as in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Portugal and Spain). As a ballet master and choreographer, he directed the Rome Opera Ballet between 1965 and 1983 (collaborating with Erik Bruhn, Rudolf Nureyev, Roland Petit, Ninette De Valois, Pierre Lacotte) and, as a member of jury, he was invited by close friend Yuri Grigorovich in world-class dance competitions like those of Varna, Tokyo and Osaka. He worked for theatre with Luchino Visconti, for television with Vittorio Gassman, for cinema with Bernardo Bertolucci and he was in Hollywood at the invitation of Margarete Wallmann. Some of most talented artists of the time such as De Chirico, Guttuso, Picasso and prince Enrico D’Assia had designed costumes and scene-painting for him. He was awarded the Berlin's Golden Bear prize in 1941, the Rome's Tiber's twins in 1964, the Florence's Michelangelo's David in 1978 and in 1982 American Who's Who choose him as one of the greatest prides of the Italian ballet of the 20th century. Married to classical dancer Anna Maria Paganini and father of ballerina Tiziana Lauri, he also counts among his relatives a large number of acclaimed dancers, famed athlete Eliseo Paganini and celebrated operatic bass Giulio Neri."

Otis Americus Kinsolving (1822-1894), minister at Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Middleburg, Virginia became an avid Confederate, especially supporting Mosby's Rangers although G.H. Kinsolving's brother joined the Richmond Howitzers light artillery. The family of his father's second wife likewise supported the Confederacy (her father Asa Rogers became a local militia general), and after her death from complications of childbirth, Rev. Otis Kinsolving was imprisoned for treason by occupying Union forces. The child that whose birth led to that death, Lucian Lee Kinsolving (1862-1929), later became the first missionary bishop of Brazil, and G.H. Kinsolving preached the sermon at the consecration ceremony attended by twelve bishops. His other half-brother by his father's second wife, Rev. Arthur Barksdale Kinsolving (1861-1961), also became known as an author and historian in Maryland. His half-brother by his father's third wife, Rev.

  "text" : "George Adam Dickel (February 2, 1818 – June 11, 1894) was a German-born American businessman best known for his namesake brand of whiskey, George Dickel, one of two major brands of Tennessee whiskey. Though he was not the distiller of the whiskey, which was originally sold under the brand name \"Cascade\", his wholesaling firm played an important role in its distribution and marketing, and his name appeared on its labels throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. When Cascade's new owners reopened the original Cascade Hollow distillery in the 1950s, they renamed the whiskey for Dickel. Though he valued anonymity and preferred to work in the background in business dealings, Dickel was a prominent resident of his adopted hometown of Nashville, Tennessee. He owned a number of smaller business enterprises, at various times, in addition to his liquor wholesaling business."

In January 1862 he became a privat-docent of theology at Erlangen, where he later became an associate professor (1867) and a full professor of theology (1876). Beginning in 1877, he assisted Johann Jakob Herzog with a new edition of \"Realenzyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche\" (Edition 2: 18 volumes, 1877-1888). Upon Plitt's death in 1880, edition and publication of the encyclopedia was continued by Herzog and church historian Albert Hauck."

Their father had been an army officer for the Royal administration. One of Giovanni's brothers, Ferdinando, was a secretary of the Banco di San Giacomo. The biographer Bernardo De Dominici mainly recalled Gennaro, but mentioned that Antonio and Giovanni, then still alive were excellent pupils of Matteis. Antonio worked with Giovanni in frescoes for Palazzo Partanna, now home to the Industrial Union of Naples. Giovanni also painted a Consecration of the Virgin (1766) for the church of Santa Anna at Sessa Aurunca. He also painted Scenes of the Life of Beato Franco (1751), St Januarius and St Irene and St Gregory celebrates Mass (1774) for the church of Santa Maria del Carmine. He painted a Conversion of St Paul for the church of the Padri della Missione ai Vergini, and a St Joseph and Child Jesus (1787) for the Archconfraternity of San Giuseppe dei Nudi in Naples."

  "text" : "Born in La Spezia into a family of Pisan origins, Biagetti studied medicine at the university of Pisa, and during this time he founded the stage company \"The brigade of Doctors\", for which he wrote several comic-grotesque plays. He moved to Rome in the early fifties, and there he had some experience as a documentarist and as an assistant director of notable directors including Joseph Losey, Giorgio Ferroni, Giacomo Gentilomo and Roberto Rossellini, who produced and wrote the feature film debut of Biagetti, the melodrama Rivalità. After a badly distributed second work Biagetti abandoned films, devoting himself to the production and direction of commercials. He came back to cinema in 1968, directing two commercially successful films which had some political and social commitment, then since 1972 he focused on more low-profile genre films, in which he was sometimes credited as Pier Giorgio Ferretti."

  "text" : "Georges de Morsier (25 February 1894, Paris – 9 January 1982, Geneva) was a French-Swiss neurologist. He studied natural sciences and medicine in Geneva, and following graduation, returned to Paris as an assistant to psychiatrist Gaétan de Clérambault. In 1928 he became a privat-docent for neurology and psychiatry. In 1941 he became an associate professor at Geneva, where in 1960, he was appointed professor of neurology and director of the university neurological clinic. From 1962 onward, he was also in charge of the neurological polyclinic. Known for his research of visual hallucinations, he is credited with coining the terms \"Charles Bonnet syndrome\" (named after Swiss biologist Charles Bonnet) and \"Zingerle syndrome\" (named after Austrian neurologist Hermann Zingerle) for specific hallucinatory conditions. He also honored his mentor, Gaétan de Clérambault, with a syndrome — it being defined as a hallucinatory state characterized by auditory and visual hallucinations associated with chronic psychosis. The condition was earlier described by Clérambault in the context with his research on mental automatisms. The eponym \"De Morsier's syndrome\" is a synonym for septo-optic dysplasia."

After finishing his studies, he worked as a schoolteacher in his hometown of Göttingen, later being appointed rector at the Progymnasiums in Einbeck. With Germanist Wilhelm Konrad Hermann Müller, he was co-author of a book on Lower Saxon legends and fairy tales, titled \"Niedersächsische Sagen und Märchen\" (1855). The book contained 261 folk tales and 34 fairy tales, which, for the most part, were collected by Schambach on interviews taken while travelling through the former principalities of Göttingen and Grubenhagen."

  "text" : "George P. Shadid (born May 15, 1929) is an American Democratic politician. He was sheriff of Peoria County, Illinois from 1976 to 1993 and was in the Illinois State Senate from 1993 until 2006. Shadid was born in Clinton, Iowa to immigrants from Lebanon. At age 14, once in Peoria, Illinois, Shadid worked with future mayor Jim Maloof at the Maloof family cleaning business. They remained friends until Maloof's death. Shadid became a police officer in 1953. In 1976, he ran for sheriff of Peoria County. Running as a Democrat, with a Republican campaign manager, he became the first Democrat elected as Peoria County sheriff since 1892. He took up the office of sheriff in December 1976. The 1985 jail and sheriff's complex on Maxwell Road was built during his tenure. By 1993, Shadid was living near Edwards. In 1993, the Illinois State Senate 46th Senate District seat was vacated by Richard Luft of Pekin when Luft was appointed Illinois Commissioner of Banks and Trusts. Shadid was unanimously chosen as a replacement by Democratic leaders of the district, and was appointed to the Illinois State Senate on May 13, 1993. Al Meister was appointed to replace Shadid as sheriff. Shadid retired from the Senate in December 2006 to allow his elected successor, Democrat David Koehler, to take office earlier. In 2013, Shadid donated his remaining campaign funds to Bradley University. In November 2014, the Peoria County jail complex on Maxwell Road was named the George P. Shadid Law Enforcement Center."

  "text" : "Augustus D. \"Gus\" Jenkins (March 24, 1931 – December 22, 1985) was an American blues and R&B pianist, vocalist and bandleader. Credited as Gus Jinkins, he had a no.2 hit on the Billboard R&B chart in 1956 with the instrumental \"Tricky\". He sometimes used the stage names The Young Wolf, Little Temple, and Piano Bo, and from the late 1960s took the name Jaarone Pharoah. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and developed his piano style influenced by St. Louis blues pianist Walter Davis. He toured with Sammy Green's Hot Harlem Review, and backed singers Big Mama Thornton and Percy Mayfield, before reaching Chicago in the late 1940s. Jenkins first recorded for the Chess label in January 1953, accompanied by Walter Horton (harmonica) and Willie Nix (drums), but his recordings, including \"Eight Ball\", were not released for some years. He also accompanied David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards on some of his recordings at Chess. Later in 1953 he recorded \"Cold Love\" and other tracks as Little Temple for the Specialty label in Los Angeles, with Jimmy Liggins (harmonica), Ted Brinson (bass), and an unknown drummer. He remained in Los Angeles for the rest of his career, and learned woodworking while continuing to perform, with Johnny Otis' band and others, and record. He recorded \"I Miss My Baby\" for Jake Porter's Combo label in 1955, before recording \"Tricky\" in 1956 for the Flash label owned by Charlie Reynolds. The single reached no.2 on the R&B chart and no.79 on the Billboard pop chart in late 1956. He released several further singles on Flash, including \"Spark Plug\" and \"Payday Shuffle\", before forming his own label, Pioneer International, with Clayton Metzler in 1959. He released a string of records on the label until 1962, many being piano and organ instrumentals released under his own name, and some featuring vocalist Mamie Perry. He later recorded for the General Artist label, but without further commercial success. However, his single \"Chittlins\" was released by Tower Records, a subsidiary of Capitol, in 1964. By 1970, Jenkins had converted to Islam, and used the name Jaarone Pharoah. He continued to perform around Los Angeles, until his death in 1985 at the age of 54."

He was taught by his father, and was influenced by Bartolomeo di Tommaso. There is evidence that he worked with his father on a church commission in Gradara (1429), and continued working with him through at least 1437. After his father died, Bellinzoni came into his own right, and was in high demand. He executed frescoes depicting Our Lady of Mercy and Our Lady Enthroned in the Church of the Blessed Sacrament, Saltara. He continued working steadily in and around Pesaro until his death in 1477. A biography written about his life won the Salimbeni Prize in 1991 for excellence in the writing of art history on an Italian subject."

  "text" : "George Kingsmill (1808–1852) was the High Constable of Toronto in 1835 and from 1837 to 1846. Kingsmill was born in Queen's County, Ireland. He joined the British Army and, after being decommissioned, settled in Toronto in 1829 and ran a provision store on Market Street where he supplied sailing vessels and steamers passing through the city's port. He was appointed High Constable in 1835, was succeeded by James Stitt in 1836 and was then re-appointed to the position in 1837. In 1835, he was appointed the second High Constable of Toronto, however, he was the first to not also be the city's only constable. During his tenure, in 1835, the Toronto Police Department was first organized when the city retained five full-time constables, the first organized police force in Canada. Kingsmill was a member of the Orange Order and he recruited his constables from the Order's ranks, a practice later found by a provincial commission of inquiry to have led the police to take a highly sectarian character. This was a period of sectarian conflict in Toronto between the Protestant majority and the largely Irish Catholic minority and the police often supported their fellow Orangemen during anti-Catholic rioting. During the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837, Kingsmill aided the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, Sir Francis Bond Head, in putting down the uprising. and in the years following the 1837 Rebellion also were used by incumbent Tory politicians to break up meetings of Reformers. Kingsmill retired from business in 1842 and died in Galt in 1852. Kingsmill's nephew, Thomas Frazer Kingsmill, settled in London, Ontario and established Kingsmill's Department Store in 1865 which remained in operation until 2014."

  "text" : "Guidoccio Cozzarelli (1450-1517) was an Italian Renaissance painter and miniaturist. Cozzarelli was born in Siena, and was a student and collaborator of Matteo di Giovanni, with whom it is sometimes possible to confuse him due to their similar styles, and has led to some difficulty in painting attributions. Compared to Matteo, Cozzarelli's style is less fine, but more adept in chiaroscuro and color scheme. Cozzarelli primarily painted religious-themed works for church commissions, and became more popular as a miniaturist and painter, which includes the parchment preserved in the state in Siena, and the thumbnails stored in Siena Cathedral (1480s). This is considered his most fertile period in which Cozzarelli produced the Baptism of Christ and the Madonna and Saints (1486) in the church of San Bernardino in Sinalunga. He also painted Madonna Enthroned with St Jerome and the Blessed Colombini (1482). In the following years he worked for the Duomo di Pitigliano, the parish church of Ancaiano (1491) and the church of San Michele Arcangelo in Paganico, including Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints. In the Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena) are exhibited various works of the painter, including San Antonio, and Santa Caterina surrounded by Doctors and Pharmacists."

  "text" : "George Macan (9 September 1853 – 2 November 1943) was an Irish-born lawyer and reporter, and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University between 1872 and 1875. He was born at Castlebellingham, County Louth, Ireland and died at Wimbledon, London. Macan was educated at Harrow School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. As a cricketer, Macan was a right-handed middle- or lower-order batsman and a right-arm slow bowler, though he did not bowl in first-class cricket. He played in a single match for Cambridge University in 1872, and then reappeared fairly regularly in 1873, scoring 57 against an \"England XI\" which was a rather pale shadow of the All-England cricket teams that played as \"England\" in the period before international cricket began; the 57 was his highest first-class score, but he was unsuccessful in other matches and was not picked for the 1873 University Match against Oxford University. In one match, he played for \"the Gentlemen of England\" against the university side. Though he failed to pass 50 again, he was more consistently successful in both 1874 and 1875 and played in the University Match in both seasons. In 1874, he made 6 and 12 as a poor Cambridge batting side was overwhelmed by an innings and 92 runs; in 1875, he made 2 and 1 not out as Cambridge lost by just six runs. He played no further first-class cricket after leaving Cambridge, but is recorded in non-first-class scorecards from Marylebone Cricket Club and other amateur sides up to 1890. Macan graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1875 and then qualified as a lawyer, being called to the bar in 1877. He did not practise as a barrister, but instead acted as a court reporter, working for the Law Times Reports in the Chancery Division."

  "text" : "Gustav Roethe (5 May 1859, Graudenz – 17 September 1926, Bad Gastein) was a German philologist. He studied classical and Germanic philology in Göttingen, Leipzig and Berlin, obtaining his PhD in 1881 (doctoral advisor, Friedrich Zarncke). In 1888 he succeeded Karl Goedeke as an associate professor of German philology at the University of Göttingen, and two years later, succeeded Wilhelm Konrad Hermann Müller as a full professor of German language and literature. In 1902 he relocated to the University of Berlin, where in 1923/24 he served as rector. His studies largely dealt with Middle High German literature, German Romanticism and \"Goethe-research\". His \"Reinmar of Zweter\" formed the basis for research involving the history of Middle High German Sangspruchdichtung (epigrammatic poetry). From 1908 onward, he was tasked with reorganization of the \"Deutsches Wörterbuch\" of the Brothers Grimm. From 1891 to 1926, with Edward Schröder, he was editor of the \"Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur\". In 1921 he was named president of the Goethe Society."

  "text" : "George \"The Flying Greek\" Tambakis was born in Mykonos, Greece, on 21 July 1989. Tambakis migrated to Brisbane, Australia, in 1999. In Brisbane he was awarded a scholarship to play rugby at St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace. Enrolling in 2002, he excelled and quickly became an integral member of the First XV rugby team going on to represent Queensland at the Under-16 National Championship in 2005. After leaving school, Tambakis went on to play for Easts Tigers Rugby Union in the Brisbane Club Rugby Competition  where he quickly gain the nickname \"The Flying Greek\" for his 'barnstorming' runs out of the centres. Tambakis went on to represent Queensland in the under-19 team. Following a run of impressive displays for Easts Tigers, he was selected to represent Greece in rugby league in the lead up to the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, but Greece did not qualify for the World Cup Finals. Tambakis left behind his stunning sister, Sofia (Ms. Greece Regional Australia 2014), to move to Sydney, Australia, in 2015 where he began studying medicine at the University of Notre Dame Australia. Currently, Tambakis resides in Melbourne, Australia, where he turns out for the Melbourne University Rugby Football Club (MURFC) in 5th grade. He may have lost some outright pace over the years, due to excessive book work, but he has lost none of his tenacity and work rate. Whilst not playing football or cooking books, George is in the final stages of planning a family with his life-partner, Mouldy Mouldsworth."

  "text" : "Frank Gale Pedrick Harvey (1906–1970) was an English author, journalist, scriptwriter, and broadcaster known as Gale Pedrick. Pedrick was born on 15 June 1906, in London, England, and was educated at Sir Roger Manwood's School at Sandwich. He began work as a newspaper journalist, first for the Western Mail in Plymouth, in 1920, then for the Daily Dispatch in Manchester, before moving to London to be a theatre critic and feature writer for The Star. He began broadcasting for the BBC in 1926, but during World War II served in the Devonshire Regiment and worked for the British Forces Broadcasting Service, which he was managing by 1944, from a studio in Algiers. Between 1946 and 1949 he was a script editor for the BBC. He also created and produced Pick of the Week, a compilation of the week's broadcast highlights, which he selected. His works for the BBC included scripts for television, including the first 35 episodes of the UK version of This Is Your Life, and radio, from which there was at least one spin-off book, the crime fiction Meet the Rev. He also wrote the novelisation tie-ins for Steptoe and Son. He co-wrote George Formby's last film, George in Civvy Street. He appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 15 February 1965. Pedrick collapsed and died at Tottenham Court Road station on 23 February 1970, aged 64. An obituary was published in The Times the next day."

  "text" : "Garfield Thorsrud (February 20, 1928 - November 23, 2014) was a Montana pilot and smoke jumper who was initially contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency to fly aircraft for the Tibetan insertion operation, encrypted STBARNUM, in the early 1950s. He was one of the first eight smokejumpers recruited out of the University of Montana by the Central Intelligence Agency in Spring 1951. He was subsequently offered a staff position in Special Operating Group and, together with Major (later Brigadier General) Heinie Aderholt—who had been seconded to the Agency from the US Air Force—stood up a separate paramilitary air wing—later formalized as Air Branch. SOG/Air Branch (and Thorsrud) subsequently played a major role in virtually every Agency covert action in the Third World during the cold war and beyond. In 1956, Thorsrud established an air operations base carved out of the jungle in a western pacific location and from there he oversaw air delivery of men and supplies to support President Eisenhower's program to de-stabilize the Sukarno regime in Indonesia. When the Soviets abandoned an arctic weather and listening station in the mid-1960s, after the ice pack it was built on broke adrift, Thorsrud organized the air assets from Intermountain Aviation for Operation Cold Feet, a remarkable joint CIA-US Navy operation that put 2 officers on the floating ice flow to recover a treasure trove of documents, instruments and equipment abandoned there by the Soviets. Thorsrud then successfully extracted the two officers by means of a \"cow catcher\" attached to a converted B-17 bomber that snagged a line attached to an inflated balloon and connected to the men by harness. This incredible feat in the arctic slowly leaked out and became the basis for the spy thriller film \"Ice Station Zebra.\" During the early years of China operations, Air Branch assumed control of several private Asian cargo airlines and turned them into CIA proprietary companies. These included Civil Air Transport (CAT), purchased from its founder General Claire Chennault, as well as Air America, and lesser known air proprietaries such as BirdAir, and Southern Air Transport. Thorsrud later founded Mountain West Aviation in 1975 which in turn became Sierra Pacific Airlines."

  "text" : "Godwin Kipkemoi Chepkurgor (c. 1969 – August 1, 2014) was a Kenya freelance journalist and former Nakuru city councillor. In 2000, Chepkurgor offered then U.S. President Bill Clinton a dowry of forty goats and twenty cows in exchange for Chelsea Clinton's hand in marriage. Chepkurgor originally wrote to President Clinton offering the dowry of goats and cows during Clinton's 2000 visit to Kenya. According to Muliro Telewa, a reporter for the BBC, the number of animals offered in the dowry was very generous by Kenyan standards. Chepkurgor drew worldwide attention and headlines when he publicly disclosed his offer for her hand in marriage in 2005. He told The Standard in a 2005 interview that, \"Had I succeeded in wooing Chelsea, I would have had a grand wedding...I would have invited South African Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu to preside at the ceremony.\" His letter drew scrutiny from Kenyan authorities, who conducted background checks of his friends and family. He was summoned for a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which he declined to attend. On December 2, 2006, married his wife and college classmate, Grace Chepkurgor, at a ceremony held at the Kabarak University Chapel in Nakura. The couple had four children. In 2009, another Kenyan journalist brought up the subject of the 2000 marriage proposal to then U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a town hall meeting with reporters. After a pause, Secretary Clinton replied saying, \"My daughter is her own person. I will convey this very kind offer.\" Chepkurgor expressed happiness that his original marriage offer had been renewed in an interview with the BBC. Chepkurgor added at the time that his first wife, Grace, \"did not object\" to his proposal to Chelsea Clinton. Godwin Chepkurgor was killed in an elephant attack on August 1, 2014, while on assignment for the Kass Weekly magazine. Chepkurgor was in Ol-debes village, Mogotio, Baringo County, covering the story of a herd of African elephants which had been bothering local communities. He was taking pictures of the elephants when a male bull ambushed him from behind, trampled him and threw him in the air with his truck. Chepkurgor landed on some stick which caused abdominal injuries. Kenya Wildlife Service officers were finally able to drive the elephants away to rescue Chepkurgor. He was taken to Rift Valley General Hospital in Nakura where he died from his injuries at the age of 45. He was survived by his wife and four children."

For the most part, Grech was close to the policy action of the Howard and Rudd Governments, and had a reputation as being highly diligent and reliable. However, in Prime Minister and Cabinet he handled a controversial Western Bulldogs grant in 2004, and in the Department of the Treasury, he was in the middle of the 2009 OzCar affair, in which he forged an email to imply special treatment of Labor political donors. The OzCar affair forced his retirement from the public service in 2009."

  "text" : "George L. Little (1950 or 1951 – August 29, 2014) was an American costume designer. He was best known for his work on Kathryn Bigelow's acclaimed war films, The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, the latter of which earned him a nomination from the Costume Designers Guild Awards in the Excellence in Contemporary Film category. He was also nominated for an Emmy Award for his work on the 1988 miniseries Lincoln. Little got his start as a costumer on Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now and worked his way up to become a costume supervisor on such popular films as Airplane II: The Sequel, Red Dawn, About Last Night and No Way Out. He collaborated with Oscar-winning costume designer Albert Wolsky on numerous films, first as costume supervisor on Barry Levinson's Bugsy and Toys and Alan J. Pakula's The Pelican Brief and later as assistant costume designer on Striptease, Red Corner, Galaxy Quest, Lucky Numbers and Jarhead. Little's first film as head costume designer was Tony Scott's 1995 thriller Crimson Tide, which was followed by the 1999 family comedy The Prince and the Surfer, Rodrigo García's 2000 drama Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her and the 2001 television movie Uprising. In 2000, director John Moore enlisted Little to be head costume designer on his first feature film, the 2001 release Behind Enemy Lines. Little went on to design the costumes for Moore's next three films: Flight of the Phoenix, The Omen and Max Payne. Other films for which Little was costume designer include The Crazies, Warm Bodies, Transcendence and The Fantastic Four. In 1993, Little married fellow costume supervisor Carlane Passman, with whom he had worked on Bugsy, Toys, The Pelican Brief and Sliver. They continued working together during their marriage, with Passman serving as Little's assistant costume designer on The Prince and the Surfer, Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her, Behind Enemy Lines, Flight of the Phoenix and The Omen. Little and Passman divorced in 2014; later that year, on August 29, Little died at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 63. The details of his death were not disclosed."

His father did not want Giuseppe to become a comedian and in due course the young man became a pupil of the composer Giovanni Morandi, the husband of the singer Rosa Morandi. In the autumn of 1816 he married the soprano Giuseppina Ronzi de Begnis in Bologna and they were together until 1825. His countenance was seriously affected by smallpox, but he was skilled at applying make-up and on stage he gave no evidence of facial disfigurement. By 1815 he had established himself in a promising career which continued until the late 1820s in Italy, France and London and then in Northern Ireland from 1829 where he also ran an opera company. He continued to sing and manage opera companies in Scotland and from New York from 1838, where he lived until his death in 1849. He has been described as \"an ideal interpreter of Rossini's comic operas\"."

Rumpel worked in twelve different factories in Germany before coming to Canada in 1868, first settling in Hamilton, where he worked as a shoemaker for five years. In 1872, he married Minna Hartman. In 1875, he came to Berlin, where he worked at the Berlin Felt Boot Company. Rumpel bought the company in 1879. In 1903, he returned to Germany with his two sons to study advanced felt-making techniques. By the time he sold the company in 1909, it was employing 300 workers. He continued on as president until 1912 when he formed the Rumpel Felt Company. The family also owned the Berlin Asbestos Mine in northern Quebec. The felt factory continued to operate under family ownership until 2007. Rumpel served as chair of the Water Works Commission and was also a member of the Parks Board. He was also a member of the local Board of Trade. In 2013, Heritage Kitchener received a report recommending that the Rumpel Felt Building be designated as a heritage building by the city of Kitchener. The city plans to construct a central transit station in the area."

  "text" : "George Maddox (1760, Monmouth – 1843, London) was an architect, draughtsman, painter and teacher. Born the son of a builder, Maddox was apprenticed to his father and then worked in London as an assistant to John Soane, whom he assisted on several projects, including the Bank of England. Throughout his architectural career, Maddox exhibited drawings and paintings (watercolour over pencil). He exhibited four works (one in 1796, one in 1812, and two in 1819) at the Royal Academy. In 1790 the Duke of Cumberland, George III’s brother, commissioned him to build an opera house in Leicester Square. Maddox drew plans for the opera house, but the project was abandoned upon the death of the duke; the cancellation was a severe financial blow to Maddox. In 1824 Maddox was the architect for Strensham Court (which was destroyed by a fire in 1974). In 1824 Jeffrey Wyatville hired Maddox as his assistant in remodeling Windsor Castle. Also in 1824 Maddox was a founding member of the Society of British Artists and became a frequent exhibitor there. He was the architect for many private buildings and shops, built in the Anglo-Greek style, in the Strand, Conduit Street, Southampton Street, Tavistock Place and Bloomsbury. In old age, his architectural practice completely ceased, and he earned his living by teaching drawing and sometimes making designs and drawings for architects. His papers are in the archives of the Royal Institute of British Architects. His last residence was at Castle Street, Holborn. For many years Maddox at No. 7 Furnival's Inn taught drawing. On the first floor were two rooms for use by his students, his bedroom and his library of 5,000 volumes; on the second floor were his living rooms and a museum of ancient sculpture. Among his students were Cockerell, Decimus Burton, Hosking and several other eminent persons."

  "text" : "Graeme Butler is a heritage architect who has practiced in Melbourne, Australia for near to 40 years. He is principal of the heritage firm Graeme Butler & Associates, and author of many urban conservation and heritage studies and the authority on the Californian bungalow in Australia, which has been described as ...the quintessential work on the form. Butler studied architecture at the University of Melbourne being one of only three who graduated (1972) with a major in history. This was one result of the Architecture School's broader curriculum, emanating in part from the student strikes at Melbourne University in the 1960s. After graduating he worked as a design assistant at Yuncken Freeman Architects (YFA)on the interior fit-out of the Austin Hospital ward block under the eccentric but brilliant Tony Woodhouse, eventually taking a lead design role on the completion of the Toorak Teachers College library and theatre building under YFA partner Roy Simpson. This building was in the YFA office style as shown by their own superb offices at 411 King Street, Melbourne and BHP house, only white in place of the standard matte black. Simpson said he wanted some `magic' in the new building - so the designer tried for some internal 2 storey spaces and floating stairs, following the firm's preferred Ludwig Mies van der Rohe model. Butler then worked with McIntyre & McIntyre, on the pioneering recycling of the Henry Jones Jam Factory at Chapel street, Prahran, as a shopping centre cinema. However his major architectural role was as the project designer of the Museum Underground Railway Station fit-out and MURLA graphics documentation, with Perrott Lyon Timlock & Kesa, under associate David Simpson. The design of the Victorian Teachers Union offices in Camberwell was his last major architectural work before taking a professional role in his growing interest in urban conservation. Before forming his own heritage consulting practice and still working for the architecture and planning firm Perrott Lyon Mathieson, Butler completed one of the first heritage studies of the Melbourne Central Business District, undertaken for the newly created Historic Buildings Preservation Council, in the mid 1970s. He has undertaken numerous other heritage studies in Victoria including many Melbourne suburbs as well as Geelong, Bendigo, and the Macedon Ranges. He has been described as one of ...Australia’s most significant practitioners and researchers in heritage and conservation. He was the founding Secretary of the Council for the Historic Environment and later editor of the Council Journal Historic Environment, which launched in 1980."

  "text" : "Ghwarath ibn al-Harith also known as Du'thar ibn al-Harith was a companion (Sahaba) of Muhammad. He was the first person to try and assassinate Muhammad during the Invasion of Dhi Amr. According to Muslim scholar Sami Strauch, it is reported in Sahih Bukhari that it was raining, and Muhammad took his garments off and hung it on a tree to dry, while the enemy was watching, Ghwarath ibn al-Harith went to attack Muhammad. He threatened Muhammad with his sword and said \"who will protect you from me on this day\". Then according to Muslim Scholars the Angel Gabriel came and thumped Ghawrath in the chest and forced him to drop his sword. Muhammad then picked up the sword and said \"who will protect you from me\". Sahih al Bukhari mentions this incident:"

After her retirement, she received the Fulbright Scholarship to teach Women’s College of Ein Shams University in Cairo, Egypt. She was selected as a fellow for the American Institute of Nutrition (1946), as well as the Society of Biological Chemists and the American Chemical Society. She also garnered a few awards for her accomplishments, including the Alumni Achievement Award from Carleton College, the Borden Award of the American Home Economics Association (1942) and the Borden Award of the American Institute of Nutrition (1946)."

  "text" : "Gary McLarty (January 16, 1941 – October 11, 2014) was an American stunt performer and stunt coordinator for film and television. His abilities earned him the nickname \"Whiz Kid\" in Hollywood. McLarty performed stunts in over 150 films between 1966 and 2004, among them The Wild Bunch, Little Big Man, The Longest Yard, Blade Runner, The Terminator, Jurassic Park, Heat, and Collateral. He also performed in numerous John Wayne films, including The War Wagon, The Undefeated, Chisum, McQ, and Rooster Cogburn. In addition, he was the stunt coordinator on such films as Animal House, The Blues Brothers, Beverly Hills Cop, Beverly Hills Cop II and Days of Thunder. On Animal House, it was McLarty who, doubling as the character of \"D-Day,\" rode the motorcycle up the fraternity house stairs. He also doubled as Henry Winkler's Fonzie for that character's motorcycle scenes on the sitcom Happy Days. In 1982, McLarty was hired to serve as stunt coordinator on Twilight Zone: The Movie, on which he also doubled for actor Vic Morrow. On July 23, McLarty was one of six people on board a Bell UH-1 Iroquois being used during the filming of a scene for Twilight Zone when the helicopter spun out of control and crashed, killing Morrow and two children on the ground and injuring McLarty and the others aboard the helicopter. In the subsequent trial, McLarty testified that, prior to the accident, he had warned director John Landis that the stunt was too dangerous. McLarty semi-retired from stunt work in 2004. The following year, he testified at the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, testifying that Blake offered him $10,000 to murder Blake's wife, Bonnie Lee Bakley; McLarty declined. Bakley was fatally shot in Blake's car outside a restaurant in May 2001. On October 11, 2014, McLarty and his friend and fellow stuntman, Bob Orrison, were killed in a traffic collision in Rancho Cordova, California. McLarty was 73."

  "text" : "Dr. George Cabell Sr. was born in Buckingham County, Virginia and attended Hampden-Sydney Academy. He became the first to earn an official medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1790. Dr. Cabell was a friend and personal physician to the patriot Patrick Henry and a frequent correspondent with his neighbor, Thomas Jefferson. By 1798 Dr. George Cabell was practicing in Lynchburg, and that year married Sarah Winston (1770–1826), the eldest daughter of Judge Edmund Winston and Alice Taylor Winston. She was a lady of \"great elegance, beauty and refinement\". The Winston family was well-connected in their own right, and the marriage created a very powerful union. One year later George was the attending physician at the death of his patriot friend. Patrick Henry's son Alexander Spotswood Henry would later marry George's daughter Paulina Cabell. Alexander was named after his great uncle Alexander Spotswood, a Lieutenant-Colonel in the British Army and Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. Spotswood was a leader in Virginia and American history for a number of his projects as Governor, including his exploring beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains, his establishing what was perhaps the first colonial iron works, and his negotiating the Treaty of Albany with the Iroquois Nations of New York. George was the son of Col. John Cabell, who was the son of William Cabell the immigrant. From the time the immigrant William came ashore in 1726, the Cabells established a family tradition of medical care which continued into the nineteenth century when the practice of medicine became highly regulated, and formal training a prerequisite. William Cabell, who may not have had any formal training before arriving, more than made up for it by purchasing dozens of medical books. He embraced a \"no cure, no fee\" policy, in which he charged only those patients who recovered. George also mentored his cousin, Dr. George Cabell, Jr., who later took his own degree from Philadelphia. The tradition continued with Cabell, Jr.'s son, Dr. James Lawrence Cabell, who became a Professor of Comparative Anatomy, Physiology, and Surgery at the University of Virginia and the president of the short-lived National Board of Health, 1876-1883. In 1806 Dr. Cabell and his wife began construction of a mansion on a sprawling 737 acre plantation in Lynchburg. Finished in 1816, the grand estate would depict a colorful history in the Lynchburg annals and later be named Point of Honor to reflect stories of it being an alleged location for settling arguments with duels. George died in Lynchburg in 1823 as a result of a fall from his horse. There he would be laid to rest. His wife Sarah died in Lynchburg in 1826. Famous relatives include Col. William J. Lewis and John Cabell Breckinridge, 14th Vice President of the U.S. under James Buchanan. The home is now a museum and open to the public."

He is noted for his groundbreaking work \"Die spätrömische Kupferprägung\", Late Roman Copper Coinage, which provides a key to coins of the late Roman period through its analysis of the iconography present on the Obverse and reverse, allowing an identification even in the case of worn mintmarks. This work has served as a basis for other studies and is frequently cited as a resource for the identification of worn late Roman coins. It was re-edited and translated into English in 2014, under the title \"Late Roman Bronze Coinage – An attribution guide for poorly preserved coins\"."

  "text" : "George John Godolphin Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford (born 28 July 1992), styled as the Earl of Sunderland until 2014, is an English aristocrat. He is the heir apparent to the Dukedom of Marlborough. He is the son of Jamie Spencer-Churchill, 12th Duke of Marlborough and his first wife, Rebecca Mary Few Brown. Lord Blandford is a distant relative of the conservative wartime prime minister Sir Winston Churchill (first cousin of his great-great-grandfather) and of Diana, Princess of Wales (his 4th cousin once removed). He is also a descendant of Consuelo Vanderbilt. As his father has had a chequered past, including serving time in prison for forging prescriptions and road rage, Lord Blandford was announced as the financial beneficiary of his grandfather's estate. His inheritance includes Blenheim Palace, a 187-room mansion set on 2,000 acres in Oxfordshire. Lord Blandford was educated at Harrow School, where he was captain of the school polo team. He subsequently studied urbanisation at University College London."

  "text" : "George Andrews Moriarty, Jr. (1883–1968), called G. Andrews Moriarty in most of his published work, was an American genealogist from Newport, Rhode Island. He was born in Newport on February 14, 1883, the only son of George Andrews Moriarty and Mary Ann Sheffield. His ancestor, John Moriarty, emigrated from Ireland in 1777 and settled in Salem, Massachusetts. George attended St. George's School in Newport, and then did his undergraduate work at Harvard University where he earned an A.B. in 1905, cum laude. He then attended Christ Church College in Oxford, England where he specialized in historical studies, following which he returned to Harvard to earn an M.A. in 1907. Moriarty went to work for the U. S. State Department in the foreign service, and served in consular and secretarial roles in Fiume, Italy; Mexico City; and Guatemala. He returned to Harvard once again to study law, and received his LL.B. in 1916. He practiced law in Providence, Rhode Island and Boston, Massachusetts for over a decade, which time also included a year in the U.S. Army at the end of World War I when he was a captain in military intelligence. In 1927 he ended his career in law and devoted the remainder of his life to historical and genealogical pursuits. Moriarty's interest in genealogy began when he was young, and in 1899, at the age of 16, he became a member of the New England Historic Genealogical Society. In 1912 he became a member of the society's Council, in 1916 was named the Corresponding Secretary and in 1918 became chairman of the Committee on English and Foreign Research. He also served as the chairman for publications for 25 years and was on the Committee for Heraldry from 1920 to 1949. Making his first contribution to the New England Historical and Genealogical Register in 1912, Moriarty submitted 134 articles to that journal over the next 54 years, most of them dealing with English feudal families. In addition, he became a contributing editor of The American Genealogist, published by Donald Lines Jacobus, and from 1932 to 1965 submitted more than 75 articles to this journal. These articles included a series of additions and corrections to John Osborne Austin's Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island. He also contributed to more than a dozen other American and English journals, as well as writing genealogical notes in the Boston Evening Transcript for a period of 30 years. Moriarty was a fellow of the American Society of Genealogists and of the Society of Genealogists, London and the Society of Antiquaries, London. He was also the founder and first president of the Descendants of the Illegitimate Sons and Daughters of the Kings of Britain. In his personal life, Moriarty was twice married. He was first married in London in 1908 to Olga Gillming of Budapest, Hungary; they were divorced three years later. He was married a second time in 1930 to the Countess Louise de Alfau, the daughter of John V. Dittemore of New York. She died in the summer of 1968, and Moriarty died less than two weeks later, on 12 July 1968, at the York Harbor Nursing Home in York Harbor, Maine. In 1986 the National Genealogical Society instituted a Hall of Fame for individuals that had made significant strides in the field of genealogy. In 1990 G. Andrews Moriarty was inducted into that prestigious group, having been nominated by the Genealogical Society of Utah and the American Society of Genealogists."

  "text" : "George Tait St Aubyn Nixon (11 August 1850 – February 1913) was an Indian-born English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Middlesex, Cambridge University and a side representing the \"Gentlemen of the South\". He was born at Neermuck in the Rajputana, India and died at Lintlaw, Saskatchewan, Canada. The precise date of his death is not known. Nixon was educated at Rossall School and matriculated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1869; there is no evidence that he read for a degree at Cambridge University and from 1870 to 1897 he is recorded as being employed by the public works department of the Indian Civil Service in Bengal. As a cricketer, Nixon was a right-handed batsman; he also kept wicket in some games and was a round-arm slow bowler, though he did not bowl in first-class matches. He made his first-class debut as a batsman for Middlesex in 1868 and the following year, again playing only as a batsman, he scored 54, his only innings of note, in a match against Surrey. At Cambridge in 1870, he was tried as a wicketkeeper in a single match against the Marylebone Cricket Club but made only one stumping; a week later, he was recalled to the Cambridge side during the match against the Gentlemen of England as a replacement for an ill player and, allowed to keep wicket, made four stumpings and took two catches. He did not play for Cambridge University again and a single further appearance for Middlesex and one for a Gentlemen of the South side, both also in the 1870 season, were his final matches in first-class cricket."

For their initial web project and collaborative video blog, see VlogBrothers. Not to be confused with the Brothers Green or Green Brothers Novelty Band. The Green brothers, John (born August 24, 1977) and Hank (born May 5, 1980), are two American brothers, entrepreneurs, social activists, and YouTube vloggers. The two extensively work with each other in their lives and careers, having started their collaborative popularity with their \"Brotherhood 2.0\" project in 2007. The Greens' portfolio of online work, which Hank describes as \"a small YouTube network with about 15 channels,\" includes their main \"VlogBrothers\" channel, SciShow, and The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, among several others. John has risen from being a popular YouTube personality to Hollywood stardom with his breakthrough novel, The Fault in Our Stars, and its 2014 film adaptation. Although the novel's positioning at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list, as well as the box office success of the film are reasons for his rise to celebrity prominence, John maintains he is instead best known for his online projects, such as Crash Course. Hank has also made himself individually known, having created \"EcoGeek\", a blog dedicated to environmentally beneficial advancements in technology. The blog was originally a class project of Hank's, while he studied at the University of Montana, but eventually progressed into becoming a major environmental publication, which would grab the attention of Time. Hank has also gained recognition for co-founding the record label DFTBA Records with Alan Lastufka. Together, however, the two brothers are credited with creating as some have described as, a \"YouTube media,\" or \"online multimedia\" empire. This empire, including projects centered on education, gaming, and trivia, among others, has amassed an active fanbase known as \"Nerdfighteria.\""

This placed him among the country's first top international sportsmen, following its independence in 1944. He remains the only Icelandic athlete to win two European athletics titles. He won eighteen Icelandic national titles in total: ten in shot put, six in discus throw and two in hammer throw. His personal best marks of 16.74 m (54 ft 11 in) for the shot put and 50.13 m (164 ft 5 1⁄2 in) for the discus were Icelandic records. Despite his national success, he also caused controversy in Iceland due to his alcoholism and a physical assault, for which he served a jail sentence. As a result, he was banned from competition for a period by the national governing body."
