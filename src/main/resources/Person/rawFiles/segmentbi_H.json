He was the second of four sons of Susan Clarke Warren and Samuel Dennis Warren, a wealthy paper manufacturer in Boston, who died in 1888. He graduated in 1879 with an A.B. from Harvard University, and followed it up with studies at Johns Hopkins University under Lanman and Maurice Bloomfield, and at Oxford University with T. W. Rhys Davids. He purchased the house of Charles Beck in 1891, and lived in it until his death in 1899 at which he bequeathed it, along with the bulk of his estate, to Harvard University; the building is now known as the Beck-Warren House (or Warren House). His work Buddhism in Translation (1896) and translation (along with Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi) of the Visuddhimagga of Buddhaghosa (1950) respectively appeared as Volume 3 and Volume 41 of the Harvard Oriental Series."

  "text" : "Hanne Tott or Tod, also called Price and Kuhn (14 February 1771 - August 15,1826), was a Danish circus artist and circus manager. She and her family played an important part in the history of the circus in Scandinavia. She should not be confused with her sister-in-law Rosalia Price, also called Madame Price. She was born to Stephen and Hanne Todd and married in 1791 to the British circus manager James Price (1761-1805). She and her spouse toured Scandinavia, Denmark, Sweden and Norway with their circus. In 1793-94, they performed at Stenborg Theatre in Stockholm. From 1795, they regularly performed in Copenhagen during the summer and toured Denmark and Norway during the winter. They were permitted to found a permanent stage in Copenhagen in 1801. She became manager after the death of her spouse in 1805. In 1810, she married Frantz Joseph Kuhn (1783-1832), with whom she shared her position as manager."

Kratzert's family settled in the Soviet-occupied territory that became East Germany, where he grew up. After military service, Kratzert began working at DEFA the state-owned East German film company. After making his directoral debut in 1968, Kratzert went on to direct a further thirteen films up to 1989. He made a number of family films and in 1972 directed the Red Western Tecumseh (1972), a biopic of the Native American leader of the same name. The Fall of the Berlin Wall and the closure of DEFA effectively ended his career as a film director."

  "text" : "Howard Reynold Penn OBE (1903–1994), more commonly known simply as H.R. Penn, was a politician who served during the years immediately after the reintroduction of democracy in the British Virgin Islands in 1950. He was elected as a member of First Legislative Council and continued to serve until his defeat in the 1963 general election. Prior to the introduction of Ministerial government in 1967, various executive type posts were delegated to members of the Legislative Council in a ministerial-like fashion. From 1957 to H.R. Penn was appointed Member for Trade and Production, and he was reappointed to that post from 1960-1963. H.R. Penn later served as the Speaker of the House from 1971-1975 under Willard Wheatley's administration. Record keeping during the early years of politics in the British Virgin Islands was poor; electoral records are incomplete, and there were no newspapers published in the Territory at the time (the first newspaper in the British Virgin Islands, The Island Sun, was first published in 1962). Much of the information on politics from the early days come from H.R. Penn's memoirs."

  "text" : "Hugh Armstrong Clegg (22 May 1920 – 9 December 1995) was a British academic who was a founder of the \"National Board for Prices and Incomes\" (1965–71) and later presided over the \"Standing Commission on Pay Comparability\" set up by James Callaghan in 1979. Clegg was born in Truro. Educated at the Methodist Kingswood School, he rebelled by becoming a Communist for a period in his youth, but gained a scholarship to study Classics at Magdalen College, Oxford University; he then served for five years in the army during the Second World War. After returning to Oxford, where he gained a first class degree in PPE in 1947, he was persuaded by G. D. H. Cole to take up the study of industrial relations. He became a fellow of Nuffield College in 1949. In 1965 he was appointed to the \"Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations\" (also known as the \"Donovan Commission\") set up by the Labour government under Harold Wilson to seek solutions to the problem of strikes which plagued the British economy of the period. Clegg successfully argued in the Commission that strikes were caused by poor industrial management, not by unions, effectively derailing Barbara Castle's White Paper, In Place of Strife, which sought to establish legislative intervention in major disputes, and which the Commission had originally supported. He also became a member of the \"National Board for Prices and Incomes\" set up in 1965 to regulate a prices and incomes policy, but the intractable circumstances of labour relations in Britain meant that this initiative remained a \"damp squib\". The Board was wound down in 1971 and Clegg wrote a book on his experience entitled How to Run an Incomes Policy, and Why We Made Such a Mess of the Last One. From 1967 to 1979 Clegg was Professor of Industrial Relations at Warwick University (the first to hold this appointment), and took part in the launch of Warwick Business School, where he founded the Industrial Relations Research Unit in 1970. In 1979 James Callaghan requested Clegg to chair the \"Standing Commission on Pay Comparability\" with which it was hoped to tackle the public service disputes of the sort which had led to the 'Winter of Discontent' of 1978–9. The Commission was disbanded by the incoming government of Margaret Thatcher, who blamed it for over-inflating the government wage bill. Clegg wrote numerous studies, including a three volume History of British Trade Unions (published between 1964 and 1994). His book The System of Industrial Relations in Great Britain (1953, revised 1970 and 1979) was regarded as a major text on the topic. He died in Warwick in 1995 of a stroke."

His public sculpture can be seen throughout cities in Germany, and also in Chicago. Hahn was born in 1868 in Veilsdorf. His parents, Adalbert and Ida Hahn, were both involved in the porcelain industry. The Hahns moved to Rudolstadt where Hermann was meant to attend Gymnasium, but he left school in order to study drawing under the Hofmaler Rudolf Oppenheim. He then trained in sculpting wood and in 1887 began his studies in Munich, at the Kunstgewerbeschule and the Akademie der Bildenden Künste. He formed deep ties to Munich and the Akademie, eventually becoming a professor himself and teaching there for decades. Hahn traveled abroad throughout Europe and was especially influenced by the sculpture of antiquity. He is known for his monumental sculpture in a neoclassical style. He created allegorical figures such as the reclining form of a hunter representing Bavaria at the Luitpoldbrücke (1901) and the Rosselenker in front of the Technische Hochschule in Munich (1928), as well as portraits and memorials of historical figures, such as the Goethe monument in Chicago (1913), the Liszt monument in Weimar (1902), and the Luther monument in Speyer (1904)."

  "text" : "Hans Hinrich (1903–1974) was a German actor and film director. As well as Germany, he also worked in Italy where he was usually credited as Giovanni Hinrich. Hinrich was a noted theatre director, before moving into film direction in 1932. Hinrich was of Jewish heritage, although he converted to Catholicism. While he was initially granted permisision to continue working following the Nazi takeover of Germany, he found it increasingly difficult and moved to Italy following the production of Freight from Baltimore (1938). During the Fascist era he made several films such as the historical Lucrezia Borgia (1940). When Hinrich was threatened with dismissal from the 1941 film Il vetturale del San Gottardo, several of his actors including Osvaldo Valenti secured a reversal of the decision by protesting their support for him. After the war he switched to acting, making his screen debut in the 1946 neorealist film Before Him All Rome Trembled and also appearing in Les Misérables (1948). He later returned to his native Germany."

  "text" : "Henry Deane Grady (1764-1847), was an MP for Limerick City in both the Parliament of Ireland and the Parliament of the United Kingdom. He was born in Limerick in about 1764, the son of Standish Grady and Frances Deane. He began his career as a barrister in 1787. He married Dorcas Spread of Ballycannon, County Cork in 1794; they had three sons and five daughters. Grady's daughter Amelia married Edward Chichester, 4th Marquess of Donegall. Grady was a member of the Royal Dublin Society, and a noted duelist. He was elected to the Irish parliament for Limerick City in 1797. Despite the potential political cost to himself, Grady supported the Union with Great Britain. In 1799, he wrote, \"I suffer much in my expectations because, if I pursue my profession, I must remain in this country, and it is idle to say that an individual here, however industrious or intelligent as a barrister, unknown to the British minister in the Imperial Parliament, can expect that situation of which, as a member of the Irish parliament, time, zeal and fitness for judicial situation acquired at least through practice, might induce a reasonable hope....\" In the general election of 1801, Grady was elected to the new Limerick City constituency in the UK Parliament. He appeared at Westminster in November 1801. He did not seek re-election. For his support of the Union, Dublin Castle appointed him second counsel to the revenue board, with an annual salary of £1,200. Disappointed in not having been better remunerated for his Unionism, Grady supported opposition candidates in the general elections of 1812 and 1818. He died 8 September 1847."

  "text" : "Harry S. McAlpin (July 21, 1906 - July 18, 1985) was the first African-American reporter to attend a U.S. Presidential news conference in 1944. Born on July 21, 1906, in St. Louis, Missouri, Harry McAlpin studied journalism and advertising at the University of Wisconsin. After graduating in 1926, he moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked as a reporter, editor, and office manager for the Washington Tribune, an African American weekly paper, from 1926 to 1929. He then handled publicity and advertising for the National Benefit Life Insurance Company from 1929 to 1933. When the New Deal got underway in 1933, McAlpin joined the New Negro Alliance to “protect employment of Negroes under the NRA [National Recovery Administration] program.”  He served in the Federal Security Agency and the U.S. Employment Service while attending the Robert H. Terrell Law School at night. He passed the D.C. bar examination in 1937. McAlpin became an assistant to Mary McLeod Bethune, Director of Negro Affairs at the National Youth Administration. On the side, he worked as a part-time Washington correspondent for the Chicago Defender. In 1943 the National Negro Publishers Association (NNPA) petitioned the White House Correspondents Association (WHCA) for press credentials on the grounds that the Atlanta Daily World was one of its member papers. All other African American papers at the time were weeklies, and the press credentials were limited to reporters for daily papers. The WHCA agreed but it took several more months before the NNPA could afford to open its own Washington bureau and hire McAlpin as its full-time Washington correspondent. In February 1944 he attended his first presidential press conference and was greeted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who shook his hand and said, “I’m glad to see you, McAlpin, and very happy to have you here.” Although accredited at the White House, McAlpin was rejected when he applied for a congressional press pass. The Standing Committee of Correspondents that controlled accreditation for the newspaper press galleries at the Capitol regarded him as a reporter for mostly weekly papers, while the Periodical Press gallery rejected him because he reported for newspapers rather than magazines. McAlpin believed that these actions were influenced “by my racial identity rather than the flimsy technicality publicly stated.” Strong competition from a rival news service, the Associated Negro Press (ANP), led the NNPA to replace McAlpin as its Washington Correspondent with Louis Lautier. McAlpin moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where he served as the only African American assistant commonwealth attorney until 1953, when he resigned after being dropped from a criminal prosecution of three white women. McAlpin became head of the Louisville chapter of the NAACP. He died on July 18, 1985. He was posthumously honored by the White House Correspondents Association at their May 3, 2014 dinner. The WHCA created a scholarship in his memory, and President Barack Obama noted his pioneering journalism."

He has been a leading figure in the field of social psychology, credited with helping to launch the study of relationship science and notable for his contribution to theories of intimacy. His research encompasses emotional regulation, the factors that influence social interaction, and consequences of different socializing patters for health and psychological well-being. Reis received a B.S. from City College of New York in 1970 and a Ph.D. from New York University in 1975. He has served as president of the International Society for the Study of Personal Relationships and chair of the American Psychological Association's Board of Scientific Affairs, as well as executive officer and later, president of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. In 2012, Reis was selected for the Distinguished Career Award from the International Association for Relationship Research. He was also the recipient of the 2009 Goergen Award for Distinguished Achievement and Artistry in Undergraduate Teaching. Among his other accomplishments, Reis was an editor for the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes) and later Current Directions in Psychological Science. In particular, Reis investigates psychological processes that affect interpersonal relationships, intimacy, and attachment. His studies address gender and sex factors, dating variables, perspectives on partner responsiveness, principles of familiarity, and perceptions of similarity and dissimilarity. Much of his research is informed by his subjects’ detailed, daily records of social activity. His research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Israel Science Foundation, and the Fetzer Institute. He was a Fulbright Senior Research Scholar in 1991."

Her mother's death in 1806 led to an unpleasant situation in which her father's long-time mistress Lady Elizabeth Foster took control of the Devonshire household; as the unmarried eldest daughter, this should have been Harriet's role. To help her escape this awkward domestic situation, Harriet's maternal aunt Henrietta arranged for her niece to marry her lover of seventeen years, Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville. The couple's marriage proved to be happy, and it produced five children. Granville served as his country's ambassador to France intermittently from 1824 to 1841, and he was awarded an earldom in 1833. With her position, Harriet acted as hostess to Parisian society, writing detailed accounts that were later published. She died in 1862 of a stroke, having been widowed fifteen years."

  "text" : "Howell Gwynne (16 April 1718 – 1780) was a British politician. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Radnorshire from 1755 to 1761, and Old Sarum 1761 to 1768. Educated at Christ Church, Oxford,Howell stood unsuccessfully at the 1754 general election as candidate for Breconshire. The following year he was chosen by chosen by the agents of the Duke of Newcastle as their candidate for the Radnorshire seat which had been vacated by Sir Humphrey Howorth. He was elected unopposed, and his expenses £173 were paid out of secret service money. His subsequent appointment as Lord Lieutenant of Radnorshire offended Lord Carnarvon, and a deal was eventually reached whereby Gwynne would remain Lord Lieutenant for five years, and at the next election abandon Radnorshire in favour of a seat in the rotten borough of Old Sarum. Carnarvon took the Radnorshire seat, and Gwynne was duly returned for Old Sarum at the 1761 general election, and held it until 1768. Described as \"dim\", he not recorded as having ever spoken in the House of Commons. By 1765 he was canvassing again in Radnorshire. However, Chase Price then entered the race and won such support that Gwynne did not contest the 1768 general election."

Heydon made national news in the UK in 2009 when a secret recording he made of Conservative politician Alan Duncan in the Houses of Parliament resulted in Duncan's dismissal. As a schoolboy he played Colin Craven in the 1993 film The Secret Garden. For the United Kingdom general election, 2015, Prowse changed his name to Michael Green via deed poll in order to stand as an independent candidate against Grant Shapps in the Welwyn Hatfield constituency. The name Michael Green is a pseudonym of Shapps which has attracted controversy. He secured 216 votes in the election, placing sixth out of seven candidates. Prowse also acted as the presenter for the BBC documentary show The Town That Took on the Taxman shown in January 2016, where businesses in the small Welsh town Crickhowell attempted to minimise their tax burden using the same ways as large corporations."

He was called to the Bar and became King's Serjeant in December 1471: the appointment, unusually, was stated to be for life. In fact he apparently held it only until December 1476. In the latter year he became Controller of the Ports of Dublin and Drogheda. He was briefly Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1478–80 and was then demoted to the post of an ordinary justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). LIke all his judicial colleagues in Ireland he backed the unsuccessful attempt by the pretender Lambert Simnel to seize the English throne in 1487, an attempt which was crushed decisively at the Battle of Stoke Field. He took part in a public ceremony of repentance the following year and received a royal pardon from the victorious King Henry VII."

  "text" : "Harry Koundakjian (July 11, 1930 – April 21, 2014) was a Syrian-born American news photographer, photojournalist and photo editor. He joined the Associated Press, first as a freelance photographer in 1960s, and then as a full-time staffer beginning in 1969. Koundakjian, who worked for the AP out of the Middle East and New York City, covered the Lebanese Civil War, the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, and the 1978 wedding of King Hussein of Jordan to Queen Noor. He worked as a photo editor at the AP office in New York City until his retirement in 2006. Harry was so moved by events at 9/11 that he put together a special collection of photographs to record this memorable attack on New York - lest we forget. Koundakjian was born in Syria, but completed high school in neighboring Lebanon. He and his family moved from the Middle East to New York City in 1979. He worked as a photo editor for the Associated Press until his retirement from the wire service in 2006. Harry Koundakjian died from complications of open heart surgery at a hospital in Manhattan, New York City, on April 21, 2014, at the age of 83. He was survived by his wife, daughter and son. In September 2015, Harry's nephew Dr Sam Allen, who was present at 9/11 Ground Zero in 2001 as an emergency medic wrote a book about his exploits working for 9 days near the scene and used a special collection of iconic photographs taken and compiled by Harry as reminder that we should never forget. The images were sent to Sam before Harry died with a request from him to pass on so that we never forget the day that changed our lives. The book is now available to commemorate the 14th anniversary of this national tragedy."

The new firm was known as Hoppin, Read & Hoppin. They worked together until 1896, when Francis left to found the firm of Hoppin & Koen in New York City. It was at this time that Hoppin took Edward F. Ely (1858-1920) into the firm, as Hoppin & Ely. In 1907, Ely left to become a member of the city's Board of Park Commissioners. At this point, Frederick E. Field became partner. This arrangement lasted until 1922, when Thomas J. Hill Peirce, joined, the firm becoming Hoppin, Field & Peirce. It was dissolved within a few years, at which point Hoppin appears to have retired."

He was jailed in Syria for 23 years after Hafez al-Assad took over power in a coup d'état. Fayez moved to Damascus, Syria and lived there for several years. He was arrested after the coup d'état by Hafez al-Assad in November 1970. At the time of his arrest he was member of the National Command of the Ba'ath Party and considered a supporter of Salah Jadid. He then spent over twenty years in Mezzeh prison, being released in 1993. Fayez then returned to Jordan. After the bombing of Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom in 1998 Fayez headed the Jordanian National Mobilisation Committee for the Defense of Iraq (NMCDI) after the previous head, Sulayman Arar, died. The NMCDI sought support amongst Arabs to cease the existing embargo against Iraq. It further sponsored peaceful protests, conferences and visiting speakers. Fayez wished to stand candidate in the 2003 elections for the House of Representatives. However, his candidateship was rejected by the Central Elections Committee on the grounds that he did not stand candidate in the right district. As a Bedouin from the Central Badia District he needed to compete there, in line with the quota. Fayez appealed the decision, saying he was a Jordanian citizen with the right to compete in any district he wanted. He also found the quota to be degrading. He had four children, two sons and two daughters. His daughter Hind al-Fayez was elected to the House of Representatives for the Central Badia district Women's Quota in the 2013 elections."

  "text" : "Hermann of Cilli (1383–13 December 1421), also known as Armand de Cilli, or Herniosus mit dem Bruche (\"Herniosus with the rupture\"), was born in Cilli, the illegitimate son, although later legitimated, of Count Hermann II of Celje, of the family of the Counts of Cilli and Sanneck, whose family seat was in Celje Castle (Burg Obercilli, now in Slovenia). King Sigismund was betrothed in 1409 to Barbara of Cilli, the youngest daughter of Count Hermann II, who had saved the king's life at the Battle of Nikopolis. The Count became one of Sigismund's most powerful advisers, and it was easy for him to obtain the bishopric of Freising for his son Hermann when it suddenly fell vacant. At this time Hermann was studying in Bologna, when on 26 July 1412 Pope John XXII, on the intervention of the German emperor Sigismund, named him Bishop of Freising. As he was still too young to be consecrated a bishop, he received a papal dispensation allowing him to rule in Freising. He had to borrow 10,000 Gulden from his father to pay the annates due to the papacy. On 8 September 1413 he was anointed bishop.The cathedral chapter of Freising was entirely taken by surprise by the sudden death of Bishop Konrad von Hebenstreit and the equally sudden nomination of Hermann, which prevented it from exercising its right of election. From 1414 to 1418 Hermann took part in the Council of Constance, where he represented the interests of king Sigismund. In the summer of 1419 he agreed an alliance with the bishops of the ecclesiastical province of Salzburg, under the leadership of the Archbishop, for the protection of their spiritual Immunitätsrechte with the promise of mutual support against the territorial princes. Because of their good relations with the king the family was able to persuade Pope Martin V to transfer him to the seat of the Prince-Bishop of Trent, vacant since the banishment of George of Lichtenstein in August 1419. The Papal nomination took place on 29 March 1421, but Martin V was oblige to rescind it on 13 September 1421, as the cathedral chapter of Trent were not willing to accept Hermann, because of his severe rupture. In order to regain Trent he returned to Cilli in late autumn and underwent an operation, which he did not survive. He died on 13 December 1421 and was buried in the parish church of Celje, now Celje Cathedral. His monument is in the presbytery, on the Gospel side."

  "text" : "Henry G. Munson (1909–1975) was an officer in the United States Navy during the Second World War and Korean War. He served with distinction during wartime and played a critical role in the development of submarine warfare. Munson enlisted in the Navy in 1927. He was accepted into the US Naval Academy the next year, from where he graduated in 1932. He served on surface ships until entering submarine school in 1936. During World War II, Munson commanded several submarines, including the USS Crevalle (SS-291), the USS S-38 (SS-143), and the USS Rasher (SS-269). In the course of a single day under his command, the lattermost submarine sank Japanese ships totaling an estimated 55,723 tons. The cruise sank the tenth most enemy ships of any submarine mission in the war. Following the war, he became a leader in submarine warfare research and development. According to Naval documents, in November, 1946, \"he supervised the first actual guided missile firings from submarines\" as the commander of Submarine Division 71. He headed the group that developed the Mark 45 torpedo, planned and oversaw Operation Sandblast, the first submerged circumnavigation of the world, and directed the investigation into the loss of the USS Thresher (SSN-593). In addition to the Navy Cross with two Gold Stars in lieu of additional awards, the Commendation Ribbon with two stars and Combat \"V,\" the Presidential Unit Citation Ribbon and the Navy Commendation Ribbon, Captain Munson has the American Defense Service Medal with star; Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with two operation stars; American Campaign Medal; World War II Victory Medal China Service Medal (extended); National Defense Service Medal; Korean Service Medal; and United Nations Service Medal. Captain Munson married the former Anna M. Olsen of Waukegan, Illinois in Honolulu in 1939. Munson retired from the Navy in 1959, after which he served as senior research associate for the David Sarnoff Research Center. A third and last career found him teaching advanced physics at Princeton High School. Following his death on July 16, 1975, Captain Munson and Anna’s remains were interned in the Pacific Ocean west of Kauai on February 6th, 2002.[4]"

A founding member of the Free Foresters Cricket Club, he played there between 1858 and 1872, and also played for Herefordshire and Cheshire. A round-arm bowler of unknown handedness and often a wicketkeeper, he was born in Holmes Chapel in Cheshire, and died in Llandegfan, Anglesey, Wales. Armistead was a member of a cricketing family: his brother William played first class cricket, while brothers John and Robert, and nephew William, all played school cricket. While schooling at Charterhouse he played cricket for three years, captaining the senior team, in 1855. Fred Lillywhite remarked of him that \"His thorough knowledge of the game enabled him to fill most ably the office of captain. His batting throughout the season was excellent. His style is good, and he possesses great freedom in hitting all round. His bowling throughout the season was well up to the mark. Perhaps a little more steadiness in his batting would improve his scores.\""

  "text" : "Herman Stsepanovich Kantoyeu (Belarusian: Герман Сцяпанавіч Кантоеў; born November 27, 1971 in Khabarovsk, Russian SFSR) is a retired amateur Belarusian freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's featherweight category. Considered as one of the world's top freestyle wrestlers in his decade, Kantoyeu became a freestyle wrestling champion in the 54-kg division at the 2001 World Wrestling Championships, and later represented his nation Belarus in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Kantoyeu was also a member of the Belarusian national wrestling team since the breakup of the Soviet Union, under his personal coach Valentin Murzinkov. Kantoyeu made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's bantamweight category (54 kg). He pinned Cuba's Wilfredo García on his opening bout, but could not beat Kyrgyzstan's Nurbin Donbaev with a score 2–5 in the prelim pool. Despite a single loss, Kantoyeu still managed to secure a spot for the quarterfinals because of the most number of points collected from the elimination round. Followed by the next morning's session, Kantoyeu delivered a striking effort to edge Kazakhstan's Maulen Mamyrov off the mat in his next match, before falling behind U.S. wrestler and 1998 world champion Sammie Henson in the semifinals without scoring a single point. He faced against Greece's Amiran Kardanov in the bronze medal match, but nearly missed out the podium by single point behind his opponent with a score 4–5, finishing only in fourth place. Determined to return again to the wrestling scene, Kantoyeu greatly emerged as a top medal contender at the 2001 World Wrestling Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, where he beat Iran's Babak Nourzad to take home the gold medal in the men's bantamweight category. In 2002, Kantoyeu took a year off from the tournament because of sustained injuries, but sought his official return at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, where he reaped an astonishing defeat from Japan's Chikara Tanabe in his opening match. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Kantoyeu qualified for his second Belarusian squad, as a 33-year-old, in the men's featherweight class (55 kg) by receiving a berth and placing second behind Cuba's René Montero from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. He lost his opening bout to Ukrainian wrestler and 2003 world bronze medalist Oleksandr Zakharuk, but scored a single triumph to subdue Kazakhstan's Baurzhan Orazgaliyev in the prelim pool. Finishing second in the elimination round and fifteenth overall, Kantoyeu could not deliver a remarkable attempt from Sydney to put him further into the quarterfinals."

  "text" : "Heber Leonidas Hart (31 March 1865 – 4 February 1948) was an English judge and jurist, particularly noted as an authority on banking law. Born in Clapham, South London, Hart was privately educated before enrolling in law at the University of London, from which he graduated in 1886 with a first-class degree. In 1887, Hart was called to the bar of the Middle Temple, where he was made a Bencher in 1923, and Treasurer in 1937. He specialised in commercial law and, in 1895, published The Law Relating to Auctions; in 1904 he published The Law of Banking (with three reprints: 1906, 1914 and 1931). In 1920 Hart was appointed as the British member of the Anglo-German, Anglo-Austrian, Anglo-Bulgarian, and Anglo-Hungarian Mixed Arbitral Tribunals, which had been established as part of the peace treaties at the end of the First World War. The tribunals would resolve cases between British subjects and those from the defeated states, \"in circumstances where the legal effects of war would otherwise have denied redress to either side\". Heber's role with the tribunals ran until their closure in 1931. A member of the Liberal Party, Hart stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the Isle of Thanet in 1892, Islington South in 1895 and Windsor in 1910. In 1939, Hart published his memoirs, Reminiscences and Reflections; he also wrote a critique of the English judicial system, The Way to Justice: a Primer of Legal Reform, which was published in 1941. In the latter book, he wrote that \"our legal system is grievously at fault\", and that it \"may be the worst in western Europe\". Hart died of heart disease at his home in Putney, south-west London on 4 February 1948. He was cremated at Putney Vale Cemetery, where his ashes were also interred."

After playing for Știința Timișoara and Știința Bucharest, he transferred to Steaua Bucharest, the military team. Schmidt defected from Romania to West Germany when he was 21 years old during a match tour with the Romanian national youth team. Being a member of the military, he was sentenced to death for desertion. In seven out of twelve German championships which VfL Gummersbach won in the Handball-Bundesliga, Hansi Schmidt played a crucial role as a goalscorer and playmaker. All in all, he played in ten finals for the German championship. Between 1967 and 1972 he became six times in a row top goalscorer of the Bundesliga's Northern League, the first five times also of the Bundesliga itself. In 1975 he became again top goalscorer of the Northern League. In 2008 he was named one of the VfL's \"All-Star-Team“. Considered to be the inventor of the delayed jump shot in handball, he worked as a coach, and later as a physical education teacher, after retiring from active play. He is married and has two children."

  "text" : "Howard Llewellyn Swisher (September 21, 1870 – August 27, 1945) was an American businessperson, real estate developie, orchardist, editor, writer, and historian. As a prominent businessman, he established several companies responsible for the development of businesses and real estate in Morgantown, West Virginia. Swisher was born in 1870 near Levels, West Virginia. He became a schoolteacher there at the age of 18, then graduated from Fairmont State Normal School (present-day Fairmont State University) and West Virginia University. He then remained in Morgantown, where he established a bookstore and stationery shop. Following the success of his bookstore, Swisher organized the Main Street Building Company, the Howard L. Swisher Company, and the Morgantown Building Association, each of which constructed a large number of residences in the city. He was also the inaugural secretary-treasurer of the West Virginia Real Estate Dealers' Association. Swisher was secretary of the Royalty Oil Company, which owned mining rights for approximately 16,000 acres (65 km2) of prospective oil lands throughout the United States. In addition, he also held prominent leadership and management roles in the Valley Wood Working Company, the Monongahela Valley Posting and Distributing Plant, the Federal Savings and Trust Company, and the West Virginia Tri-Products Company. In Hampshire County, Swisher maintained fruit growing interests and served as the president of the South Branch Merchandising Company. He was an active member of the West Virginia Democratic Party and was selected as a delegate from West Virginia to the 1936 Democratic National Convention. In 1897, Swisher co-authored History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present with West Virginia historian Hu Maxwell. The book was the first comprehensive history of Hampshire County ever compiled. He composed a collection of poetry and short stories, Briar Blossoms, in 1899, and was the editor of The Ghourki, a literary journal of poetry, short stories, and aphorisms. In 1908, Swisher published Book of Harangues, a selection of passages from The Ghourki."

In 1744 her father, seeking a promotion, is alleged to have sent Helena to submit his petition to Louis VIII at Jagdschloss Kranichstein. When Louis VIII met her, he kept her as his mistress and did not let her return. Martini, who became known as mamsell Lene, enjoyed the unlimited confidence of Louis VIII, was given a house in Darmstadt and accompanied him on his travels. She supported him in his political conflicts with the branches of the Hesse family, and brought the children of her sister to be raised in her care. She reportedly had a good relationship with the family of Louis VIII. Upon his death in 1768, she left the court with a fortune, which she later left to the children of her sister."

  "text" : "Huberto Alvarado Arellano (1927–1974), was a Guatemalan poet, essayist and communist political figure. He was born in 1927 and died in 1974 at the hands of paramilitary death squads. His interest in politics stemmed from his experiences in the Guatemalan Revolution of 1944-1945, which were marked by his immersion in leftist politics. He was soon named Secretary General of the Guatemalan Alliance of Democratic Youth. At the same time, Alvarado engaged in notable cultural and literary production, mainly through the Saker-ti (\"Dawn\" in Kaqchikel) group, of which he had been a founder. Saker-Tí was a collective of young writers committed to democratic values and to revaluing Guatemala's native cultural legacy. The group wound up joining the Communist Party en masse, and in 1949 Alvarado was appointed to the Central Committee of the party, and later to its Political Commission. On 17 June 1954, the democratically elected government of reformist Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown in a CIA engineered coup d'état that ended the Guatemalan Revolution. It was carried out by reactionary expatriates who entered Guatemala from Honduran territory, with US support and coordination. After the fall of the democratic government, one of the first measures passed by the new regime was the banning of the Party of Labor. Alvarado was then forced into exile, first in Ecuador, and later in Mexico. Alvarado soon returned to Guatemala and managed to live relatively quietly until he was again persecuted and jailed. An international campaign secured his release and subsequent return to exile in Mexico. Alvarado -who was at this time serving as Secretary General of the Guatemalan Party of Labour (as the Communist Party had been renamed in 1952), after its previous Secretary General had been captured and executed at the orders Pres. Carlos Arana- returned to his homeland in 1974. He would not live out the year. On 20 December 1974 Huberto Alvarado was wounded and captured by government forces. The next day, his tortured and mutilated body was dumped on the outskirts of Guatemala City."

He was elected at the 1812 general election as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Berwick-upon-Tweedin Northumberland, and re-elected in 1818.At the 1820 general election he was defeated by Sir David Milne, but that result was reversed on petition in July 1820, and St Paul was re-elected later the same monthwithout a contest. However, he died on 1 November, age 43,before he could resume his seat.His death triggered a by-election which was contested by the Scottish Tory nabob James Balfour and the Whig baronet Sir Francis Blake.

  "text" : "Herbert Sydney \"Bert\" Sears (1907 – December 23, 1993) was an English-born politician in Saskatchewan, Canada. He served as mayor of Saskatoon from 1972 to 1976. Sears was born in Kent in 1907. His father emigrated to Saskatoon in 1910 where he ran a fish and chip shop, but at the start of World War I he joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force. On December 25, 1917, Sears and his mother reached Saskatoon where they were later reunited with his father. After completing his schooling, Sears began working at a bakery, where he became a member of a union. Joining the bakery's union was the beginning of his involvement in the labour movements of Saskatoon. In 1927, he married Mary Dubets with whom he had four sons. Sears was employed with Federated Co-op from 1944 until his retirement in 1967; he became regional warehouse manager in 1949. He also served as the second president of the Saskatoon board of the Canadian Congress of Labour. He married his second wife Phyllis after the death of Mary. Sears was a member of Saskatoon city council from 1951 to 1958 and again from 1964 to 1971. During his service on the council he was a member of various committees including engineering, parks, planning and board of trade. He succeeded Sidney Buckwold as mayor in which role he served from 1972 to 1976. During his mayorship the ward system of council election was reintroduced in Saskatoon. In recognition of his service to the community he was awarded the centennial medal in 1967. He died at the age of 86 and was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery. Sears Bay, Sears Crescent and Sears Place in Arbor Creek and Herbert S. Sears Park in Fairhaven were named in his honour."

He was the owner of several logging and sporting camps in the area including Bulldog Camps and Lake Parlin House. He is noted for his work ethic, business savvy, and stubbornness that often attributed to his success. Born into a large family in Jackman, McKenney was the eighth of thirteen children and often embraced the strenuous life that came with living in rural Maine in the nineteenth century. He was home-schooled and became an eager student of the outdoors. He began logging at an early age and truly made a name for himself in 1898 when he built a successful mile and quarter long log sluice on Enchanted Pond, then referred to as “Bulldog Pond”."

During his tenure, from 1977 to 1985, he shifted the organization's focus from promoting marksmanship and sports shooting towards advocacy for less restrictive gun laws. Under Carter's leadership, the NRA became more vehement and less compromising on gun rights issues. It also tripled its membership and gained considerable political influence."

  "text" : "Hidekazu Yokoyama (横山 秀和 Yokoyama Hidekazu, born April 7, 1971 in Akita, Akita) is a retired amateur Japanese freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's light heavyweight category. He won two bronze medals in both freestyle and Greco-Roman at the Asian Games (1994 and 1998), and then represented his nation Japan in two editions of the Olympic Games (1996 and 2004). Having worked as a physical education teacher at Akita Commercial High School, Yokoyama also trained as part of the school's wrestling squad under his personal coach Katsuhiko Saito. When Japan hosted the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Yokoyama enchanted the home crowd inside Higashi Stadium by defeating South Korea's Yang Hyun-Mo for a bronze medal in the 82-kg division. The following year, he placed eleventh at the World Championships, and then rounded out the fourth spot in the same class at the 1996 Asian Wrestling Championships in Hangzhou, China. Yokoyama entered the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta on his major debut in the men's 82 kg class. He pinned Romania's Nicolae Ghiţă in his opening bout, but suffered a stunning 4–2 upset from his rival Yang Hyun-Mo in the second round. Yokoyama lost a chance to dismantle Turkey's Sabahattin Öztürk for a victory in the third round repechage 1–7, dropping him to eleventh spot. Shortly after the Games, Yokoyama turned his focus to Greco-Roman wrestling, and proved particularly successful with a bronze medal effort in the same category at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand, outclassing Iran's Behrouz Jamshidi in the process. He also sought his bid to compete for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, but missed a spot from the Olympic Tournament. Yokoyama made his early retirement in 2000, but came back from the sport three years later to further concentrate on his freestyle wrestling career. Eight years after his first Olympics, Yokoyama qualified for his second Japanese squad, as a 33-year-old veteran, in the men's 84 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, he guaranteed a spot on the Japanese team by placing second from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Bratislava, Slovakia. He lost his opening match 1–5 to Iran's Majid Khodaei, but bounced back to hold India's Anuj Kumar down the mat with 8–11 decision to close the prelim pool. Finishing second in the pool and tenth overall, Yokoyama failed to advance further into the quarterfinals."

Sooden was born and raised in Zambia. His parents are Sikhs from Kashmir. His great-grandfather fought for the British Indian Army in World War I and died in Basra in 1916 during the Mesopotamian Campaign. As his main inspiration for peace work, he cites his grandfather who was a career soldier in the British Indian Army and then the Indian Army. He says he was also motivated by the extraordinary rendition and torture of a university classmate, Maher Arar, and the experience of a friend who survived the World Trade Center attack on 11 September 2001. Sooden holds degrees in Computer Engineering from McGill University in Montréal, Canada and English literature from the University of Auckland in New Zealand. He was a member of the University of Auckland's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. On 23 July 2006, Sooden did an extensive interview with journalist Sahar Ghumkhor, in which he discussed his reflections on his visits in Iraq before the kidnapping, his captivity, his release and the response of the media."

  "text" : "Henry Murray was a British taxidermist and founder of the taxidermy firm Murray of Carnforth. The business was established in 1872 by Henry Murray and continued with his son Albert James until Albert retired in 1961, originally trading as H. Murray and later as H. Murray and son from premises in Scotland Rd., Carnforth. The Murrays produced taxidermy of the highest quality equal with other top class taxidermist of that era. Their output was various, producing work for museums, most notably Kendal, decorative cases for the private market and trophies for the hunting fraternity. The most often seen cases are the \"picture frame\" type which Murray is renowned for, very well executed with a painted background. Not as numerous but just as well presented are his all glass cases containing singles, pairs or family groups, mostly to be found in museums. Kendal Museum houses the finest collection of Murray taxidermy including extinct species and is well worth a visit. Less often seen are cases of the box type and with glass sides and front and also domes. The Murrays usually labelled their work. Cases having a large label on the back and a small label on the inside, either on the background or groundwork, there are exceptions as unlabelled Murray cases can be found."

The father-son duo were raising money for a charity organisation based in Pakistan, The Citizens Foundation, which educates Pakistan's poorest children. They departed Indiana on 19 June 2014 and were attempting to fly around the world in 30 days – a 26,500-mile (42,673-km) journey with 25 stops in 15 countries – and hoped to break the world record for the youngest pilot-in-command in history to circumnavigate the earth in a single-engine plane in 30 days. They were on the final leg of their trip, flying from Pago Pago in American Samoa to Hawaii via Kiribati in their Hawker Beechcraft Bonanza – also planning a stop in California before returning to Indiana – when their plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean on 23 July 2014 shortly after taking off from Pago Pago International Airport. Haris Suleman is buried at Maple Hill Cemetery in Plainfield, Indiana."

  "text" : "Henry Charles Edward Wheeler (29 July 1925 – 22 November 2004) was an English naval signalman during World War II. Wheeler was born on 29 July 1925 in Bath, England, to Henry Arthur Wheeler and Rose (ne Snook), and was the eldest in a family of six. He was from Vernhan Grove in Bath, where his civilian role was as a tailor's assistant. He joined the Royal Navy in 1943, and undertook his naval training at HMS Impregnable, a shore establishment at Plymouth. He went to France on 7 June 1944, the day after D-Day, and was later stationed in Rotterdam. While there, he began a romantic relationship with a Dutch woman, named Dine. Shortly after the war's end, he appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs, on 24 November 1945, at the age of 20. He was chosen to appear as he was serving, as part of Naval Party 1745, on an unspecified \"small island off the European coast\" – the nearest thing available to a real castaway. One of the recordings he selected was \"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\" sung by Anne Ziegler and Webster Booth. — \"a song I find myself singing when I think about my girl [Dine]\". He married a Miss Denboer before 1947, outside the UK. They had two sons, in 1947 and 1950. It was later revealed that the island on which Wheeler was serving was Norderney — one of the East Frisian Islands off the north coast of Germany, where the British Forces Network provided the live outside broadcast, via Hamburg. He died on 22 November 2004 in Sodbury, South Gloucestershire. He was cremated at Westerleigh Crematorium."

  "text" : "Jules Henry Sherek (1900-1967) was a British theatrical manager, known for producing the plays of T. S. Eliot. Sherek was born on 23 April 1900, at 2 Guilford Street, London, to Bernard a merchant (and later an international theatrical agent), and Margarette (née Jacoby). He was educated at the Waren Gymnasium in Germany, where he became fluent in German, and at a school in Switzerland, where he learned to speak French. He was severely wounded while in the Near East during World War I, having lied about his age in order to enlist while only 15. Following the war, and after a period in the United States working for David Belasco and at a theatrical agency, he took over his father's agency. In 1937, he married the actress Pamela Carme (real name Kathleen Pamela Mary Corona Boscawen; 1902–1995), who was the daughter of the Evelyn Boscawen, 7th Viscount Falmouth. She retired from acting to be her husband's business partner. During World War II, he again served in the British army, becoming a major before being invalided out in 1944. He produced the T.S. Elliot plays The Cocktail Party, The Confidential Clerk, and The Elder Statesman. All were directed by E. Martin Browne. He appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 15 June 1959. Examples of his correspondence with Sir Cecil Beaton are included in the latter's papers, in the library of St John's College, Cambridge. After spending his retirement in Geneva, he died in Venice on 23 September 1967."

In childhood, he played saxophone and flute, and by the age of 17, when he joined the union, was already performing theatre orchestras in various towns and cites. He established several branches of the union, and eventually gave up playing music, to devote all his energies to its administration, accepting a post as a full-time official in 1937. Although he gave notice of resignation in August 1962, during a dispute over internal policy matters, he was persuaded to withdraw it, and continued as General Secretary until his eventual retirement in 1971. He appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 9 November 1964, and died in 1975."

  "text" : "Johann (Hans) Hermann Schrader (15 February 1869, Stolp – 5 November 1948, Berlin) was a German classical archaeologist and art historian. He was a student at the Universities of Marburg and Berlin, where he was a pupil of Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz. After obtaining his doctorate, he, along with Theodor Wiegand, received a travel grant from the German Archaeological Institute (DAI). Subsequently, he relocated to Athens, where under the leadership of Wilhelm Dörpfeld, he took part in excavations at the Athenian Acropolis. Here, he was entrusted with processing ancient marble sculptures, a main theme of his future research. In 1896, under the leadership of Carl Humann, he began excavatory work at Priene (Asia Minor). Here, he worked alongside Theodor Wiegand. After Humann's death later the same year, he continued work at Priene up until 1899. From 1899 to 1901 he worked as an assistant director of Berlin museums, afterwards serving as second secretary of the German Archaeological Institute at Athens (1901–05). In 1905 he was appointed professor of classical archaeology at the University of Innsbruck, followed by professorships at the Universities of Graz (from 1908) and Vienna (from 1910). At Vienna he was also in charge of the collection of antiquities. In 1914 he accepted a professorial post at the newly established University of Frankfurt. Schrader made significant contributions towards the reconstruction of Pergamon Altar as well as to the final assembly of the so-called \"Kritios Boy\" of the Athenian Acropolis."

He went to Hong Kong to join the Palmer and Turner architect firm as an assistant in around 1892 or 1893. He became Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1897. He succeeded Arthur Turner as the partner of the Palmer & Turner in 1901 until 1928 and an authorised architect from 1903. He had designed many of Hong Kong's best known buildings. His brother, Lennox Godfrey Bird, was also an architect and partner of the Palmer & Turner. In 1911, he was appointed member of the Authorised Architects Committee vice Arthur Turner on leave and again in 1917. He subsequently took Edward Osborne's seat as the unofficial member of the Licensing Board. He was also member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong appointed in 1918 and again in 1921 and became a regular member from 1923 until 1927. He left Hong Kong on the SS Empress of Russia on 20 April 1927. During his residence in Hong Kong, he was the owner of a property on Lugard Road (No. 27) from 1914, which was built by his brother Lennox, until it was sold to the Taikoo Dockyard & Engineering Co. in 1930 as a residence of their staff."

  "text" : "Sir Henry Morland (9 April 1837 — 28 July 1891) was a British administrator in the Bombay Presidency of India who began his career in the navy. He was also a member of several learned societies. The third son of John Morland, a barrister-at-law, and Elizabeth, daughter of James Thompson, Henry was schooled at Heversham and Bromsgrove apart from the tutorship of Dr Webster of Christ's Hospital. In 1852 he went to join the Indian navy (originally known as Bombay Marine, a part of the East India Company), posted initially on the Akbar and later as a midshipman on the steamer Queen. He worked off the northeastern coast of Africa and saw action at Suhgra in 1853. In November 1857 he became first mate on the Dalhousie. He saw action again at Perim in January 1857 and at Jeddah in July 1858 and rose to become fourth lieutenant on the Assaye. On 30 April 1863, the Indian Navy was abolished and he was put on the retired list and he moved to the Indian Marine (under the British government) and worked on submarine cable laying from 1864 to 1865. He worked during the Abyssinian expedition of 1867 supervising the transport of men and material. He became a transport officer at Bombay and then a conservator of the Bombay port from 1873 and briefly as acting secretary at the Bombay port trust. He also took interest in the Bombay municipal works and became a member of the corporation in 1868 and the town council in 1877. He headed the committee for the Bombay jubilee address which he presented to the Queen leading to his being knighted on 30 June 1887. He was a member of the Bombay Geographical Society, a fellow of the Bombay University and a grandmaster in the freemasonry establishment in India. He died at Rampart Row in Bombay on 28 July 1891. He married Alice Mary Critchley in 1870 and after her death in 1871 married Fanny Helen Hannah Carandini in 1875. Morland road in Mumbai was named after him."

He was most influential, however, after crossing the Atlantic to preach and write in the United States. Dr. Lockyer was invited to preach at the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Moody Bible Institute, and this began his ministry in the United States. In the 1930s, the Institute published a number of his sermons, and Zondervan soon began to do the same. Dr. Lockyer also became influential in the Keswick Higher Life movement, ministering and publishing on both sides of the Atlantic. In his later life, his ministry was entirely focused on publishing, and his son, Herbert Lockyer, Jr., became his editor. Billy Graham wrote, \"Dr. Lockyer was unquestionably one of the spiritual giants of our century, and his prolific writings will continue to make an impact on countless Christians for generations to come if our Lord tarries.\""

Coutard was stricken with pulmonary tuberculosis and so he moved to the alpine area of Jura and took up the hobby of mountaineering. Coutard practiced medicine during this recovery period. He then returned to Paris and started his researches with the recently discovered Radium at the Laboratoire d’Essais of Gif in the banlieue of Paris. In 1912 Coutard publish his first work on the therapeutic use of Radium emanation."

  "text" : "Henry Tansley Luddington (9 December 1854 – 14 April 1922) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and the \"Gentlemen of England\" side in the 1870s. He was born at Littleport, Cambridgeshire and died at Ashdon, Essex. Luddington was educated at Uppingham School, where he was coached by the famous cricketer H. H. Stephenson, at The King's School, Ely and at Jesus College, Cambridge. He had a trial match for the Cambridge University cricket team in 1874, but did not get into the first eleven until 1876 when he achieved some success with his right-arm fast bowling, delivering the ball round arm. His batting as a right-handed tail-ender was negligible. Picked for the 1876 University Match against Oxford University, he took 5 for 51 in the first innings and 4 for 72 in the second as Cambridge won by seven wickets; in the first innings, he shared the Oxford wickets with William Patterson, with whom he had been at school at Uppingham. Luddington's best bowling performance came for Cambridge in 1877 against the Marylebone Cricket Club: he took 5 for 28 as MCC, including W. G. Grace, were dismissed for just 60. In the 1877 University Match, Luddington and Patterson again shared the Oxford first-innings wickets equally, Luddington taking 5 for 90, but Oxford won the match easily. After leaving Cambridge, Luddington played only one further first-class match, appearing for the Gentlemen of England in a fixture at Cambridge in 1878. Luddington appears not to have followed any career after graduating from Cambridge in 1877; he was a Justice of the Peace and a county councillor for the Isle of Ely after that district achieved county status with local government reform in 1888. He bought Walton's Park at Ashdon on the Essex/Cambridgeshire border in 1917 and died there five years later."

  "text" : "Han Bangqing (Chinese: 韓邦慶; pinyin: Hán Bāngqìng; Wade–Giles: Han Pang-ch'ing; 1856–1894), also known by the given name Ji (寄), courtesy name Ziyun (子雲), and pseudonyms Taixian (太仙), Dayi Shanren (大一山人), Hua Ye Lian Nong (花也憐儂), and Sanqing (三慶), was a late-Qing dynasty Chinese writer from Lou County, Songjiang Prefecture, Jiangsu (now a district of Shanghai). As a child he went with his father to live in Beijing. He failed at the imperial examinations many times, even though he had a reputation as a prodigy in his childhood, and eventually wrote for the newspaper Shen Bao in Shanghai.In 1892, he started what can be considered China's first for-profit literary magazine, the Wonderbook of Shanghai (海上奇書; Haishang qishu), which lasted eight months, and in which he published his novel Shanghai Hua in instalments. The novel has been widely acclaimed as a classic (particularly by Lu Xun, Hu Shih, and Eileen Chang) but is little read today, likely due to its being written entirely in Wu Chinese, unintelligible to Mandarin speakers. It was translated into Mandarin and English by Eileen Chang. After Chang's death in 1995, the translation was discovered among her papers and published in English as The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai in 2005 after revision by Eva Hung. Not long after publication of the novel, Han Bangqing died in 1894, aged 38."

Bixby is notable in his own right for his high standing in his profession, for his technical contributions to it, and for his service in the American Civil War. However, he is best known for having had as his \"cub pilot\" (that is, apprentice or trainee) the young man known to him as Sam Clemens, later to become famous under his pen name as American author Mark Twain. Twain's descriptions of Bixby's character and pedagogic style form a good part of his memoir Life on the Mississippi, and it was through this medium that Bixby—much to his annoyance—became well-known beyond the circles of his family, friends and profession."

He was probably born in Aachen, Cologne and left in 1537 because of religious persecution, and found refuge in the Electoral Palatinate. He became a citizen of the city of Speyer. In 1546 he was appointed official court painter for Frederick II, Elector Palatine. After the death of Frederick in 1556, Besser continued as court painter to Otto Henry, Elector Palatine. Besser was primarily a portrait painter. Before these portraits were detectable through documentation, attributions of his works were originally assigned to either Master of Pfalz or Master of Margrave. These names were given to the painter because of the frequent representation of the Palatinate princes. Besser demonstrated none of the leading visual style of the Renaissance in Germany. His cool portraits with their motionless poses and rigid facial expressions show a distant contemplation, which seems to follow a sober objectivity of Dutch painting of the period of the Reformation."

  "text" : "Hillary Chute (born Boston, MA, 1976) is an American literary scholar and an expert on comics and graphic narratives. She is an Associate Professor in the Department of English at the University of Chicago and an Associate Faculty member of the University’s Department of Visual Arts. Chute received tenure at the University of Chicago in 2013. In 2006, she co-edited the \"Graphic Narrative\" special issue of Modern Fiction Studies. Chute was a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows from 2007 to 2010. Her first book, Graphic Women, covers the work of Aline Kominsky-Crumb, Phoebe Gloeckner, Lynda Barry, Marjane Satrapi, and cartoonist Alison Bechdel. Her book, Disaster Drawn, was released by Harvard University Press in January 2016. It investigates how hand-drawn comics has come of age as a serious medium for engaging history and explores the ways graphic narratives by diverse artists, including Jacques Callot, Francisco Goya, Keiji Nakazawa, Art Spiegelman, and Joe Sacco, document the disasters of war. Chute is the Associate Editor of Art Spiegelman’s MetaMaus, which won a 2011 National Jewish Book Award in the category Biography, Autobiography, Memoir, as well as a 2012 Eisner Award in the category of best comics-related book. She founded the Modern Language Association’s Discussion Group on Comics and Graphic Narratives in 2009. Chute collaborated with Bechdel in co-teaching “Lines of Transmission: Comics and Autobiography” at the University of Chicago as part of a Mellon grant, as well as organizing the “Comics: Philosophy and Practice” conference in 2012. In 2014, they co-authored the comics piece “Bartheses” in Critical Inquiry. In 2013, Chute wrote a piece for Poetry about the relation of comics and poetry."

  "text" : "Herbert Charles Malkin (21 September 1836 – 18 August 1913) was an English lawyer and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University in 1858. He was born in Kolkata, then called Calcutta, in India and died at Corrybrough, Tomatin, Inverness-shire, Scotland. Malkin was the son of Sir Benjamin Heath Malkin, a judge of the supreme court in Calcutta, who died only a year after Herbert was born. His grandfather was also named Benjamin Heath Malkin and was a writer and educator who brought the works of William Blake to public attention. Herbert Malkin was educated at Charterhouse School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating from Cambridge University in 1859 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. While at Cambridge, Malkin played several cricket matches for the university side, and two of them, both in 1858, have been judged to be of first-class status. He appears to have played as a batsman, though it is not known if he was right- or left-handed, and there is no evidence that he bowled; his only innings of note was a score of 27 made as an opening batsman in the match against the Cambridge Town Club in which he made his first-class debut. He continued to play minor cricket for amateur clubs, including Southgate Cricket Club, across the 1860s but played no more matches with first-class status. After graduating from Cambridge, Malkin worked for a time as a schoolmaster at Charterhouse, his old school, before qualifying as a barrister. From 1871 he acted as Clerk of Public Bills in the Clerk of the Parliaments office in the House of Lords; from 1897 to his retirement in 1901 he had the title \"chief clerk\". From 1879 to 1897 he was responsible for the Annual Statutes publication which recorded new laws in the period before the codification of UK statutes under Halsbury's Statutes, and he served on committees dealing with statute law revision. He was also a local politician, being a member of Kensington Borough Council and a Justice of the Peace for the City of London. He inherited a grouse moor estate in Scotland from an uncle and it was there that he died in 1913."

Howie. George A. Zentmyer, professor and chairman in the plant pathology department at the University of California, Riverside, arranged for Gill to be appointed adjunct professor, with his own laboratory at the campus from 1968 to the early 1980s. Working with Zentmyer, Gill continued his work on elucidating the genus phytophthora by disc electrophoresis and serological techniques, which pioneered the fungi classifications in the field Plant Pathology. Gill taught his techniques to graduate students at the university and contributed articles in the Press Enterprise (a newspaper in Riverside County, California, USA) about various plant diseases. In February 4, 1993, the Press Enterprise published a feature article on Gill and his work on citrus-hungry aphids that caused the loss of citrus crops extending from Central America."

  "text" : "Hessy Levinsons Taft (born 17 May 1934) is a woman, born to Jewish parents in Berlin, best known for having been featured prominently as an infant in Nazi propaganda after her photo was surreptitiously entered in, and then selected as the winner of, a contest to find the most beautiful Aryan baby. Taft's image became one of the most subversive of the 20th century when it was subsequently distributed widely by the Nazi party in a variety of materials, such as magazines and postcards, to promote Aryanism. Her parents, Jacob and Pauline Levinsons, were unaware of their photographer's decision to enter the photograph into the contest until learning that the photo of their daughter had been selected by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels as the winner of the contest. Fearing that the Nazis would discover that their family was Jewish, Taft's mother informed the photographer that they were Jewish. The photographer told her mother, Pauline, that he knew they were Jewish and deliberately entered Taft's photograph into the contest because he \"wanted to make the Nazis ridiculous\". Taft told the German-language newspaper Bild that \"I can laugh about it now\" in July 2014, \"but if the Nazis had known who I really was, I wouldn't be alive.\" She is now a chemistry professor in New York."

  "text" : "Sir (Albert) Henry Self KCB, KBE (1890-1975) was a British civil servant. Prior to and during the Second World War he was responsible for arranging purchase of American aircraft to fulfil the needs of the Royal Air Force. Post war he held a post in the Ministry of Civil Aviation as the Deputy Chairman. The son of Samuel Adolphus Theodore Self, a tram conductor, Henry Self was, prior to his civil service career, employed as a dishwasher on the Fulham Road. During the war he was part of the British Air Commission in America. Initially he was the air representative to the British Purchasing Commission which was purchasing all kinds of armaments and war materiel in the US. Generally at the start of the war, American fighters were lacking compared to European designs. Self asked if North American Aviation could produce the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk under licence. North American offered to draw up a superior design to the Warhawk and bring it to production in a shorter time than setting a production line of the Curtiss design. This led to the North American Mustang which entered service with the RAF in 1941. It subsequently entered service with the USAAF being named the P-51 under U.S. Service. Post war, Henry became Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, replacing Sir William Hildred. He was married to Audrey, daughter of Sir John Otter- at one time Mayor of Brighton- and granddaughter of the founder of, inter alia, Lancing College, Hurstpierpoint College and Ardingly College, Nathaniel Woodard. Henry Self had two sons: Peter Self (1919-1999)- whose sons are Will Self and Jonathan Self- and Michael Self QC (1921-1998), who married Penny Drinkwater (daughter of the playwright John Drinkwater) and had two daughters: Susie Self (who married Michael Christie) and Melanie Self (who married Orlando Harvey Wood and had three children: Harry Harvey Wood, Robert Harvey Wood and Poppy Harvey Wood). Already a Companion of the Order of the Bath, he was made Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the King's 1939 Birthday Honours list.He received the Knighthood in the Order of the Bath in 1947."

He studied law with his father after college, and he was admitted to practice law in December 1847. he married Caroline H. Powe on June 7, 1849. When McIver's father died in July 1850, Governor Seabrook appointed McIver to complete his father's term as the solicitor (prosecutor) for the eastern circuit of the state. At the end of the term, McIver did not run for a full term; however, the successor himself died in office, and McIver was again appointed to conclude the unexpired term. At the end of that second term, McIver was elected to a full term. He continued being re-elected to the position until 1868 when he was removed from office as part of Reconstruction. McIver served in the Confederate army and returned to his law practice after the Civil War. On May 19, 1877, he was elected as an associate justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court to fill the unexpired term of the Justice Willard who had become chief justice of the court. The General Assembly elected McIver unanimously to a full term in December 1879. He served in that position until he was elected and immediately sworn in as chief justice on December 1, 1891, replacing Chief Justice Simpson. McIver died on January 12, 1903. He is buried at Old Saint Davids Episcopal Church Cemetery, Cheraw, South Carolina."

  "text" : "Harry Davis (born 1898 in Romania, died on July 25, 1946 in Montreal) was a Montreal gangster and the city’s last \"edge man\" (a strictly Montreal term used to signify the go-between for gamblers, politicians and police, the ‘edge’ was the undisputed boss of all vice in the city)  back when the ‘Jewish Mafia’ ran the city. Davis, a Jewish mobster, ran Montreal’s underworld for a year before he was shot to death in one of his betting emporiums at 1224 St. Catherine Street, by Louis Bercovitch (alias Joe Miller), a rival Jewish mobster. Although Montreal was the gambling capital of Canada  and known as a ‘wide open city’ across North America, Davis’ death shocked the public. It acted as a wake up call for the masses of society in that it showed them, for the first time in almost a decade, that vice and organized crime in Montreal was real. Public opinion and an increasingly involved press put pressure on the police to begin taking real action against vice within the city. Fernand Dufresnse, the chief of police, publicly denounced and fired Captain Arthur Taché, the head of the Morality squad (the police division which was in charge of dealing with institutionalized vice within the city), in order to avoid a judicial inquiry into the matter. Shortly after Taché was fired, Dufresne hired Pacifique “Pax” Plante, a not very well known lawyer, to lead the Morality Squad. Plante would lead a crusade against organized crime and institutionalized vice in Montreal. Even after he was fired from his position as head of the Morality Squad in 1948, he continued to target vice and organized crime through his newspaper column, “Sous le règne de la pègre” in Le Devoir.Plante worked in conjunction with Gérald Pelletier writing daily articles for Le Devoir with the intent to inform and mobilize the public against organized crime. Consequently, his articles drew massive public support and resulted in an increase in public demands to end vice within the city. By 1950 it had become clear that the public were willing to back Plante in his crusade against corruption. In 1950 he teamed up with Jean Drapeau to launch the Caron Inquiry, the city’s largest inquiry of the twentieth century on organized crime."

He was appointed Deputy Master of the Mint (based in the Tower of London) to Sir Ralph Freeman from 1662 to 1667 and sole Master from 1667 to 1680. Slingsby introduced the idea of stamping the inscription \"Decus et Tutamen\" around the edge of silver coins to prevent clipping. He built a new house at Park Wood, Burrough Green. The position of Master was normally held for life, but in 1680 Slingsby was suspended from office on the grounds of incompetence. His financial accounts were so faulty that he was suspected of fraud and his property temporarily seized to make good the losses. The duties of Master were then executed by a commission pending Slingsby's resignation in 1686. He died a debtor around 1690. Elected an Original Fellow of the Royal Society in 1663, he was expelled from the Society in 1675 for non-payment of dues. He had married Ann Cave, with whom he had sons Anthony and Henry."

It examines Zurob’s work from 2002 to 2012 and sheds light on the personal and historical events that contextualize it.

  "text" : "Harrison David Horblit (1 May 1912, in Boston – 8 March 1988, in Danbury) was a philanthropist and collector of books, manuscripts, and photographs. He is famous for the Harrison D. Horblit Collection of Early Photographs. Horblit graduated from Harvard University in 1933, then graduated from Harvard Business School and became an executive in textile manufacture. For about 30 years he was president of Colonial Fabrics, a Manhattan company, which closed in 1966 when he retired. In the 1960s Horblit purchased the entire photography collection of Thomas Phillipps and added to it for about 20 years. Horblit’s wife Jean (née Mermin) donated most of this collection to Harvard’s Houghton Library in 1995. From March 10 to May 26, 1999, after three years of cataloguing, re-housing and conserving the collection, Houghton Library exhibited the collection to the public, along with a two-day symposium on the 10th and 11 March. According to the Harvard Gazette, \"This premier collection of more than 7,000 items —including daguerreotypes, photographic prints, books illustrated with original photographs, early photographic albums, cameras, and manuscripts— documents the discovery of photography from the 1830s through the turn of the century.\" Horblit was a collector of rare books related to the history of science, navigation and mathematics. In 1964 the Grolier Club published his book One hundred books famous in science: based on an exhibition at the Grolier Club. About 1964 Horblit designed a \"Bibliographical Collation Computer\", a 128 x 245 mm card in a plastic sleeve which operates much like a slide rule in which the letters of the alphabet are correlated with the pagination values of formats of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 leaves. The card was copyrighted in 1964 and copies were sold by the Grolier Club. In 1965 the Horblits purchased the Wagoner mansion in Ridgefield, Connecticut. For many years Harrison and Jean Horblit spent two months each summer yachting along the Maine coast. Harrison Horblit was survived by his wife, two children and two grandchildren. Jean Horblit died at the age of 98."

  "text" : "Hedwig von Restorff (December 14, 1906, Berlin – 1962) is best known for her discovery of the von Restorff effect or isolation effect. Hedwig von Restorff attended the University of Berlin where she would also obtain her PhD. Von Restorff studied and practiced psychology according to Gestalt traditions. During her psychological career, von Restorff worked at the University of Berlin as a postdoctoral assistant to Wolfgang Köhler. During her time at the University of Berlin, von Restorff published two papers. The first touched on her findings of the isolation paradigm experiments ran in 1933, while the second was co-authored with Köhler. Her writings have never been published in English which has caused some work to be lost due to secondary accounts."

Many of his sculptures involve mothers or indigenous heroes, but he also did official sculptors of well known Greenlanders. His paintings draw on similar themes of Greenlandic legend and mothers while having the European influence of Impressionism. He played a role in the history of Greenland theatre as well. He also wrote several books depicting Nuuk. His father was pastor Niels Lynge who was a painter in his own right."

Stubbs immigrated from England at the age of 16, and made his first Broadway appearance at the age of 31 in The Bad Samaritan, which had a short run of fifteen performances in September 1905 at the Garden Theatre. The Internet Broadway Database (IBDB) has him appearing in only eight plays over the next 23 years, the last of which was 1928's The Big Fight which had a month run at the Majestic Theatre in September/October 1928. In 1929, he would move to Hollywood and begin his film career, which spanned the first fifteen years of the sound era of the industry; he would appear in over 50 films during that time. At the beginning of his career in the movies, he would have several leading roles, as in his first film, Alibi, but for the most part he was relegated to the smaller roles of a character actor. Stubbs died on May 9, 1950, at the age of 75."

  "text" : "Hannah Ryggen (21 March 1894, Malmö – 2 February 1970) was a Swedish-born Norwegian textile artist. Self-trained, she worked on a standing loom constructed by her husband, the painter Hans Ryggen. She lived on a farm on a Norwegian Fjord and dyed her yarn with local plants. She was a pacifist who subscribed to Scandinavian feminist and leftist journals, and was active in the Norwegian Communist Party and international workers’ movements. She paid close attention to the rise of fascism in Europe, and made work in direct response to it. Her 1935 tapestry 'Etiopia' (Ethipoia) was triggered by Benito Mussolini’s invasion of the African country. It was shown at the Paris World’s Fair in 1937, next to Picasso’s Guernica (1937). Etiopia was also shown in 1939 at the New York World’s Fair, but there was a cloth covering the part of the scene with a spear piercing through Mussolini’s head. In 1936 she wove one tapestry called 'Hitlerteppet' (The Hitler Carpet), with two decapitated figures kneeling before a hovering cross, and one called 'Drømmedød' (Death of Dreams) depicting prisoners and murderous Nazis in a concentration camp. According to Marta Kuzma, although Ryggan \"shared and affinity with Käthe Kollwitz, who also selected as her narrative the social, spiritual, and political disorder of her time, Ryggan bypassed Kollwitz's tendency to draft allegorical figures (such as Black Anna) and instead identified historical individuals who forged, installed, and enabled the totalitarian regime in those years – Mussolini, Hitler, Göring, Quisling, Churchill, and the Norwegian writer Knut Hamsun.\" Ryggen created about one hundred large carpets in her lifetime. Following the formal traditions of 17th and 18th century Norwegian folk textile arts, her works combine figurative and abstract elements. Her 'Henders bruk' from 1949 was the first textile artwork acquired by the National Gallery of Norway. Twenty eight of her works were shown in a solo show at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm in 1962, and she was the first female Norwegian artist to be represented at the Venice Biennale, in 1964. In 2012 a selection of her woven works were included in dOCUMENTA (13) in Kassel."

His botanical studies included trips throughout most of Sweden, to northern Norway (1869, 1870 and 1891) and to the lower Yenisei valley in Siberia (1876). From 1873 onward, he performed phenological research in various parts of Sweden. The liverwort genera Arnellia Lindb. and Arnelliella C. Massal. commemorate his name."

He was the first recorder of the Awa'uq Massacre in the Russian America of Shelikhov-Golikov Company. Henrik Holmberg followed in 1851 to document an evolved origin story and several other stories as told by Arsenti Aminak (his memory of Russian conquest at Awa’uq that Aminak survived as a young boy). In 1839 he became a student of the Mining Inspectorate of Finland, in 1841 was registered as an extra conductor and in 1850 went to pan for gold to Russian America. There Holmberg assembled a rich collection of natural history specimens and studied local languages and ethnography of Alaska Natives (as Die Konjagen = Koniag Alutiiq of Kodiak, Die Thlinkithen = Tlingit, Die Thnaina = Dena'ina of Kenai). After his return to Finland in 1852 he issued \"Etnographische Skizzen über die Völker des russischen Amerika\" (in Acta Societatis Scientiarum Fennicae. 1856: Vol. 4, 1863: Vol. 7), later - Mineralogischer Wegweiser durch Finland (1857) and Materialien zur Geognosie Finlands (1858). Holmberg worked in the historical museum of the Helsinki University and published a description of the Finnish archaeological finds from the Neolithic and Bronze Age, List and illustrations of Finnish antiquities (1863), the first detailed work on this subject."
