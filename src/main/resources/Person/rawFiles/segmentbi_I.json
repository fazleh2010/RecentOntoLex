  "text" : "Ivy Therese Low Litvinov (Russian: Айви Вальтеровна Литвинова) (4 June 1889 – 16 April 1977) was an English-Russian writer and translator, and wife of Soviet diplomat and foreign minister Maxim Litvinov. She was also known as Ivy Low, Ivy Litvinova or Ivy Litvinoff. She was born into an Anglo-Jewish family. Her father Walter was a friend of H. G. Wells. In 1894 her father died, and in 1896 her mother Alice remarried to John Alexander (Sandy) Herbert, and published some novels under the name Alice Herbert. In 1916 Ivy Low married Maxim Litvinov, who at the time was a revolutionary exile living in London. They had two children, Mikhail (Misha) and Tatiana (Tanya). Following the Russian Revolution Maxim returned home in 1918, and she followed him two years later. Maxim Litvinov became a prominent diplomat and served as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs (foreign minister) from 1930 to 1939, and Soviet ambassador to the United States from 1941 to 1943. He died in 1951, having survived the purges of nearly all of his closest colleagues despite having fallen out of favour with Stalin on more than one occasion. Apart from brief stays abroad as part of her husband's diplomatic service, she lived in the Soviet Union for most of her adult life before moving permanently to Hove, England in 1972. She died in 1977. Looking back on the precarious situation that Maxim and Ivy had faced in the Stalin era, George Kennan wrote \"It is one of the wonders of the age that Ivy survived to die a natural death.\""

During this period Ibrahim resided in the Hamdanid court in Iraq. In 945, Nuh I dismissed the Muhtajid Abu 'Ali Chaghani from the governorship of Khurasan after hearing complaints of the latter's harsh rule, and sought to replace him with a Turk, the Simjurid Ibrahim ibn Simjur. Abu 'Ali refused to accept his dismissal and rebelled. He then convinced Ibrahim to come from Iraq, which he agreed to do so; Ibrahim first travelled to Tikrit, and then to Hamadan, and then reached the Samanid capital of Bukhara, which he captured with the aid of Abu 'Ali in 947, and crowned himself as the ruler of the Samanids. The rebellion of Ibrahim and Abu 'Ali quickly spread around the Samanid state, and even spread as far as Ray in Jibal. Ibrahim's rule was shortly recognized by the Abbasid caliph. However, he was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers. The fate of Ibrahim is not known."

He was one of the first four professors of the Hebrew University and the founder of its Department of Hygiene and Bacteriology that he headed till his death in 1944. Kligler is one of the pioneers who set up the foundations for research work in 'Eretz Israel' (Mandatory Palestine) in the fields of Bacteriology, Parasitology, Virology, Epidemiology, Nutrition and Public Health. He developed the medium 'Kligler Iron Agar' for the isolation and the identification of intestinal bacteria which is still in use.

Kostins represented his nation Latvia at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and has been training for more than 20 years at the Daugmale Wrestling Club in his native hometown Rīga, under his personal coach Andrei Trubetzkoi. Kostins qualified for the Latvian squad in the men's 96 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens by receiving a berth from the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. He received two straight losses and a score of two technical points in a preliminary pool match against Uzbekistan's Aleksey Cheglakov and Turkey's Mehmet Özal, who later picked up the bronze medal in the knockout stages, finishing seventeenth out of twenty-two wrestlers. In 2011, Kostins turned himself professional as a mixed martial arts fighter, and had competed in numerous global tournaments, where he claimed grand slam heavyweight titles and was ranked among 250 wrestlers under the same division. One of his sporting highlights came in a full throttle match against former UFC titleholder Paul Buentello, where Kostins could not produce a stellar fight against the American and consequently, recorded his first ever defeat in sporting career."

From 1942 to 1946 he was in the Soviet Army as a medical assistant; when he returned to Kiev he recommenced his musical studies, graduating from the Kiev Conservatory in 1951 in the class of Boris Lyatoshinsky. He had joined the Union of Soviet Composers in 1948, and at his graduation played his own Concert-Ballade for piano and orchestra. His popular song Kyieve Mii (My Kyiv) is regarded as the \"unofficial anthem of the Ukrainian capital\", and is cited on his memorial on the building where he lived (see picture). His other works include three symphonies, and an opera Yatranskiye Igri, which is unusually scored for a cappella choir and soloists."

During the mid-1920s, she worked for the United States Children's Bureau; her work there involved traveling the rural South and training midwives to use sterile delivery techniques and to register births. During a time when maternity homes for unwed mothers were for white women only, she opened her home to unwed mothers of color. Eventually, with the help of donations, she established a separate home for her work with these women, which still bears her name."

Fighting against Ukraine's Oleksiy Vakulenko in his knockout match, Chochua could not score two more points to push him off the mat with a score 12–14, before he faced a fifth-place battle with Cuba's Lázaro Rivas and then fell short from the ring by a technical superiority rule."

  "text" : "Frances Georgina Watts Higgins (September 1860 – 1948), usually known as \"Ina\", was a horticulturalist, landscape architect and feminist. She was the first female landscape architect in Victoria. Frances Georgina Watts Higgins (usually known as Ina), was the daughter of John and Anne (née Bournes) Higgins. She was born in County Cork, Ireland, in 1860. She arrived in Melbourne, from Ireland, on the ship Eurynome on 12 February 1870 with her mother and four siblings. Both Ina and her younger sister, Anna, attended the Presbyterian Ladies' College and the University of Melbourne. A brother, Henry Bournes Higgins, was a Justice of the High Court of Australia. In 1897, Charles Bogue Luffman, the enlightened director of Burnley Horticultural College in Melbourne, welcomed women into his institution as students, an event that had a profound effect on the subsequent development of landscape architecture. Ina Higgins enrolled at Burnley in 1899 and later established herself as Victoria's first professional woman landscape architect, while maintaining a prominent role as a political activist. She assisted with the planting schemes for two new model towns in the Murrumbidgee district at the invitation of the New South Wales Commission of Irrigation, designed notable private gardens and was a vocal advocate for women's participation in the profession. In 1891 a petition signed by approximately 30,000 women was presented to the Victorian parliament to urge the Government of the day to grant women the right to vote. Although that right was not won until 1908, the petition is an indication of the strength of the women's suffrage movement in Victoria. Ina Higgins signed the petition and, from 1894, was the honorary secretary of the United Council for Woman suffrage and sat on its executive committee from 1900. During the First World War, Ina Higgins, now in her fifties, was active in her profession of landscape gardening and also in political activity. In 1914, she was invited by the New South Wales Government Commission of Irrigation, to assist with the planting plans for the two new townships in the Murrumbidgee irrigation districts of New South Wales. In 1915 when a co-operative women's farm, The Women's Rural Industries Co. Ltd., was started at Mordialloc, Ina Higgins was involved. She was also a member of the Women's Political Association. From 1890 Ina lived at the family home, \"Killenna,\" Malvern. She never married and continued to live there until the time of her death on 26 October 1948."

  "text" : "Ioannis Theofanidis (Greek: Ιωάννης Θεοφανίδης) was a Greek Navy officer and scholar. After studies in the Hellenic Navy Academy, Theofanidis served during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and the Balkan Wars (where he was adjutant to the Greek fleet commander, Pavlos Kountouriotis), finally retiring as a Rear Admiral in 1923. Having taught history in the Navy Academy, Theofanidis dedicated himself to historical research thereafter, editing publishing the archives of his wife's great-great-grandfather, the hero of the Greek Revolution Theodoros Kolokotronis, studies on the history of the Greek Navy in the periods 1824–26 (Ο Αγών της Ανεξαρτησίας, Ιστορία του ελληνικού ναυτικού. Σεπτέμβριος 1824 - Απρίλιος 1826: Νεόκαστρον-Καφηρεύς-Αλεξάνδρεια-Μεσολόγγιον, 1932) and 1909–13 (Ιστορία του Ελληνικού Ναυτικού 1909-1913: μετ'εικόνων και χαρτών, 1923), on the downfall of Napoleon after the Battle of Waterloo (Η Πτώσις του Ναπολέοντος: η γαλλική Βουλή μετά το Βατερλώ-\"Βελερεφόντης\"-\"Νορθούμπερλαντ\"-Αγία Ελένη, 1933) and on his campaign in Syria against Sir Sidney Smith (Ναπολέων - Σερ Σίδνεϋ Σμιθ, 1929). In the 1920s he came across and became obsessed with the study of the Antikythera mechanism, selling off family property to finance his research into reconstructing a model of the device. He published a first set of his findings in 1934, but most of his work remained unpublished and unknown after his death. With his wife, Aikaterini Ioannidou, he had two children, a daughter Elli and a son, Iason, who also became a naval officer."

As all courtesans of her class, she had a main client, in her case Roberto Strozzi. According to Pierre Brantome, she was herself a client of one of her colleagues, Pandora, whom she paid for sexual services. A famous incident took place on a party, were Rocco Biancalana lost a bet to her after he had promised to make her blush, but in which she instead won the bet.

  "text" : "Ilie B. Moscovici (also known as Tovilie; November 28, 1885 – November 1, 1943) was a Romanian socialist militant and journalist, one of the noted leaders of the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR). A socialist since early youth and a party member since its creation in 1910, he returned from captivity in World War I to lead the PSDR from Bucharest, and involved himself in a violent clash with the Romanian authorities. He mediated between reformist and Bolshevik currents, and helped establish the Socialist Party of Romania (PS) as a fusion of both tendencies. Moscovici served as a PS representative in Chamber, but was deposed over his instigation of the 1920 general strike, then imprisoned. Although he voted against the creation of a Communist Party from the rump PS and criticized Comintern interference in Romanian affairs, he was again apprehended in 1921. Together with the communists, he appeared as a defendant in the Dealul Spirii Trial. Moscovici spent the 1920s and '30s on reconstructing the PSDR and enlarging its basis, sometimes together with, and sometimes against, the moderate socialist Constantin Titel Petrescu. He was the party's representative to the Labor and Socialist International, a participant in antifascist causes, and a publisher of Marxist literature. Seen as the Social Democratic doctrinaire, he continued to take stands against the Communist Party and the Soviet Union, cautioning against the formation of a \"popular front\". Persecuted by the far-right for his politics and his Jewish ethnicity, Moscovici was still active in the clandestine PSDR by the time of World War II. He died, after a long illness, before his party's involvement in the Coup of 1944. In later years, after the PSDR was absorbed by the Communist Party, Moscovici's contribution was censored out of socialist history. His work was carried on by his daughter, Mira Moscovici, who helped reestablish an independent PSDR in 1990, during the country's post-communist era. Moscovici's relatives include French social scientist Serge Moscovici and his son, the politician Pierre Moscovici."

  "text" : "Shehu Mustapha Idrissa Timta (1942 – May 30, 2014) was a Nigeria traditional leader who served as the 3rd Emir of Gwoza from October 1981 until his death in May 2014. He was killed in an attack by Boko Haram terrorists on May 30, 2014. Timta was born in 1942, the son of the second Emir of Gwoza, Idrisa Timta. He attended Muslim Elementary School, Gwoza, until 1948 and Senior Primary School in Bama, Nigeria, from 1952 to 1960. He then attended Provincial Secondary School (present-day Government College Maiduguri) from 1960 until 1964. He taught for a short time and then enrolled at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, where he studied sharia law. Timta began his career as an inspector of area courts for the former North-Eastern State judicial system. He was promoted to Principal Inspector of Area Courts, a position he held until he became emir in 1981. Timta was appointed the 3rd Emir of Gwoza, a local government area in present-day Borno State, in October 1981. Timta was elevated to second class emir status in 1987. In January 2014, Governor of Borno State Kashim Shettima further elevated Timta to first class traditional ruler status. On April 13, 2014, Timta condemned the Boko Haram terrorist organization, which is active in the Gwoza area and the rest of Borno State. He decried the group's insurgency, violence and the negative socio-economic impact that it had inflicted on Gwoza. In the speech, Timta said, \"our people have witnessed increased attacks with mass killings by the insurgents in the last four months. The attacks have crippled both social and economic lives in the entire area...It is sad to say that my people have been blocked from going to the market by the insurgents, who kill at will. Timta appealed to the Nigerian government to prevent further Boko Haram attacks. On May 30, 2014, Timta and two other traditional leaders were traveling to Gombe, Nigeria, for the funeral of the Emir of Gombe Shehu Abubakar, who had died from cancer on May 27. Timta's convoy was attacked by Boko Haram terrorists in an ambush which took place at 9 a.m. on Gombi-Garkida-Biu Road near Biu, Nigeria. Timta was killed in the attack, along with his driver and two policemen, who shielded the other emirs during the ambush. The two other emirs who were driving to the funeral with Timta - the Emir of Askira Abdullahi Ibn Muhammadu Askirama and the Emir of Uba Ali Ibn Ismaila Mamza II - barely escaped the attack. Timta, who was 72 years old, was survived by his centenarian mother, four wives, and twenty-eight children. The Gwoza Emirate Council in Borno State appointed his successor, Muhammad Timta, as the fourth Emir of Gwoza in June 2014, two weeks after the attack. He was presented with a letter of appointment from the Borno State government on June 13, 2014."

  "text" : "Ivan Kern (3 October 1898 - 26 June 1991) was a Slovene naval officer who led two Yugoslav torpedo boats to escape capture and join the British Royal Navy when the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia occurred in April 1941 during World War II. At the end of the war he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral by Josip Broz Tito. Before the outbreak of World War II he was a Kapetan bojnog broda (captain of battleships) and commanded a division of torpedo boats. On 16 April, during the invasion of Yugoslavia, he left the Bay of Kotor with the torpedo boats Durmitor and Kajmakčalan and joined the Royal Navy in Alexandria. When the Yugoslav government-in-exile was formed in London, he was appointed as head of the Department of the Navy in the Ministry of Transport. He was later involved in the negotiations for the transfer of the vessels of the Royal Yugoslav Navy to the Yugoslav Navy of Josip Broz Tito's Partisans. These talks were held on the island of Vis. Tito promoted him to Kontraadmiral (rear admiral) in 1945, and he retired from service on 22 December 1945."

  "text" : "Iring Fetscher (4 March 1922 – 19 July 2014) was a German academic, political scientist and researcher on Hegel and Marxism. Fetscher was born at Marbach am Neckar, and was brought up in Dresden. After World War II he studied at Tübingen and Paris, receiving a doctorate in 1950. He belatedly published his thesis Hegels Lehre vom Menschen in 1970. He habilitated in 1959 with a dissertation on the political philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. From 1963 to 1988 Fetscher was Professor of Political Science and Social Philosophy at the Goethe University Frankfurt. He is identified with the \"second generation\" of the Frankfurt School, along with Jürgen Habermas and Alfred Schmidt. Kołakowski, while taking Fetscher to be a distinguished historian of Marxism with a critical but positive attitude, does not see him as of the Frankfurt School more than notionally. In 1976, he published his own rather different version of the fairy tale The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids by the Brothers Grimm, known as a fairy tale called, Die Geiß und die sieben Wölflein (English version as \"The Goat and the Seven Young Wolves\"), which is part of the children's book Update on Rumpelstiltskin and other Fairy Tales by 43 Authors, which is compiled by Hans-Joachim Gelberg, illustrated by Willi Glasauer, and published by Beltz & Gelberg. In 1993, Iring Fetscher was honored with induction into the French Order of Academic Palms (Ordre des Palmes Académiques)."

  "text" : "Im Dae-won (Korean: 임 대원; born August 16, 1976 in Imsil, Jeollabuk-do) is a retired amateur South Korean Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's featherweight category. He produced a remarkable tally of three career medals, including a silver in the 55-kg division at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Créteil, France, and also finished seventh at the 2004 Summer Olympics, representing his nation South Korea. Having worked as a full-time employee for Samsung Sports, Im trained throughout his sporting career as a member of its wrestling team under head coach Ahn Han-bong. Im highlighted his sporting career at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Créteil, France, where he picked up a silver medal in the 55-kg division, losing 5–6 to three-time Olympic veteran Dariusz Jabłoński of Poland. Because of his unprecedented success, Im emerged as one of the top favorites to win a medal for the Olympic Games, and went on to grab another silver at the Asian Championships in Almaty, Kazakhstan by the following year. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Im qualified for the South Korean squad, as a 28-year-old, in the men's 55 kg class. Earlier in the process, he placed second behind Jablonski at the World Championships and guaranteed a spot on South Korea's Olympic wrestling team by obtaining a silver medal from the Asian Championships. He dominated the prelim pool by pulling into a 4–4 tie over Kazakhstan's Nurbakyt Tengizbayev, and dismantling another Olympic veteran Marian Sandu of Romania with a 3–6 verdict to secure him a spot for the next round. As he faced off against eventual Olympic silver medalist Geidar Mamedaliyev of Russia, Im could not hold him tightly to score enough points and lost the match 3–0, placing seventh in the final standings."

  "text" : "Ignaz Unterberger was an Italian and Austrian artist as a painter and printmaker, who was also a keen inventor. He was a member of a large dynasty of Tyrolian artists. Unterberger was probably born on 24 July 1748 in Cavalese, located in the County of Tyrol, today in Italy. His initial artistic instruction came from his uncle Franz Sebald Unterberger (1706-1776). Unterberger Senior taught his nephew the style of the Tyrol. This was High Baroque - famed for intricate church altarpieces, sculpture and frescoes. Artists working in Vienna and Salzburg found themselves training in Rome, including Ignaz's elder brother. Christoph Unterberger (1732-1798)'s influence as a member of the Accademia di San Luca provided Ignaz with access to a pivotal group of Italian artists when he arrived in Rome in 1769. His ability to capture the Italian style was such that his painting 'Maternal Love' was thought to have been Correggio's. Unterberger was a highly capable artist, with experience in creating frescoes, altarpiece paintings, bambocciata and marble work. The artist stated that he only painted for a livelihood, but printmaking was his real passion. Unterberger's printmaking is not particularly well-known, although some of his prints were included in the British Museum's 1994 exhibition and catalogue 'Printmaking in the Age of Goethe'. He did not engage in printmaking until he returned to Vienna from Rome in 1773, when he applied himself exclusively to the mezzotint. His inventions included an excavating machine for digging canals, a foot-pedal for the harp, and a machine for preparing mezzotint plates. Unterberger was never made a member of the Academy in Vienna, despite exhibiting there. Nevertheless his work was highly regarded, and the Imperial Chancellor Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg was a patron. His painting Hebe (1795) was a sensation for its lighting effects, and bought by Emperor Francis II for a large amount. He was also made a Royal and Imperial Court Painter. Unfortunately, he only benefited from this role for two years before heart failure lead to his death on 4 December 1797, leaving a widow and nine children."

Some of these have been implemented by municipal governments, particularly in Rome."

  "text" : "Maria Isabella Vincentini (born in 1954) is an Italian poet, essayist and literary critic. She graduated in Humanities at La Sapienza University in Rome, where she also gained a post-graduate degree in modern philology. The focus of her dissertation was Nietzsche’s philological writings and the classical world of Greek tragedy. Topics which are revisited both in her essays and in her poetry, which is influenced by contemporary Greek poetry, especially by that of Odisseas Elitis and Giorgos Seferis, both of which she has dealt with extensively in her criticism.Her essays focus on the debate on the theory of literature between hermeneutics, deconstruction and postmodernism (Blanchot, Deleuze, Foucault, Lyotard, Todorov, de Man and Frye) and aim to provide a thematic reading of twentieth-century poetry (Mallarmé, Gabriele D’Annunzio, Ungaretti, Quasimodo, Montale, Luzi and Rosselli). She has published anthologies of Italian poets who came to light after the so-called Neoavanguardia, a movement which dominated the nineteen-sixties, as well as essays, monographs and interviews with them. She has also published two collections of poems: Le ore e i giorni (The Hours and the Days) and Diario di bordo (Logbook). She has worked on cultural programmes for RAI (the Italian state broadcasting company) and in 1999 she founded with the philosopher Mario Perniola and a group of Italian and international intellectuals the magazine Agalma of whose editorial committee she is still a member."

  "text" : "Ishmael ben Fabus  also known as Ishmael ben Phiabi (Hebrew: ישמעאל בן פיאבי) was a High Priest of Israel in the 1st century. He was High Priest of Israel from 15 CE to 16 CE and then again from 58 CE to 62 CE. He was appointed as High Priest by the Roman governor, Valerius Gratus, to replace the biblical Annas, and latter for a second term by Herod Agrippa II. He appears to have been a very unpopular High Priest. It is said of him that he was \"the handsomest man of his time, whose effeminate love of luxury was the scandal of the age\" Although his tenure as high priest (Kohen Gadol) coincides with the life of Jesus of Nazareth he does not appear in New Testament. Despite being absent from the bible, however, he is mentioned in the story Ben-Hur and Josephus. His priesthood coincided with a turbulent time in Jewish politics, with the role of high priest being contended for between the House of Boethus supported by Herod, the House of Annas supported by the governor, Quirinius and the House of Fabus."
