In 1968, he opened one of the first three racially integrated law firms in the south, first known as Walker and Chachkin. Between 1965 and now, Walker has personally been involved in most of the reported cases which involve racial discrimination in the state of Arkansas. Many of them are landmark having created new law and opened doors to school houses and work places throughout the state of Arkansas and surrounding states. One case has continued to take his time since 1965, the Little Rock school case started by the late Wiley Branton and LDF general counsel/later Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Many of Walker’s early cases involved classes of people discriminated against due to their race in mega corporate environments. A recent case of Walker’s was the only nationwide racial discrimination case ever successfully prosecuted against Wal-Mart. It involved a class of African American truck drivers."

  "text" : "Juan Carlos Bonnin (born February 2, 1968 in Okinawa, Japan) was a popular Filipino matinee idol in the 1980s. He is best remembered for his roles in the movies Bagets, Ninja Kids, and Kamagong (with Lito Lapid). In fact, Bagets created a cult following among young Filipino movie fans, and has had a strong influence among the modern Filipino youth that still pervades up to this day. Bonnin comes from a family of well-known showbiz personalities. His uncle, Bernard Bonnin married to Elvira González, were former actors. His cousins are former beauty queen/actress Charlene González (now married to actor Aga Muhlach) and former actor Richard Bonnin. He has now quit acting and has become a pastor of Hope for the World Christian Church and Missions in America living with his family."

  "text" : "Julius Raith (March 29, 1819 - April 11, 1862) was a German-American military officer who served in the American Civil War and the Mexican-American War. He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. Raith came in the United States in 1836 with his family, settling in St. Clair County, Illinois. During the Mexican-American War, he led a company of 2nd Illinois Volunteers. When the Civil War broke out, he helped Gustave Koerner organize a German regiment. During the Battle of Shiloh, he led a brigade in General McClernand's division composed of his own regiment, the 43rd Illinois along with the 17th Illinois, the 29th Illinois, and the 49th Illinois. The actual commanding officer was Colonel Leonard Fulton Ross who was absent, leaving Colonel James S. Reardon in charge; however, Reardon was ill. Raith was wounded by a minie ball in the leg above the knee and laid in the battlefield for 24 hours. He died of tetanus from his injuries."

  "text" : "Joel Shalom Feldman (born 14 June 1949, Ottawa) is a Canadian mathematical physicist and mathematician. Feldman studied mathematics and physics at the University of Toronto with bachelor's degree in 1970 and at Harvard University with master's degree in 1971 and with PhD in 1974 under Arthur Jaffe with thesis The field theory in a finite volume. In 1974–1975 he did research at Harvard on constructive quantum field theory and was from 1975 to 1977 a Moore Instructor at MIT. At the University of British Columbia he became in 1977 an assistant professor, in 1982 an associate professor, and in 1987 a professor. Feldman received in 1996 the John L. Synge Award, in 2007 the CRM-Fields-PIMS Prize, in 2007 the CAP-CRM Prize, and in 2004 the Jeffery-Williams Prize. From 1989 to 1991 he was a Killam Fellow and he was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow. In 2007 he was a Fellow at the Fields Institute. Feldman works on constructive quantum field theory (with some work in collaboration with Vincent Rivasseau, Konrad Osterwalder, and Manfred Salmhofer). He also does research on the mathematical theory of Fermi liquids (including Fermi surfaces, superconducting transitions, and explicit construction of Fermi fluids in two dimensions at the zero temperature limit in a long series of articles with Knörrer and Trubowitz) and Bose fluids in quantum many-body theory. With Horst Knörrer and Eugene Trubowitz, Feldman has worked on Riemann surfaces of infinite genus. With Gunther Uhlmann he has written a book on inverse problems. Feldman became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1990. In 1990 in Kyoto he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians with lecture Introduction to constructive quantum field theory. He was an invited speaker in 2003 in Lisbon at the 14th ICMP (Construction of a 2-dimensional Fermi Liquid, from work with Knörrer and Trubowitz). Feldman in 1997 in Brisbane at the 12th ICMP delivered a plenary address (Renormalization of the Fermi surface, from work with Salmhofer and Trubowitz). From 2005 to 2010 Feldman was editor of the Journal of Mathematical Physics. Since 1999 he is a co-editor of the Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincaré. Feldman's doctoral students include Gordon Slade."

  "text" : "John Barnes (born Irvine circa 1960) is a sports commentator working for BBC Scotland. He is one of the most respected sports broadcasters in Scotland working on both television and radio mainly as a football commentator on the flagship programmes Sportscene and Sportsound. Joined the BBC in 1993 after previously having worked in broadcasting for Radio Clyde, STV, West Sound Radio and BT Supercall Sport. Barnes was also a writer for the Scottish Daily Express before joining the BBC. Commentated for the BBC at the 1998 World Cup Finals in France - the last time Scotland were at the finals of a major tournament.He was the last Scot to provide radio commentary on a Scottish club in a European final - Uefa Cup Final 2008: Zenit St Petersburg v Glasgow Rangers. Barnes was famously assaulted during a television interview, by the then chairman of Dundee United, Jim McLean, at Tannadice following a match with Hearts in October 2000. McLean resigned following the incident before the football authorities could deal with him. Ex players Gordon Smith, Willie Miller, Billy Dodds and Craig Paterson regularly join Barnes as co-commentator. Barnes has a close association with Kilmarnock Football Club having played with the Ayrshire club's youth team. He also played for the successful Ayrshire Junior football club Auchinleck Talbot. On March 31, 2014 The Evening Times ranked Barnes as the ninth greatest Scottish football commentator."

She was born in Toodyay on 28 February 1851, the second of four children of Charles and Jane Mary (née Cameron) Glass, and married Charles Frederick Adams in 1868. The Adams originally established a farm at Yarragin, then in 1875 they moved to Mangowine, near Nungarin – the furthermost east of any settler at that time – where they built the Mangowine Homestead. In 1887 Adams commenced keeping meteorological records, a task she continued until her death in 1934. With the discovery of gold at Yilgarn in 1888, Charles built an inn at the homestead, which Jane ran until Mangowine was bypassed by the rail line from Northam to Southern Cross. They closed the inn in 1893. Charles died in 1895, and Jane continued to run the farm providing fresh produce for travellers and railway workers. She successfully tendered for the mail run in 1896, with their son Charles as the mail man. In early 1900s more settlers took up farming in the region; many of these people were inexperienced in farming the tough conditions, and they turned to Adams for help and advice. The town of Nungarin was established in 1910. In 1929 Adams was the guest of honour for the opening of the Barbalin Water Scheme. Adams died on 9 November 1934 at Mangowine, and was buried in the Nungarin Cemetery. In 1935 a memorial was erected in her memory. Adams was inducted into the Royal Agricultural Society of Western Australia's \"Agricultural Hall of Fame\" in 2003."

Occasionally she played more substantial parts as in Hard Steel and They Flew Alone (both 1942). Post-Second World War, she moved into television working as both a producer and director of television films and episodes of television series. In 1959 she was one of the winners at the Society of Film and Television Arts Television Awards. In 1964 she directed A Midsummer Night's Dream for ITV's Play of the Week. The same year she directed four Noël Coward adaptations for A Choice of Coward. Other work included directing episodes of Upstairs, Downstairs and Armchair Theatre."

In a pun on his name, Voltaire described him as ‘ni Homère, ni joli, ni fleuri' ( = neither Homer, nor pretty, nor flowery, a sarcastic comment on his apparently dreary oratory). In one of his private letters, Voltaire described him as a ‘little black balloon puffed up with stinking vapours’"

As such, he negotiated improvements for working conditions and benefits for teachers. He was first elected to the National Parliament of Solomon Islands in a by-election in the Ngella constituency on 27 February 2013. The by-election followed Liberal MP Mark Kemakeza's forced resignation from Parliament upon being convicted and gaoled for embezzlement. Hatimoana was elected easily, seeing off a field of nine other candidates and obtaining more than twice as many votes as his closest competitor. He sat on the benches of the Opposition to Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo's government. Hatimoana was an MP for less than fourteen months. On 17 April 2014 (a day of parliamentary sitting), he was taken suddenly ill with severe pneumonia, and died in hospital the following day. No by-election was needed to replace him, as the next general election was only a few months away."

  "text" : "John Wyse (died after 1499) was an Irish judge who held office as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. He was born in Waterford. He was a member of the long-established Wyse family of St John's Manor, which settled in the city around 1169, at the time of the Norman conquest of Ireland. He was the son of Maurice Wyse, who served twice Mayor of Waterford, from whom he inherited substantial estates sometime after 1495. He married a daughter of Henry Sherlock, and was the father of Sir William Wyse, a prominent Irish statesman in the reign of Henry VIII. Probably his best known descendant was Sir Thomas Wyse, the politician, diplomat and nephew by marriage of Napoleon. In 1482 he received a special licence to leave Ireland in order to study law at the Inns of Court in London- Ireland had no law school at the time, and it was considered desirable that Irish lawyers who hoped to achieve judicial office should receive legal training in this way. He was Chief Baron from 1492 to 1494, and was by statute  appointed special justice for the counties of Waterford and Kilkenny in 1493, and again in 1499. Our most personal glimpse of him is in 1495, when he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Munster to negotiate with Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond, but was taken unawares by the invasion of the pretender Perkin Warbeck, who with Desmond's support besieged Waterford. Wyse was forced to flee;  he subsequently put in a claim to the Treasury for the loss of two horses, and received compensation."

  "text" : "James Ward was born on November 17, 1851 at Gavin’s Buildings, Shankill Road, Belfast. He was the son of James Ward a house painter and decorative artist. Ward studied at the Belfast Government School of Art, and in 1872 he was awarded a scholarship to the National Art Training School, South Kensington, London. While there, he worked with Sir Edward Poynter who recommended him as an assistant to Sir Frederic Leighton. He assisted Leighton on the two vast murals Peace and War at the Museum of Ornamental Art in London (subsequently South Kensington Museum and now the Victoria and Albert Museum). He was Leighton's sole assistant until 1887, and wrote an account of the two frescoes for the Magazine of Art. He subsequently worked in art education, and was appointed head of Macclesfield School of Art in 1888. In 1907 he returned to Ireland (residing at 88 Marlborough Road, Dublin) as headmaster of the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art (now National College of Art and Design). His innovations there included introducing new classes of painting in spirit fresco and wood carving. He held that post until he retired in 1918. Over his career, he exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, Belfast Art Society and the Royal Hibernian Academy, and his designs won prizes at the 1878 Paris Exposition and the 1884 London Health Exhibition. Ward is best known in Ireland for the mural paintings in the rotunda of Dublin’s City Hall, undertaken on behalf of Dublin Corporation. The twelve frescoes consist of eight scenes from the early history of Dublin, and four heraldic panels representing the four provinces of Ireland. They were commenced in 1914 and completed in 1918. Ward was assisted by some of his students in the work, including Harry Clarke and Seán Keating. On retirement, James Ward went first to England, and then to the home of his daughter in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He died there on 18 May 1924."

  "text" : "John Prophet (died c. 1399), of Hereford, was a medieval merchant and mayor, whose real identity is uncertain. John Prophet was a clothier in Hereford. Circa 1377 he was one of twenty-five citizens appointed by Richard II as Custodians of the city with full powers as Commissioners of Array to marshall the town's defences. From 1385 onwards he was regularly employed to witness deeds. He was entitled to amortize messuages by royal licence to sponsor a chapel chantry for the Holy Rood in All Saints Church in the centre of the city to pray for the souls of their ancestors. What is confusng is that the King's Secretary was also Master John Prophet, Dean of Hereford, so that on his appointment there arose a conflict of interest with the civic offices of the town's alnagers. This may explain the dean's mugging in church lane, and possibly Master Prophet's decision to seek preferment elsewhere. Permission had to be obtained both from the king and the bishop, which was not completed until June 1391. It seems that in 1391 he travelled to the west midlands with seven other deputies on behalf of the chief alnager of England, William Hervy, and was holding the office of an alnager when returned a burgess Member of the Parliament of England for Hereford in 1391. Then he was made Mayor of Hereford for 1392–93. There is apparently a brass monumental inscription oveer a south transept door reading \"here lies John Prophet, once a Mayor of Hereford\". Although it is clear that he was probably different man from the Dean, it is uncertain if he was ever made mayor in 1391, but was an MP."

The Viking ice skate proved to be very popular, and by 1972 every speed skating world record was skated on Viking ice skates. Viking was the first company to produce the clap skate on a large scale. Due to his significant influence on speed skating in the Netherlands, speed skaters from later generations spoke fondly of Havekotte and used to call him 'Oom Jaap' ('Uncle Jaap'). Havekotte died on 23 April 2014 at the age of 102."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Josephine Brown (June 12, 1839 – January 16, 1874) was the daughter and biographer of escaped African-American slave William Wells Brown and his first wife Elizabeth Schooner. Josephine's account, Biography of an American Bondman, by His Daughter, was published in Boston by R. F. Wallcut in 1856. It was long believed to be the first biography written by an African American woman, but is now known to have been predated by Susan Paul's Memoir of James Jackson, the attentive and obedient scholar (1835). Biography of an American Bondman draws heavily on and generally parallels William Wells Brown's own account of his life, Narrative of William W. Brown, A Fugitive Slave (1847). However, Josephine was forthcoming about details of abuse and mistreatment which Wells Brown's account does not include, and openly addressed the problems of mulatto slaves. She also expands the account to include Brown's life in Europe."

Shoctor was born in Edmonton, Alberta in 1922, the son of a Jewish father, and grew up in the Boyle Street neighbourhood. He first became involved in the theatre industry in his hometown, producing, writing, directing and acting with the Edmonton Little Theatre, Edmonton Light Opera, and entertaining World War II troops. After attending Victoria Composite High School, he attended law school at the University of Alberta and was called to the Alberta bar in 1948. In the 1960s, he worked in New York where he produced theatre with Norman Twain. In Edmonton in 1965, he purchased the former Salvation Army Citadel building along with friends James L. Martin, Ralph B. MacMillan, and Sandy Mactaggart. The Citadel Theatre was founded on October 12, 1965 with its first opening night on November 10, 1965. The theatre's first production to be performed was Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. Shoctor was also involved with founding of the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, and also served as secretary-manager from 1954 to 1956. He was also governor of the National Theatre School of Canada in Montreal. A real estate developer, he worked on the planning of neighbourhoods near Rio Terrace, Edmonton, and was also a proponent of revitalization of Downtown Edmonton. Shoctor was made an officer of the Order of Canada in 1986. He received the Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Voluntarism in the Performing Arts in 1998 and the Alberta Order of Excellence in 1990. He is a member of the Edmonton Cultural Hall of Fame, inducted as a builder in 1987, and a recipient of an honorary doctor of laws from his alma mater, the University of Alberta, in 1981.

Between 1916 and 1918, during the First World War, he was a Second Secretary in the British Diplomatic Service. He later moved to the British Virgin Islands in the 1930s on the advice of his doctors to seek a warmer climate. He purchased an estate of approximately 230 acres on Peter Island at Little Harbour and established a small tobacco plantation. Subsequently he was elected as a member of First Legislative Council following the reintroduction of democracy in 1950. Although many of Brudenell-Bruce's family had enjoyed long and successful political careers in the United Kingdom, he did not stand in the subsequent general election. However he was appointed to complete the term of Edwin H. Leonard in the 3rd District when Leonard was unable to continue in 1955, and he served the remainder of the term. He was the first, and to date the only, white person to be elected to the British Virgin Islands legislature since the restoration of democracy in 1950."

  "text" : "James Gilchrist Lawson (1874–1946) was a prolific British Christian author and compiler. Most notably, he compiled biographical sketches into Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians (1911), which is a landmark text in Pentecostal and Charismatic history. This book draws broadly from Christian history and the Wesleyan holiness movement to include many post-conversion experiences with the Holy Spirit, which Lawson believed to be the baptism of the Holy Spirit. In this way, it connects the modern Pentecostal movement, which began in 1900, to the much larger stream of Christian theology and history. Biographical sketches include Girolamo Savonarola, Fenelon, Madame Guyon, John Wesley, Charles Finney, William Booth, and many others. Author and professor Dallas Willard wrote that Deeper Experiences is ″the one book other than the Bible that has most influenced me.″ Lawson was editor of The Marked Reference Bible, which was an expansion on The Christian Worker's New Testament which he had published in 1924. The Marked Reference Bible includes a chain-reference and a color-coding system. The four colors represent the primary topics of salvation (red), the Holy Spirit (green), temporal blessings (brown), and prophetic subjects (blue). This Bible comes highly recommended by Winkie Pratney as a reference for biblical theology. The Bible allows you to see not only where a topic or subtopic is mentioned, but how many times, as a guide to that topic's importance to the biblical text. Lawson was also a prolific compiler of quotes and stories. His compilations include Greatest Thoughts About the Bible, Greatest Thoughts About Jesus Christ,Greatest Thoughts About God, The World’s Best Humorous Anecdotes (1923), The World’s Best Conundrums and Riddles of all Ages (1924), The World's Best Epigrams (1924), and The Best Loved Religious Poems. In 1941, Lawson published a compilation of biographical sketches called Famous Missionaries. James Lawson says of himself in the introduction to Greatest Thoughts About God, ″For the greater part of his life the compiler of this volume has been collecting the greatest thoughts of the greatest thinkers on the greatest themes. During the years the compiler has engaged in evangelistic work in the United States and Great Britain, he was able to consult the best books in the best libraries of America and Britain and to glean the best thoughts from them. While engaged in journalistic work, for five years, for the leading religious papers, in London, England, he was brought in contact with most of the religious leaders of the world and garnered the best thoughts from them. Through his connection with the religious publishing business during the last ten years, he has been able to collect the best thoughts from all the leading religious papers. Owing to the exceptional privileges which have been given to him by the providence of God, the compiler of this volume is able to give to the world the very cream of religious thoughts concerning God.″"

The son of Jean Orillat and Marie Dupuy, he was born in Barbezieux and came to Canada at a young age. He was involved in the fur trade in the Michilimackinac and La Baye areas and also operated a shop in Montreal. Orillat also lent money and dealt in real estate, lumber and wheat. He operated in partnership with various other merchants, including Pierre Foretier and Jean-Gabriel Cerré. After the invasion of Quebec in September 1775 by the Americans, some parishes in the Richilieu valley joined the Americans. Orillat was sent by Governor Carleton with an offer of amnesty, but was taken prisoner and brought to Connecticut. He was able to escape in late December of that year and had resumed business by September of the following year. He was married twice, both times in Montreal: first to Marie-Amable Filiau, dit Dubois in 1761 and then to Thérèse-Amable Viger in 1767. Orillat died in Montreal. After his death, his estate was left to his daughter Luce-Amable. Her husband Alexis Réaume took over the operation of the business interests but, by 1786, the firm of Rashleigh and Company in London had taken over the operation of the estate."

Between 1923 and 1930 he was married to Colleen Moore, one of the highest-paid and most popular stars of the silent era. McCormick was initially unconvinced by the development of sound films and vetoed Moore appearing in them. He changed his mind in 1929 and placed Moore in her first talkie Smiling Irish Eyes which was not a great success. Their marriage was under increasing strain and in 1930 the couple divorced. His relationship with Moore is believed to be the inspiration for the film What Price Hollywood? (1932)."

  "text" : "John Cheever Goodwin (1850 – December 1912) was an American musical theatre librettist, lyricist and producer. Goodwin was born in Boston and graduated from Harvard University. He began a career in journalism before turning to writing for the stage. He often worked with composers Edward E. Rice and Woolson Morse. Goodwin was one of the earliest American writers dedicated to musical theatre librettos and lyrics. His first successful libretto was Evangeline in 1874, and his last new work was produced in 1903. Goodwin's works included a much-revived musical adaptation, or musical burlesque, of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Evangeline called Evangeline; or, The Belle of Acadia (1874), composed by Rice; The Corsair (1887), with music by Rice; Little Pig Went to Market (1890), with music by Gustave Kerker; The Merry Monarch, an English-language adaptation of L'étoile, with music by Morse (1890); a popular and well-revived piece, Wang (1891), with music by Morse, starring De Wolf Hopper; Panjandrum (1893), with music by Morse, written for and produced by Hopper's company; The Devil's Deputy (1894), music by Edward Jakobowski; A Daughter of the Revolution (1895), with music by Ludwig Engländer; Lost, Strayed or Stolen (1896), with music by Morse; 'Round New York in 80 Minutes (1899–1900), with music by Rice and John J. Braham; The Cadet Girl (1900), with music by Ludwig Engländer; The Monks of Malabar (1900), composed by Engländer; The Rogers Brothers in Central Park (1900–01), with music by Maurice Levi; The Sleeping Beauty and the Beast (1901–02), with music by Frederick Solomon; and Mr. Bluebeard (1903), with music by Solomon. Of Lost, Strayed or Stolen, a critic commented: \"Cheever Goodwin, clever at adaptation, at times a most dexterous manipulator in stagecraft, has been singularly successful in this latest venture. Starting of a delightfully humorous set of complications, woven logically together, he has made an honest translation and obtained a genuinely absurd farce which he carries through four acts, sustaining the interest to the end.\""

After the American Civil War, he lived for a time with his family in LaVilla, Florida, helping develop the new town. In 1870 he was one of numerous Southern black migrants to Boston, Massachusetts, which had a thriving black community and strong abolitionist history. He later joined the Republican Party that was founded by abolitionists, and Chappelle was elected to two terms in the Massachusetts state legislature, serving 1883-1886. Julius Caesar Chappelle was also the first African-American to serve on the Massachusetts State Senate Committee where he served three terms. Chappelle was active in supporting civil rights, trying to reduce discrimination, and consumer affairs. His speeches were frequently covered by newspapers. Throughout his life and political career, he held secondary supervisory government positions in maintenance, such as at the United States Post Office and US Boston Custom House. Although Julius Caesar Chappelle may have graced the same pages in newspapers as Frederick Douglass, Chappelle is not as well-known because he is not known to have left much of a literary footprint such as writing manuscripts or for pamphlets."

He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Wiltshire in 1420. John Rous was the younger son of John Rous of Imber, Wiltshire and Isolda FitzWarin of Great Chalfield, Wiltshire. When his father died in 1413, most of the property passed to his elder brother, William, but John inherited the manors of Baynton and Leigh (both in Wiltshire). He served in the retinue of Sir Walter Hungerford at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. In 1419 he was identified by the J.P.s for Wiltshire as one of the \"12 men-at-arms considered best able for military duties.\" In 1420 he was elected a Member of Parliament for Wiltshire, probably due to the influence of Walter Hungerford. He had no prior experience in local administration, and was not appointed to carry out any duties on behalf of the Crown. It has been suggested that he was a promoter of Lollardism and heresy, and in 1428 he was accused of inciting the people of Edington not to pay the local vicar the customary offerings at marriages, burials and baptisms, but in 1444 Rous gave his manor of Baynton to the monastery of Bonhommes at Edington (Edington Priory). As recounted in the Tropenell Cartulary, in 1431 he assisted his brother William in defending Great Chalfield Manor against the claims of the Beverleys. Thomas Tropenell subsequently acquired the manor, and built the manor house still standing there. He was married twice, first, before 1439 to Joan, sister of Robert Ashley (himself another Member of Parliament), and second to Anne Gawen. He had no legitimate offspring but, according to Tropenell, had one illegitimate son, John, son of Joan Perot, of Cowliston (Coulston, Wiltshire). He died some time between 1451 and 1454, and is buried, next to his first wife, in Edington Priory."

After graduating in 1892, he remained at the university to work as a Fellow until 1895, when he was awarded his Ph.D. and became an academic at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He left MIT in 1904 to become the first Professor of Chemistry at the newly formed Simmons College, before returning to take up the position of Professor of Organic Chemistry and, after its creation in 1926, the first Director of MIT's Research Laboratory of Organic Chemistry. Outside of his work as an academic, Norris served as President of the American Chemical Society from 1925 to 1926 and as Vice-President of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry from 1925 to 1928. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts on August 4, 1940. The James Flack Norris Award is named in his honour."

She started out at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, being one of only five women in her class. In 1987, she began working for Johns Hopkins Hospital, where she was asked if she'd like to work for their new clinic made to help women with HIV. Her decision to take the job helped establish the clinic as a vital resource for the care needed for women with HIV and AIDS, being one of the first hospitals to use peer counseling. In her lifetime so far, Jean Anderson has written over 75 articles on women with HIV, as well as the book The Manual for the Clinical Care for Women With HIV. Her efforts have garnered her international recognition, as well as four teaching awards, a membership at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of HIV Medicine. Today, she continues to serve as a director at Johns Hopkins HIV Women's Health Program."

A writer of \"classic\" poetry focused primarily on religion and family life, she modeled her life and writings after Elizabeth Singer Rowe. Turrell's contemporaries were Francis Knapp, Benjamin Colman, Roger Wolcott, Mather Byles, and Rev. John Adams. Turell died at the age of 27. Her letters, diary extracts, short religious essays and pious verse were collected in a pamphlet and published by her husband immediately after her death in 1735, as Reliquiate Turellae et Lachrymae Paternal, and reprinted in 1741 as Memoirs of the Life and Death of the Pious and Ingenious Mrs. Jane Turell."

He was a close friend of the politician John A. Costello and also of Liam Cosgrave who also served as Taoiseach. While teaching in London he was friendly with public figures such as George Bernard Shaw and Lady Laverly. He became friends with member of the family of Jackie Kennedy in the 1920s. He befriended Jacqueline Bouvier, as she then was, in 1950 when she visited Ireland with her step- brother, Father Leonard and Mrs. Kennedy maintained a regular correspondence until his death, and in 1955 Fr. Leonard invited Senator Kennedy to address the students at All Hallows while he was on a trip to Ireland. Jackie asked Fr. Leonard to baptise her son; however he was unable to do so owing to ill health. By an odd coincidence, Father Oscar Huber, the priest who administered the last rites of the Catholic Church to President Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963, was also a member of the Vincentian order. Father Leonard died in 1964 aged 87. Flowers from Jackie Kennedy were sent to his funeral in All Hallows. A number of letters from Jackie Kennedy to Fr. Leonard were put up for sale at an auction scheduled for June 2014. However the auction was cancelled on May 21 by All Hallows in a statement which indicated the college were exploring ways with the Kennedy family of curating the letters. Some letters from Fr Leonard to the former first lady are stored in the Kennedy archive in Boston."

  "text" : "Joe Brooks (Joseph White Brooks) 1901–1972 was an American Fly Fisherman and popular writer about the sport of fly fishing during the mid-20th century. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1901 and died in Rochester, Minnesota in 1972. He wrote for the leading fishing and outdoor magazines of the day and was the outdoor editor for The Baltimore Sun. He also wrote ten books about fly fishing, several of which are still considered leading authorities on the subject. He is listed by a leading online fly fishing publication, Fly Fishing Frenzy, as one of the 10 most influential fishermen ever. And the IGFA and others said he did more to popularize and expand fly fishing than any other individual. Brooks was born into a family that owned a successful insurance business. Joe worked in the business during his early life but soon realized he did not enjoy the business world and decided to become a professional fly fisherman and writer, the two passions he enjoyed most. He first began to write for small local Maryland sporting and community publications. But as his popularity gained he started writing for national publications like Field and Stream, The Fisherman, True Fishing Annual, Fishing Waters of the World, Ashaway Sportsman, and The Saltwater Sportsman. It was not long after this that he was hired by The Baltimore Sun as their outdoor editor. In 1953 he began writing for Outdoor Life, one of the most prestigious sporting magazines then and continuing today, and in 1968 he became the publication's fishing editor. Joe Brooks was a mentor and friend of one of the top fly fishermen alive today, Lefty Kreh. Kreh credits Brooks for introducing him to fly fishing, encouraging him to start writing about the sport and getting him one of his first jobs in the fishing industry. The job was with the Miami Herald running their Metropolitan Miami South Florida Fishing Tournament. Joe Brooks pioneered fly fishing for species that previously were thought impossible to catch with a fly. He is also one of the first to pioneer “adventure fly fishing” by traveling to remote places around the world that had never been fly fished before. In 1964, Curt Gowdy of ABC Sports produced a segment about fly fishing on ABC's Wide World of Sports featuring Joe Brooks. The two fly fished in the Argentinean Patagonia and the segment was so popular that a spinoff show was created to focus on outdoor sports such as hunting and fishing. The show was called The American_Sportsman and the first show aired on January 31, 1965. The show ran for over 20 years and was one of the most popular shows on Sunday afternoon television often beating out other major sports programming carried in the same time slot. Joe Brooks was a regular on the show over the following years. Joe Brooks taught many celebrities to fly fish and became lasting friends with them, including Bing Crosby, Ted Williams and Jack Nicklaus. Joe Brooks died of a heart attack on September 20, 1972 in Rochester, Minnesota. He is buried in Paradise Valley near Livingston, Montana, one of his favorite places to fish."

  "text" : "Jack Eldred Greenwood (born February 5, 1926 in Steele City, Nebraska-January 9, 2015 Aurora, Colorado) was an American track and field athlete. He is the former world record holder in the 400 metres hurdles in the masters age divisions M45, M50, M55, M60 and M65. His hurdle records were so advanced, the shortest any of them lasted was almost ten years, all but one broken by the same athlete, German Guido Müller. He had a similar record over the short hurdles. He also had his time at the top of the M50 and M60 400 meters and ten years at the top of the M65 200 meters (plus the M50 record). Two of his marks survive to this day as American records. Jack went to Argentine High School in Kansas City, Kansas where he was the Kansas state high hurdles champion before joining the Army in 1945. His son Riley MacGregor Greenwood would follow in his father's footsteps winning the same race in 1977 for Medicine Lodge High School. Following two years in the Army, Greenwood ran for the University of Kansas, where he was a five time conference champion in hurdles, primarily the low hurdles. Professionally, he was president and manager of the Barber County Savings and Loan Association of Medicine Lodge, Kansas. He also served on the local city council and school board. But he remained active in sports. In the formative years of Masters Athletics, Greenwood was part of the USMITT tour of Europe, which drew together the two most active continents. He was a winner at the first 1975 World Association of Veteran Athletes Championships, and continue to win until arthritis forced his competitive retirement in 1991. Greenwood died on January 9, 2015 after several health complications. Before his death, Greenwood resided in Aurora, Colorado with his wife Nancy, who is a retired art teacher, and his youngest son Jack. Greenwood's other son, Riley, resides in Valley Center, Kansas as a High School science teacher, with his wife, Diane, who owns a home daycare, and his son Jack, who is named after his grandfather. \"He’s simply one of the greatest age-group athletes in history.\"— Ken Stone, Masterstrack.com In 1997, he was in the second class selected to the USATF Masters Hall of Fame."

On April 6, 2013, at the annual Nebraska spring game, Hoffman at age 7 entered the game during the fourth quarter and ran for a 69 yards (63 m) touchdown that received national and international attention. He subsequently met with President Barack Obama, received a Best Moment ESPY Award for 2013, and the United States Senate approved a motion recognizing his role in raising awareness of pediatric brain cancer. The Team Jack Foundation was formed by his parents, Andy and Bri Hoffman, to raise money for pediatric brain research."

  "text" : "James Francis Coleman (June 2, 1918 – May 13, 2014), nicknamed \"Skeets\", was an American military fighter and test pilot. Born in Chicago, Illinois, Coleman joined the United States Marine Corps in 1941. During the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, he was a fighter pilot flying dive bombing missions. After the war, he received an aeronautical engineering degree from UCLA. From 1948 to 1950, he oversaw the operation of the now-defunct Del Mar Airport in San Diego, California. He would go on to work in sales and marketing for aviation companies, such as North American Aviation and Fairchild Aircraft. In 1951, Convair, an airplane manufacturer, was one of two companies contracted by the U.S. Navy to construct and test a vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) fighter. Convair created the tail-sitter XFY Pogo. Coleman, a Marine reservist and Convair employee, was chosen to be its test pilot when it was ready in 1954. Although the Pogo's liftoffs and transitions went smoothly, Coleman and other pilots had difficulty landing it, which had to be done visually from the cockpit. The Pogo project would prove to be unwieldy and was discontinued. About the project, Coleman stated, \"It was a developmental power plant, it was a developmental airplane, a developmental concept. It's pretty hard to tie all of those together without having a lot of risk\". For being the first pilot to successfully maneuver a VTOL fighter, Coleman was awarded the Harmon Trophy in 1954. In 2014, Coleman died of natural causes at an assisted-living facility in Oceanside, California. He was 95. He was survived by three children."

  "text" : "Joseph N. Ermolieff (1889–1962) was a Russian-born film producer. Ermolieff was a prominent figure in early Russian cinema during the Imperial era. He fled to France following the Russian Revolution and became an established procuder there. As well as Paris he also worked at the Emelka Studios in Munich. In 1936 he enjoyed a major international success with The Czar's Courier, and he moved to the United States the following year planning to remake the film in English. He settled in America and became a citizen in 1942, but struggled to establish himself in Hollywood despite producing occasional films such as Outpost in Morocco (1949) and Fort Algiers (1953). In 1944 he produced a Mexican version of Michael Strogoff (1944)."

In 1858 he sailed for Australia in the ship Royal Charter; his brothers having established a business — Campbell Brothers — some time before his arrival. Campbell entered into partnership with his brothers as merchants, importers and shipping agents until 1861 when he went to New Zealand and carried on the business of an importer and general merchant there till 1864 when he returned to Melbourne and in 1865 took the management of the auctioneering business of McCaw and another. In conjunction with William McCulloch he subsequently acquired the business, which for some years was carried on at the Royal Horse Bazaar under the style of McCulloch Campbell and Company. In 1868 J. M. Pratt became a partner and the business was transferred to Kirks Bazaar, Bourke street where it has been carried on ever since. McCulloch afterwards retired and the firm became Campbell Pratt and Company until 1887 when Pratt retired and Mr Campbell took his two sons into partnership under the title of Campbell and Sons. In June 1895, Campbell was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council for South Eastern Province, a position he held until around January 1910. Campbell died at his residence \"Myrtle Grove\", North Road, Brighton, Victoria, on 9 February 1916."

  "text" : "General James Stuart Fraser (July 1, 1783 – August 22, 1869) was a British army officer in the Madras army in India. He was involved in the Coorg War of 1834 and the town of Kushalnagar was for sometime named after him as Fraserpet. James was born at Edinburgh, the youngest son of Colonel Charles Fraser belonging to the Clan Fraser of Lovat, a naval officer who later joined the Madras army who died at Masulipatnam on May 5, 1795. James was one of six sons and three daughters through his wife Isabella Hook. James went to school at Ham, Surrey before joining Glasgow University where he showed a talent in languages and astronomy. Joining as a cadet, he went to India in 1799 and became a lieutenant in the 18th Madras native infantry by December 1800 before becoming an aide-de-camp to Sir George Barlow. His knowledge of French led him to be involved in discussions and negotiations with the French in Pondicherry. While posted at Pondicherry, he married Henrietta James at Cuddalore on 18 May 1826. In 1828 he was deputed to Mahé and made a special agent. In 1834 he saw action in the Coorg War and was appointed resident at Mysore and commissioner of Coorg on June 6, 1834. Coorg was administered from Mercara most of the year but during the monsoon, the office was shifted west to Kushalnagar which went for a period by the name of Fraserpet. He became a major-general by June 1838, considered a rapid rise for that time. From the end of 1839 he served as Resident at Hyderabad in the Nizam's kingdom. This period was a difficult one and troubled with Lord Dalhousie led him to resign in 1852 and return to England. Fraser became blind towards the end of his life and died at Twickenham Park on August 22, 1869."

  "text" : "John David Glennie (18 April 1825 – 7 January 1903) was an English clergyman and educationalist who played a single first-class cricket match for Cambridge University in 1848. He was born at Sandgate, Folkestone, Kent and died at Croxton, Staffordshire. Educated at King's School, Canterbury and Christ's College, Cambridge, Glennie made little impact in his solitary first-class cricket match, which came against a team of Kent amateurs: he scored one run in his two innings and failed to take a wicket. There are no records of him appearing in any other cricket matches, first-class or non-first-class. Glennie was ordained as a Church of England clergyman after leaving Cambridge, and was a church inspector of schools for some years, later recording his experiences in a book. From 1869 to his death in 1903 he was the vicar of Croxton, Staffordshire."

He subsequently returned to Ireland to marry Rose Ann McKibbon, returning to Upper Canada with his new bride. In 1831, Steen moved again to a new location, soon known as Steen's Falls, near the current town of Galetta and built a mill on the Mississippi River there. After Dr. Hubbell was able to purchase the water rights for that location, Steen moved down river and built a grist mill, shingle mill and lumber mill. He served as a justice of the peace for the area and also sat as a municipal councillor at Perth until 1850, when he became reeve for the new township of Fitzroy. In 1862, Steen was caught in the machinery at one of his mills and died two weeks later."

Following this he met Thor Haavie, a marine architect, at an exhibition where he was showing a design for a semisubmersible diving support vessel. Houlder build this vessel in the mid 1970s at the Aker Yard in Norway. Somehow the vessel came to be named after him and is still operating now as \"Uncle John\". The next project was the \"Orelia\" diving support vessel which is a barge like vessel with four independent diesel driven thrusters one in each corner."

  "text" : "Julian Joseph Overbeck (1820-1905) was a Roman Catholic priest who converted to Eastern Orthodoxy and became a pioneer of Western Rite Orthodoxy. The modern re-emergence of an Orthodox Western Rite begins in 1864 with the work of Overbeck, a former Catholic priest. Overbeck had left the priesthood, converted to Lutheranism and married, though it is uncertain whether he ever functioned as a Lutheran pastor. He immigrated to England in 1863 to become professor of German at the Royal Military Academy, where he also undertook studies of the Church of England and Orthodoxy. Convinced that both the Papacy and Anglicanism were on the verge of collapse, Overbeck was received into the Orthodox Church at the Russian Embassy in London by Fr. Eugene Poppoff in 1865 as a layman because he had married following his ordination. As a part of his conversion to the Orthodox Church, Overbeck had requested permission from the Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church to begin a Western Orthodox Church in England. Initially, Metropolitan Philaret was hesitant about Overbeck's request, but did not rule out the idea entirely. Overbeck outlined his rationale for a Western Orthodox Church in his book \"Catholic Orthodoxy and Anglo-Catholicism,\" a largely polemical work describing why the established Western churches should be rejected. In 1867 Overbeck also began to publish \"The Orthodox Catholic Review,\" a journal for the advancement of Western Orthodoxy. Overbeck had also begun to convince others of the feasibility of a Western Orthodox Church and was ultimately able to submit a petition of 122 signatures (mostly Tractarians) to the Holy Synod in 1869 asking for the creation of a Western Rite. A synodical commission was established to investigate the question, and Overbeck was invited to state his case before the commission in St. Petersburg in 1870. Overbeck's idea received the approval of the commission and he was instructed to present a revised Western Liturgy for evaluation by the commission, which he did in December of that year which was subsequently approved. At the same time as Overbeck was making his overtures to the Russian Church, another anonymous individual was making a similar plea to High church elements within the Anglican Church. The next several years were spent with further developing the Western liturgies for administration of the other sacraments as well as the praying of the Divine Office. Overbeck also attempted to woo Old Catholics to his scheme since they had just recently gone into schism from the Roman Catholic Church over Vatican I's definition of Papal infallibility, though to little avail. Overbeck also continued to criticize Roman Catholics and Anglicans as well as those Western converts to Orthodoxy who utilized the Byzantine Rite. By 1876, Overbeck began to make appeals to other Orthodox Churches for their recognition of his scheme. He received audiences with the Patriarch of Constantinople Joachim III and received recognition from the Patriarch of the theoretical right of Western Christians to have a Western Orthodox Church. However, Overbeck's efforts did not result in the establishment of a Western Orthodoxy. He was especially suspicious the role which the Greeks in London (and the Church of Greece generally) played in the stagnation of his ambitions, directly blaming the Greek Church's protest against the plan in 1892. The Orthodox Catholic Review published its final issue in 1885 and Overbeck died in 1905 without seeing the implementation of the Western Orthodox Church. Georges Florovsky summed up Overbeck's experience in this way: \"it was not just a fantastic dream. The question raised by Overbeck was pertinent, even if his own answer to it was confusedly conceived. And probably the vision of Overbeck was greater than his personal interpretation.\""

  "text" : "Jack Lotto (1857–1944) was a music hall performer of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras whose speciality was a trick-cycling act. With entertainer Joe Elvin he co-founded the show business charity the Grand Order of Water Rats in 1889. Later he managed his children in the popular cycling act 'Lotto, Lilo and Otto'. Lotto was born as John Egginton or Eginton in 1857 in Kinver in Staffordshire, the son of Elizabeth and Joseph Eggington, a Bundler of Iron. In 1877 in Sheffield he married Clara Parkin (1861-1904), the daughter of John Parkin and Martha Sutcliffe. Their children were Alfred (born 1878), Walter (born 1879), Ernest (born 1881), Annie (born 1883), John (1884), Clara (born 1886), Albert (born 1887), Arthur (born 1890), Joseph (1891), Daisy (1892), Charlotte (known as Lottie) (1893), John (1893), Edward (known as Val Lotto) (1895), May (born 1896), Victoria (born 1896), Bertie (1897) and Winnie (1898-1899). Several of the children were managed by their father in the music hall trick-cycling act 'The Lottos', or as 'Lotto, Lilo and Otto - The Champion Juvenile Bicyclists'. In 1889 Lotto and entertainer Joe Elvin owned a trotting pony called The Magpie. On one occasion The Magpie was described as \"looking like a drowned rat.\" As the pony was a regular race winner, its owners decided that they would use the profits to help performers who were less fortunate than themselves. Taking the name from their wet, bedraggled pony, the Grand Order of Water Rats was formed to collate their efforts, as well as to serve as a social club for performers. In September 1899 'Lotto, Lilo and Otto' appeared at the Shoreditch Empire in London, at the Charing Cross Music Hall in Lambeth in May 1894, and at the Tivoli Music Hall on The Strand in March 1895. 'Lotto, Lilo and Otto' also appeared in the silent film Clever and Comic Cycle Act in 1900, directed by James Williamson and filmed at Hove in Sussex. On his death in Croydon in Surrey in 1944 he was buried next to his friends and fellow music hall entertainers Joe Elvin and Eugene Stratton at Bandon Hill Cemetery."

Ill health had prevented him taking up employment as a Minister when he was initially approved to preach by the Presbytery of Glasgow in 1858 and later after he was appointed to Tiree by the Duke of Argyll in 1861, parishioners objected to his manner of preaching. Several of the anecdotes he amassed were published in magazines and, just before his death, work began on collating the first of four compendiums of the tales; three were published a few years after his death. He was fluent in several languages, including Scottish Gaelic, and transcribed the legends precisely as dictated by the narrators."

  "text" : "Jennifer Lee Barringer is an attorney known for defending music producer Phil Spector in his two murder trials. She was the only attorney from the original team who was requested to return by Mr. Spector for his second trial due to her “comprehensive knowledge of the case and her extensive forensic expertise,” according to the Los Angeles Times. Ms. Barringer's other high-profile cases include the “New Jersey Turnpike Shooting Cases” with Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld, Johnnie Cochran and Linda Kenney-Baden and former New Jersey Nets basketball star Jayson Williams. Most recently, Ms. Barringer worked as both a trial member and consultant with the Casey Anthony defense team and is also a regular commentator and legal analyst on Tru TV, Fox News, HLN, CBS and CNN. Ms. Barringer is often sought after for high-profile murder and rape cases due to her specialty in forensics which she honed while working on the Innocence Project and by participating in numerous cases with some of the most respected forensic experts in the world, including Dr. Michael Baden, Dr. Henry Lee, Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Werner Spitz, Jim Pex and Stuart James among many others. She is well versed in all areas of criminology, pathology, blood spatter pattern analysis, DNA interpretation and toxicology. Ms. Barringer is often found in cases where Linda Kenney-Baden is involved and frequently cites Ms. Kenney-Baden as her mentor. Before becoming an attorney, Ms. Barringer spent 3 years in Germany working as a news anchor for Deutsche Welle and the BBC. During that time, she originated numerous shows, performed interviews and was the only female anchor of the nightly news. Ms. Barringer went on Fox news after the Dallas police shootings on 7/7/16 and made the news herself for being an \"expert\" on forensics and firearms who inaccurately proclaimed hunting rifles could be bought at grocery stores in Texas, made fully automatic with mods, and turned into assault weapons simply by putting a scope on them. She came off looking extremely foolish, and in dire need of rehabilitating her credibility! Ms. Barringer received her B.A. from Rutgers University in Journalism and History and her juris doctorate from Cardozo Law School in N.Y.C.. She is a member of SAG and AFTRA and is suspended from practicing law in the state of New Jersey."

Garnett played in two matches in the space of eight days, batting in the Cambridge University middle order in both of them; he failed to score in either innings in his first match, but scored 20 and 21 in his second game. His batting style is not known and there is no record whether he bowled or not; there are no extant records of appearances in other major or minor cricket matches. Alumni Cantabrigienses, the directory of Cambridge University students, identifies Garnett as the son of William Garnett, rector of St Michael's Church, Barbados (now the Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels).

In 2015, Greenwood was loaned to Salford Red Devils and Hull Kingston Rovers, where he made 12 appearances, impressing enough to turn his loan deal from the Wigan Warriors into a full-time two-year contract. After Hull Kingston Rovers relegation at the end of 2016 Greenwood turned his back on a lucrative butler contract down under citing creative differences, and instead signed on as the personal sous chef and barista at the Barrett food empire in Kingston Upon Hull. A return to rovers cannot be ruled out due to his fine performances in 2016, though doubts have arisen after Greenwood was implicated in a global TimTam smuggling plot, police in the UK and Australia were alerted as the name GREENWOOD is widely acknowledged as the number one player in the fake Penguin market down under."

  "text" : "John Michael Anthony Koerner (September 29, 1913 – February 23, 2014) was a Czechoslovakian-born artist in British Columbia, Canada. He was born in Moravia, the son of Theodor Koerner, part of a family involved in the lumber industry. Koerner was exposed to art at an early age in Paris and Italy. Although his ultimate goal was to become an artist, on his father's advice, he studied law at Charles University in Prague and at the Sorbonne. With the rise of the Third Reich in Germany, he left Prague with his father and uncles, settling in Paris. However, it became necessary for the family to leave again and, the following year, they arrived in Vancouver, British Columbia. He worked in the family lumber business for twelve years before returning to his first love, art. He also taught at the Vancouver School of Art and the University of British Columbia. A number of his works were acquired by the National Gallery of Canada. He also became friends with painter Lawren Harris, who invited him to join the exhibition committee of the Vancouver Art Gallery. His work also appears in the collections of the Tate in London, of Clare Hall at Cambridge University and of the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, DC. His work was influenced by German philosopher Bo Yin Ra. Following his 100th birthday, Koerner had a show at the Burnaby Art Gallery and the exhibition John Koerner: The Hidden Side of Nature at the Penticton Art Gallery. He died at home in Vancouver at the age of 100. He was married twice: first to Eileen Newby, who died in 2001, and then to Lisa Birnie."

Harris's major cricket career was largely confined to 1859, when he appeared as a batsman and bowler of unknown style in several non-first-class matches as well as in Cambridge's four first-class fixtures, which included the University match. No great indication of his merits in either batting or bowling can be gained, as his bowling figures are incomplete and he never took more than two wickets in an innings, and his position in the batting order varied between the tail-end and occasional outings as an opening batsman."

  "text" : "James Potter Davenport (1841–1905) was a Los Angeles, California, City Council member who was the first official in the United States to be removed from office in a recall election. He was born in western Virginia in 1841. He served in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War, first on the Mississippi River and then on the Pacific Coast, where he was mustered out at war's end. He settled in Nevada City, California, and married, then he moved with his family to San Francisco and was a salesman with Sherwood & Sherwood. About 1892 he relocated to Los Angeles. Davenport was elected in 1902 as a Republican in the Sixth Ward of the Los Angeles City Council but was recalled the next year in the first such election in the nation. He had voted in favor of a city printing contract awarded to the Los Angeles Times even though the Times' bid was $10,000 higher than its nearest competitor. The recall petition also accused him of \"aiding and abetting in the erection of a large and offensive slaughter-house.\" In the election Davenport was beaten by Arthur D. Houghton. The recall was later ruled invalid by the State Supreme Court because of fictitious or unwarranted names on the petition, with Davenport entitled to four months' back pay. Later he worked on behalf of the Los Angeles Humane Society and in the year of his death was \"laboring earnestly to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors. . . . His efforts were aimed directly at dealers who conduct small stands in the vicinity of schools.\" Davenport died on December 1, 1905, when a streetcar on which he was riding was struck by another one at the intersection of Washington Street and Burlington Avenue in today's Pico-Union neighborhood and overturned, crushing him and injuring 20 others. He was survived by his widow and three daughters, Mrs. R.M. Watson, Mrs. G.M. Crowe and Ethel Davenport."

  "text" : "Joan Sophia Kersey, née Walder (6 October 1926 – 2013) was an Australian writer, social worker and left-wing activist. Her parents, Arthur Walder and Millie, née Bowen, were part of a prominent and wealthy family; her uncle Sir Samuel was Lord Mayor of Sydney in 1932 and later served as a United Australia Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. Sir William McMahon, Prime Minister from 1971 to 1972, was one of her cousins. She received a Bachelor of Arts in 1947 from the University of Sydney and a diploma in social studies in 1950. In 1952 she married Royal Navy officer Michael Kersey, and moved around with him to Scotland, Malta and New Zealand; on his retirement, they settled in Armidale to manage a grazing property. There Kersey became involved in organisations such as the Save the Children Fund, Family Planning, and Zero Population Growth, and joined the Australia Party, forerunner of the Australian Democrats. After her separation from her husband, Kersey moved back to Sydney and became involved in the nuclear disarmament, women's rights and conservation movements. She ran three times for the seat of Wentworth for the Democrats. After retiring from social work she studied at the University of New England and gained a Master of Letters. Kersey published four books: High Society: The Legalisation of Illicit Drugs (1994), The New Aged: An Untapped Resource (1997), 2050: A Drug Odyssey (2002), and her autobiography, My Life: While Busy Making Other Plans (2006). A member of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Amnesty International, Justice Action, the Friends of the United Nations, and Community Action Abroad, her activism continued into her 70s and 80s, campaigning for a republic and a carbon price and against the Iraq War and the treatment of refugees. In her later years she supported the Australian Greens. Kersey died in 2013."

He made his fortune through tin mines, mostly from the Wheal Reeth mine, but also from the St. Ives Consols mine. He used the Consols mine to create a political base for himself, by building the village of Halsetown to accommodate the mine-workers. The village was within the boundaries of the parliamentary borough of St Ives, allowing Halse patronage of the borough's two seats in Parliament. At the 1820 general election, both seats were taken by Halse's supporters, but his rival the borough-monger Sir Christopher Hawkins pursued him with charges of bribery, and at the 1826 election both Hawkins and Halse were elected. He was defeated at the 1830 election by William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley, nephew of the Duke of Wellington, but regained the seat in 1831 and held it until his death. In 1835, he was blackballed by the recently created St. Ives Library and Institution."

With his pioneering approach to retail trade and advanced manufacturing methods he was able to make his way on three continents where, from 1931 to 1939, he was progressively developing a network of more than 130 retail shops of large capacity and several tens of business representations and plants. He was the first to vertically integrate the sale of ready-made clothing from the manufacturing process to retail, and thus he showed the way to current luxury houses such as Chanel and Hermes. He implemented many innovative approaches into practice which were also used by Ford or Bata. His products were at the top of the textile tradition in the Czechoslovak Republic which had begun in 1858 with the first plant for ready-made clothing in Europe built right in Nehera’s hometown of Prostějov. This tradition is still alive in many garment factories in Prostějov or Trenčín."

  "text" : "Evelita Juanita Spinelli (October 17, 1889 - November 22, 1941) nicknamed The Duchess, was the first woman to be executed by the state of California. She was a gangster and ex-wrestler. FBI profiler Candice DeLong described Spinelli as a \"stone cold psychopath who had no use for anybody, other than what she could get out of them.\" Young delinquent homeless men were regularly taken into her house. She would cook and clean for them and train them to be professional criminals. Her daughter, Gypsy, regularly used a honey trap to snare drunken men, who were consequently mugged. The men received a ten dollar weekly allowance, with Spinelli receiving the lion's share of their ill-gotten gains. Two of her protegees, Albert Ives and Robert Sherrod, killed Leland Cash during a mugging (when he reached into his pocket to turn up his hearing aid, Ives assumed he was reaching for a gun and shot Cash in the stomach). Fearing Sherrord would confess to the police, Spinelli gave him whiskey that she had laced with chloral hydrate. The gang then beat him up whilst he was unconscious. To make his death appear accidental, they threw him off a bridge wearing only swimming trunks. However, the autopsy showed there was no water in his lungs. Fearing for his own survival, Ives escaped and confessed to the police. Spinelli was consequently arrested. Her gang members testified against her at her trial. She was described by a warden as \"the coldest, hardest character, male or female, I have ever known, a homely, scrawny, nearsighted, sharp-featured scarecrow. . . . The Duchess was a hag, evil as a witch, horrible to look at, impossible to like.\" She was executed November 22, 1941, at the age of 52."

  "text" : "John D. Niles is an American scholar of Old English literature best known for his work on Beowulf and the theory of oral literature. A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his higher degrees (B.A. in English, 1967; PhD in Comparative Literature, 1972), he taught for an initial four years as Assistant Professor of English at Brandeis University, then joined the faculty of the Department of English at the University of California, Berkeley, where he remained for twenty-six years. In 2001 he joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he taught for ten years in the Department of English, was named the Frederic G. Cassidy Professor of Humanities, and was a Senior Fellow at the UW Institute for the Humanities. After his retirement in 2011 he has remained active in research as Professor Emeritus at both UC Berkeley and UW-Madison. Niles is the author of eight books on Old English literature and related topics in addition to upwards of sixty scholarly articles and two chapbooks. He has edited or co-edited another eight books, including A Beowulf Handbook (with Robert E. Bjork, 1997) and Klaeber's Beowulf, 4th edn (with R.D. Fulk and Robert E. Bjork, 2008). During the 1980s he conducted extensive fieldwork into singing and storytelling traditions in Scotland, particularly among Scotland's traveling people, and this resulted in his 1997 book Homo Narrans: The Poetics and Anthropology of Oral Literature. In 2005 he taught a seminar at the Newberry Library, Chicago on the early history of Old English studies, and this became the kernel of his 2015 book The Idea of Anglo-Saxon England 1066-1901. His researches into the archaeology and prehistory of early Northwest Europe led to the joint publication Beowulf and Leyre (2007), which features a mine of information about the prehistoric Danish site (at the present-day hamlet of Lejre) where much of the imagined action of Beowulf is set."

  "text" : "John Leonard Knapp (9 May 1767 - 29 April 1845) was an English botanist best known for his Journal of a Naturalist and his work on British grasses. Born at Shenley, Buckinghamshire, John Leonard Knapp was the son of Primatt Knapp, rector of Shenley. Educated at Thame grammar school, Knapp entered the navy, but finding the sea unsuited to his health, he resigned and served successively in the Herefordshire and Northamptonshire militia, becoming a captain in the latter. He lived for a time at Powick, near Worcester, and was then in the habit of making long summer botanical excursions. On one of these he visited Scotland in company with Scottish botanist George Don and collected several of the rarest species of British grasses. In 1804 he published Gramina Britannica, or Representations of the British Grasses on 119 coloured plates, with Descriptions, in quarto, the figures being executed by himself. This edition was, with the exception of a hundred copies, destroyed by a fire at Bensley's, the printers, and the book was not reissued until 1842. In 1818 Knapp published anonymously a poem entitled \"Arthur, or the Pastor of the Village,\" and between 1820 and 1830 a series of articles, under the title of ‘The Naturalist's Diary,’ in the almanac series ‘Time's Telescope.’ These formed the germ of his most successful work, the Journal of a Naturalist, published anonymously in 1829, which went through three editions during his lifetime. It was published in America in 1853 as Country Rambles in England with an introduction and notes by Susan Fenimore Cooper. Knapp viewed it as a botanical companion to Gilbert White's ‘Selborne.’ He lived till 1813 at Llanfoist, near Abergavenny, and subsequently at Alveston, near Bristol, where he died. In 1804 he married Lydia Frances Freeman (1772-1838), daughter of Arthur Freeman of Antigua, by whom he had seven children; two sons and a daughter survived him. His son Arthur John Knapp (d. 1883) was a Bristol solicitor and one of the original promoters of the Great Western Railway. Knapp became in 1796 a fellow of the Linnean Society, and was also a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. The genus of grasses previously named Mibora by Adanson was called Knappia by Smith (although the original name is now used), and Rhynchoglossum of Blume was similarly unsuccessfully renamed by F. Bauer. The standard author abbreviation Knapp is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Jill Coit is an ex-model, who has been married over ten times and is currently in prison at the Denver Women's Correctional Facility for murder. Whilst renovating a bed and breakfast with her sons, she regularly visited Gerald Boggs' hardware store. Boggs married her at the age of 50, his first marriage after Coit faked a pregnancy. Boggs' brother Doug was concerned by Coit's interest in her husband's finances. He hired a private investigator, who discovered that Coit was a fraud: she had been married 11 times and had several aliases and had been involved in various financial and insurance scams. In addition she was still married to her seventh husband. Boggs annulled the marriage. Coit began a relationship with Michael Backus, and convinced him to help her murder Boggs. Wearing a disguise (which included a false moustache) Coit murdered him using a 22-calibre pistol and a stun gun, with the assistance of Backus. She then informed her son who reported her to the police. She was found guilty of first degree murder. She is currently serving a life sentence with no possibility of parole. William Coit, her third husband, was also shot dead in the back. She was suspected of the murder, but the police could never find sufficient evidence to charge her (and she checked herself into a mental hospital to avoid further questioning). Coit also persuaded an elderly gentleman to adopt her, and subsequently inherited his money. She was portrayed by Bonnie Bedelia in the film Legacy of Sin. Her case was also featured on Forensic Files, American Justice, Deadly Women and Facing Evil with Candice DeLong. New DetectivesTrue Crime"

  "text" : "Jared Carter (June 14, 1801 – July 6, 1849) was an early leader in the Latter Day Saint movement. He has been described as \"one of the Church's great missionaries\" of the 1830s. Carter was born in Killingworth, Connecticut, and had moved with his family to Benson, Vermont, by 1810. In 1831, while living in Broome County, New York, he was introduced to the Book of Mormon and the new church founded by Joseph Smith the year before. On February 20, 1831, Carter was baptized into the Church of Christ by Hyrum Smith. In June, Carter was made a priest and in September, he was made an elder. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed by Smith to be a missionary in the eastern United States. On this mission, he healed and baptized John Tanner, one of the primary financial benefactors of the early church, and Zera Pulsipher, who became a leader in the church. Between 1831 and 1834, Carter served missions in the eastern states, Michigan Territory, and Upper Canada. Carter introduced Mormonism to his brother John, who also became a leader in the church. In May 1833, Carter became a high priest and became a member of the building committee of the Kirtland Temple. On February 17, 1834, Carter and his brother John became two of the inaugural members of the first presiding high council of the church in Kirtland, Ohio. Carter became the president of this body on September 9, 1837, and continued as a member of it when church headquarters were moved to Far West, Missouri, and then to Nauvoo, Illinois. In Missouri in 1838, Carter was one of the leaders of the Danites with Sampson Avard and George W. Robinson. Carter is mentioned in a number of the revelations of Smith which make up the Doctrine and Covenants; one section is addressed directly to Carter. Upon the death of Joseph Smith, Carter supported the succession claims of James Strang. Carter joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) in 1846, but was excommunicated within months of joining. After his excommunication, Carter joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Chicago. He moved to DeKalb County, Illinois, where he died before he could rejoin the majority of LDS Church members in Utah Territory."

Jackson serves in the United States Army National Guard and saw active duty in Afghanistan. He later worked as a prosecutor in Gaston County, North Carolina. When Sen. Dan Clodfelter resigned to become Mayor of Charlotte in 2014, Jackson was selected by local Democrats in the Mecklenburg County district to serve out the remainder of Clodfelter's term. They also chose him to replace Clodfelter as the Democratic nominee on the November 2014 general election ballot. Because no other person had filed to run against Clodfelter for the seat, Jackson would run unopposed for a full two-year term. Jackson gained national attention when he was the only legislator to show up for work on a snow day in February, 2015. \"On Twitter and Facebook, he embarked on a progressive dream agenda for the state of North Carolina. Of course, it was all in good fun, but his posts to social media also contributed to a clear enunciation of what North Carolina's real agenda\" could look like. He expanded child care subsidies, strengthened early childhood education, established independent redistricting, raised teacher pay, invested in wind and solar energy, and settled a long-standing dispute regarding Charlotte's airport in favor of the city. It was widely termed the \"Best Snow Day Ever.\""

  "text" : "Joseph Coe (November 12, 1784 – October 17, 1854) was a leader in the early days of the Latter Day Saint movement. Coe was born in Cayuga County, New York. In 1831, while living in Macedon, New York, he joined the newly established Church of Christ, led by Joseph Smith. He was ordained an elder and moved his family to Kirtland, Ohio to join the main gathering of Latter Day Saints. In 1831 he served short missions to New York and Missouri. In August 1831, Coe was one of the individuals who assisted Smith in laying the cornerstones for the temple at the Temple Lot in Independence, Missouri. Coe was ordained a high priest by Smith on October 1, 1831, and in 1834 he became one of the twelve inaugural members of the presiding high council in Kirtland; he was a member of the high council until 1837. In 1835, Coe provided $800 of the $2400 used by the church to purchase some mummies and papyri which Smith used to produce the Book of Abraham. After the collapse of the Kirtland Safety Society, Coe became one of the Latter Day Saint dissenters. He was \"cut off\" from the church by the high council in December 1837 and was formally excommunicated in December 1838. Coe lived the rest of his life in Kirtland and did not associate with any Latter Day Saint group after his excommunication. Coe died in Kirtland when he was trampled by his bull on his farm. He was buried in the Kirtland North Cemetery."

In 1765, after the death of Françoise of Parckstein, the previous mistress of the elector, she attracted the attention of elector Charles Theodore at the opera in Mannheim and was made his mistress. Josepha von Heydeck was described as pretty, sensible, merciful and kind. Upon the wish of the elector, she was discreet in her public appearances as Charles Theodore, though separated from his spouse electress Elizabeth Auguste, found it important that his spouse's position as electress should not be undermined. 19 March 1767, she was given the fief of Heydeck, and at the birth of her daughter in 1768, Charles Theodore legitimized the child, and gave both mother and child the title Countess of Heydeck. She was given her own house in Mannheim. She died in childbirth in 1771."

  "text" : "Juha Matti Ahokas (born September 18, 1969 in Kokkola) is a retired amateur Finnish Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's super heavyweight category. Ahokas has won thirty Finnish championship titles, collected four medals (one gold, two silver, and one bronze) at the European Championships, and also represented his nation Finland in four editions of the Olympic Games (1988, 1992, 1996, and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Ahokas trained for Nurmon Jymy Wrestling Club in Seinäjoki under his father and personal coach Risto Ahokas. Ahokas made his official debut, as an 18-year-old teen, at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, where he lost the second round of the elimination pool to U.S. wrestler Dennis Koslowski in the men's heavyweight division. Four years later, at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Ahokas competed in the super heavyweight category (130 kg) and slammed Greece's Panagiotis Poikilidis off the mat with a 1–0 sudden death lead to finish strongly in seventh. Determined to return to the Olympic scene and medal, Ahokas entered the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta as a top medal favorite in the men's 130 kg class. He beat Sweden's Tomas Johansson in his opening match, but suffered a tremendous fall from the unbeatable Russian and reigning Olympic champion Aleksandr Karelin in the third round. Facing off against Ukraine's Petro Kotok in the fourth repechage, Ahokas could not score a single point to subdue his opponent and lost the match with a fourteenth-place finish. Despite a stunning upset from his third Games, Ahokas took home his first medal at the 1997 European Championships in Kouvola, and continued to flourish his sporting success in the late 1990s and early 2000s, until he wrestled Hungary's Mihály Deák-Bárdos for the gold in the 120-kg division at the 2003 European Championships in Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro. Eight years after his last Olympics and having missed the previous Games due to back injury, Ahokas qualified for the Finnish squad, as a 34-year-old veteran, in the men's 120 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, he received a ticket and rounded out the seventh spot from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Créteil, France. Aged and frail, Ahokas lost two straight matches to his former rival Deák-Bárdos (0–3) and Iran's Sajjad Barzi through a 1–2 tight brawl in the prelim pool, finishing only in seventeenth place out of twenty super heavyweight wrestlers. Ahokas ended his illustrious sporting career with another silver medal at the 2006 European Championships in Moscow, before he officially retired by the following year due to spinal and shoulder injuries sustained in the past."

Considered one of Asia's top wrestlers in his decade, Kenjeev has collected a total of five medals at the Asian Championships, picked up two bronze in the 84-kg division at the Asian Games (2006 and 2010), and also represented his nation Kyrgyzstan, as a 19-year-old teen, at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Throughout his sporting career, Kenjeev trains for Sduschor 1 Wrestling Club in Bishkek, under his personal coach Hakim Makhmudov. Kenjeev qualified for the Kyrgyz squad in the men's 84 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics by gaining an allocated bid and placing fourth from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. He lost three straight matches to Sweden's Ara Abrahamian, Japan's Shingo Matsumoto, and Slovakia's Attila Bátky in the four-man prelim pool, finishing thirteenth overall in the final standings. At the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, Kenjeev came strong in the same tournament, and proceeded to take home the bronze medal in a match against the host nation's Idrees Rahman with a 14–6 decision. Kenjeev also sought his bid to compete for his second Olympics in Beijing and possibly London, but finished farther from the top spot twice in the Olympic Qualification Tournament. Despite a double Olympic setback, Kenjeev managed to collect another bronze medal in the 84-kg division at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China, outclassing India's Manoj Kumar by a three-point advantage. Ten years after competing in his first Olympics, Kenjeev reached the peak of his sporting career as he defeated Iranian wrestler Yousef Ghaderian for the gold in the 80-kg division at the 2014 Asian Wrestling Championships in Astana, Kazakhstan, producing a remarkable medal tally of five (the other contained a silver and three bronze)."

  "text" : "John Penros, or Penrose (died 1411) was a Cornish-born lawyer and judge who held high office as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and subsequently served as a High Court judge in England and Wales. Despite his high office, he was guilty of \"an extraordinary career of crime\" which stretched over nearly forty years : when the charges against him were eventually proved, he was removed from the Bench. He belonged to a landowning family which came from Escalls in Cornwall. He was a qualified advocate, but also became known as a notorious law-breaker, who along with his associates John Trevarthian senior (died 1395), and his son John Trevarthian junior (died 1405) was notorious as one of the principal disturbers of the peace in Cornwall. What was later described as his \"remarkable career of crime\" began about 1370. In 1483 he was indicted in Surrey for his role in the murder of Richard Eyre, a fellow Cornishman whose family had a long-standing feud with the Trevarthians. The following year a warrant for his arrest was issued, but was later withdrawn, apparently on the ground that he was not a principal actor in the murder. The list of serious crimes of which the Trevarthians were accused, and to most of which Penrose was said to be at least an accessory, grew to a remarkable length: it included their private war with the Eyre family, which had resulted in the murder of Richard Eyre in 1483, as well as piracy, burglary and treason. In time however the Trevarthian family became both wealthy and respectable: at the time of his death in 1405 John Trevarthian junior was Sheriff of Cornwall. Despite his appalling criminal record, Penros was sent to Ireland as Lord Chief Justice in 1385. He returned without permission to England the following year and as a result was accused of misconduct. Again he seems to have escaped serious censure, despite his reputation as \"a notorious criminal\". In 1391 he was appointed a justice of the King's Bench  and became justice of South Wales in 1393. He was a trier of petitions in the House of Commons of 1394, but was eventually removed from the Bench on the ground of his record as a notorious criminal (even though the career of his accomplice John Trevarthian junior was still flourishing). Penros married firstly Joan, daughter of Richard Carnver, who died about 1391, and secondly, about 1395, Constance, of whom little is known. By Joan he had at least two sons, William and John; John is said to have been an \"imbecile from birth\". Penros died in 1411."

Although his clients had a high opinion of him, Glaser was a feared person in the business industry. Associated Booking Corporation or \"ABC\" as it is also known as, has at various times represented Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Woody Herman, Dave Brubeck, Barbra Streisand, B.B.

  "text" : "John Timlin is a theatre producer, literary agent and was the administrator of the Australian Performing Group in Melbourne. At the time Timlin was requested to invest in the APG, he ran a business in North Melbourne manufacturing weighbridges. After locating a desirable venue in Carlton's leafy Drummond St, to serve as a possible new base for the APG, Graeme Blundell approached Timlin for financing the property in 1970. Timlin agreed and took out a three-year lease on the property for $100 a week. The existing structure on the property was built in 1912 to originally serve as a livery, since that time it was rumoured to have been a brothel, a German Club, a boxing ring and a dance hall. But most famously, as declared by the fading sign on the building's turret, it had manufactured prams in the 1920s; prompting the inspiration of the moniker The Pram Factory. Timlin was to oversee the APG through most of its existence, being described as the group's \"organiser, administrator and bagman\". Notable APG member Bruce Spence said of him, \"He did the things we wouldn't stoop to do. He got us the money that gave us the freedom to do what we creatively wanted. He spoke to the bureaucrats. He was the respectable face fronting all us ratbags just wanting to tear the place apart.\". Another prominent APG member, Kerry Dwyer described Timlin as one of the \"Irish heavies\" in the group who \"ran the office from the pub\". Throughout his time with the APG, he was involved in a variety of roles for many of the productions, including construction, set design, producing and is credited as a co-creator of the outside production of 'Goodbye Ted' with Jack Hibberd and 'The Dudders' with John Romeril. He was involved in the founding of an APG label, Pram Factory Productions, which co-financed the 1979 film adaptation of Hibberd's 1969 hit Dimboola. The Almost Managing Company, which acted as both literary and actors' agency for people involved with the APG, was another enterprise. After the demise of the APG in 1981, Timlin continued to work with various ex-members of the group, including producing the musical adaptation of Manning Clark's The History of Australia and many satirical live shows with Max Gillies such as A Night With The Right, The Max Gillies Summit and A Night of National Reconciliation culminating in packaging The Gillies Report for ABC television. He continued his work as director of the Almost Managing Company till its sale to Bryson Investments. In recent years Timlin has delivered much documentation regarding his work in the theatre to various museums and libraries while still working as a literary agent and editor."

Balfour became a Tory Member of Parliament (MP) from 1826 to 1834, but never achieved ministerial office. However, many of his descendants found fame and success, including his grandson Arthur Balfour,who served as prime minister from 1902 to 1905.

In 1928 he was elected to the senate of the Mysore University. In 1930 he became a member of the legislature (later Legislative Assembly) of the Mysore state. He would continue to be a Mysore legislator until 1957. Politically, he was a member of the All India Muslim League. Between 1933 and 1936 he served as the first non-official president of the Jagalur Municipal Council. He was the president of the Chitaldrug District Board between 1936 and 1940. He also held various posts in different companies. He served as Minister for Education, Railways and Public Works Departments in the government of the Mysore State between June 1941 – 1945. In 1945 the Maharaja of Mysore named him 'Mushir ul-Mulk' ('Advisor of the Kingdom'). In 1947 he left the Muslim League. After the independence of India, he became a member of the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party (which later, to J. Mohammed Imam's disappointment, merged into the Praja Socialist Party). He served as Leader of the Opposition in the Mysore Legislative Assembly from 1948 onwards. Key political themes of J. Mohammed Imam were secularism and anti-communism. J. Mohammed Imam was elected to the Lok Sabha (lower house of the parliament of India) in the 1957 general election. He stood as the PSP candidate in Chitaldrug constituency, obtaining 129,848 votes (52.25% of the votes in the constituency). In the Second Lok Sabha he was a member of the Panel of Chairmen. In 1959 he joined the Swatantra Party. In the 1962 Indian general election, he contested the Bellary Lok Sabha seat as a Swatantra Party candidate. He finished in second place with 137,448 votes (48.02%). He regained the Chitaldrug (now renamed Chitradruga) seat in the 1967 Indian general election, obtaining 164,548 votes (50.45%). He lost the Chitradruga seat in the 1971 Indian general election. He finished in second place with 81,303 votes (24.16%)."

  "text" : "James Bovell (1817-1880) was a prominent Canadian physician, microscopist, educator, theologian and minister. In his youth, he traveled to London to study medicine at Guy's Hospital. There, he was related to Sir Astley Cooper and had Richard Bright and Thomas Addison among his professors, and Robert Graves and William Stokes among his colleagues. He studied at schools in Edinburgh and Glasgow and later was elected a member of the Royal College of Physicians. When he returned to Canada he worked on the fields of pathology and clinical microscopy, and he founded the Upper Canada Journal of Medical, Surgical, and Physical Science which he edited. He became an important member of the Canadian Institute and later became a Vicepresident of it. He became an early mentor of the famous physician William Osler, whom he strongly influenced in his early years. Bovell later became a clergyman of the Church of England and wrote on the topic of natural theology. He is known for his rejection of the Darwinian theory of evolution and Lyell's geology, believing instead in the Book of Genesis on the side of the early Louis Agassiz and John Hunter. Yet, he wrote on the relation of religion and science. In a book published in 1860 he wrote to the Diocese of Huron \"with the hope that the explanations given may remove erroneous impressions\" at the Church in Canada."

  "text" : "Sir John de Sotheron (died after 1398) was an English landowner, lawyer and judge, who served briefly as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. He was the son of Thomas de Sotheron, Lord of the Manor of Great Mitton in Lancashire; Mitton had passed to the de Sotherons from the de Mitton family. He had inherited his father's lands before 1368, when he was involved in a dispute over the advowson of Mitton Church, and in February of that year was defendant in a claim for a debt of 40 shillings brought by William de Mirfeld. He is known to have been acting as an attorney at this time. In 1377 he was pardoned for killing John de Holden. He lived in a violent age, where case of manslaughter, and even murder, among the ruling class were not uncommon, and a royal pardon was fairly easy to obtain; nor would the crime necessarily hinder one's career, as de Sotheron's own later life shows. In 1384 he was sent to Ireland as Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, but for some unexplained he reason took up office as the senior Chief Justice instead. He served for one year, returned to England, then came back to Ireland in 1386, apparently as an adviser to Sir John Stanley, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He remained in Ireland for several years, probably living at Dangan, County Meath. Ball states that his wife Joanna was kidnapped from Dangan Castle in 1392, but gives no further details of the episode. He returned to England soon afterwards, was knighted, and retired to his estates in Lancashire. He married Joanna, daughter of Sir Simon Cusack, and had at least two surviving children. He was still living in 1397/8, when he and his son and heir Christopher were in dispute with Roger White and others as to the ownership of lands at Mitton. The estate passed to Christopher, whose descendants remained there for several generations. The surname was later spelt Sherburne."

  "text" : "Jin Moyu (Chinese: 金默玉; pinyin: Jīn Mòyù; 1918 – May 26, 2014), also known as Aisin Gioro Xianqi (Chinese: 愛新覺羅·顯琦; pinyin: Àixīnjuéluó Xiǎnqí), was a Chinese educator and the last surviving Manchu princess. She was the 17th daughter of Shanqi, the 10th heir to the Prince Su peerage of the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Qing dynasty, which ended with the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. Jin's elder sister was Yoshiko Kawashima, a Japanese spy who was executed by the Chinese Nationalist Government as a traitor in March 1948. Jin was born in Lüshun in 1918, seven years after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Both her father and mother died when she was just four years old. She was raised by her three stepsisters after he parents' deaths. She lived in Japan as a student. However, Jin chose to move back to Beijing when she was nineteen years old to pursue a career as either a journalist or entertainer. She settled for a position with a Japanese firm instead. Jin's elder brothers lost most of the Aisin Gioro family fortune in 1948 after the Chinese Civil War. The brothers fled to British Hong Kong, leaving Jin to take care of the her six nieces and nephews, as well as Jin's own daughter and the family's elderly nanny. Nearly destitute, Jin sold most of the possessions in her family home. She also earned additional income by selling knitted jumpers and taking out loans. Jin opened her own restaurant specialising in Sichuan cuisine in 1952. She married Chinese artist Ma Wanli in 1953 (Jin was Ma's third wife). Jin left her restaurant around the time of her wedding and took a position with the country's central translation agency. In February 1958, Jin was arrested at her home and imprisoned, due solely to her being a descendent of the former imperial family. She remained in prison for 15 years, until her release as a forced farm labourer in 1973. She struggled for several years. In 1978, Jin wrote a letter to Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping pleading for a job. Deng gave her a new job soon after. During the 1980s, Jin began planning to create a Japanese language school in China. She and her second husband opened a school in Hebei in 1996. Jin died at a hospital in Beijing on May 26, 2014, at the age of 95."

Leonard, the son of Arthur H. Leonard, Jr. and Marjorie Irene Leonard, was from south Florida and beginning in 1971 chased tropical cyclones in the United States and the Caribbean, as well as on Guam and Hawaii. He sometimes moved to Guam during typhoon season. He was considered a preeminent tropical cyclone chaser. Leonard began chasing thunderstorms in 1974 and traveled across the Great Plains as well as locally in Florida where sea breeze interactions and waterspouts are common in summer. He sometimes moved to Oklahoma during supercell season in Tornado Alley. Leonard's photographs, films and videos have been licensed widely and featured prominently around the world. He was featured in numerous television broadcasts and magazine articles. He was a contributor to Storm Track magazine and his photographs appeared frequently in Weatherwise and other publications. Leonard was also an early and respected storm chasing tour guide, working with Charles Edwards for Cloud 9 Tours, where George Kourounis and Mike Theiss also are guides."

  "text" : "Joshua Routledge (27 April 1773 – 8 February 1829) was an engineer and inventor during the late 18th and early 19th centuries when the Industrial Revolution was in full swing. Mechanical engineering as a profession was on the rise, and the advent of the steam age opened up viable career alternatives for many young Englishmen who, like Joshua Routledge, had grown up in an agriculture-based society. Born on 27 April 1773 and baptised on the 29th in Riccall Yorkshire,. Joshua Routledge was third of ten children. Generations of Routledges had been established as yeoman farmers and weavers in Riccall, a village about 9 miles (14 km) south of the city of York. Sometime before 1778, Joshua's parents, William (1744–1822) and Sarah Bell (1745–1819), moved the family a short distance to Elvington, 7 miles (11 km) southeast of York. Apart from a few details, little is known of their time in Elvington. Joshua's father was a blacksmith by trade, but he seems to have been pious by nature. The Industrial Revolution allowed the advancement of all sorts of radical new ideas in tandem with mechanical innovations. Religious, political, and social reformers took to the highways and byways spreading discontent with the status quo, John Wesley being one religious reformer whose message took hold in Yorkshire. His brand of fervent evangelical Methodism encouraged lay preachers, which appealed very much to the working classes. Evidently, the Routledges of Elvington, including Joshua, were receptive to Wesley's teachings. They joined the movement as active members of the York Circuit, and according to an account by J. D. Greenhalgh published in 1882, William Routledge was among a list of \"Wesleyan Methodist ministers admitted...in the year 1800.\""

Running for the University of Texas, El Paso he won three straight NCAA Championships 1975-1977. His 1976 win set the Franklin Field record that stood for 32 years. He was part of the controversial beginning wave of imported, older Kenyan athletes who allowed UTEP and Washington State University to dominate NCAA distance running. At the time, Craig Virgin suggested these athletes displaced opportunities for American athletes. Another star athlete mentioned was Washington State's Henry Rono who succeeded Munyala as NCAA Champion, with Munyala as runner-up, in 1978, blocking his attempt to win four straight. Later in 1978, Rono and Munyala went 1-2 for Kenya at both the African Games and the Commonwealth Games. Munyala won the Indoor Mile for UTEP in 1978 and is in the university's Hall of Fame when they ran the triple crown of the Men's Indoor, Outdoor and Cross Country Championships all in the same year."

  "text" : "John Bunion (J.B.) Murray (1908–1988) was a self-taught artist in Glascock County, Georgia. Murray was an illiterate sharecropper who, after a religious vision while working the fields at the age of 70, produced a remarkable body of abstract paintings in the last decade of his life. His work is now in many important collections, including that of the American Folk Art Museum and the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and has been featured in many museum exhibitions, including \"Self-Taught Genius\" at AFAM and \"When the Stars Begin to Fall\" at the Studio Museum. Murray's paintings are paradoxical in light of the limitations of his circumstances. Unable to read or write, in his pictures Murray invented a private language of notation, as if it were Adamic script from the late-20th century. While one might expect a septuagenarian sharecropper to create a style in a recognizable local vernacular, Murray's work, in its heightened color and abstract decorative quality, is comparable to modernist works with a mandarin appeal, by such artists as Paul Klee, Jean Dubuffet, and Howard Hodgkin, among others. Seeing an eagle descend from the sun, Murray believed that he had been granted a privileged religious insight, which was to be the inspiration for his work as an artist. Murray's revelation at the age of 70, which commenced his career as a painter, gave his work a prophetic intensity, as he believed himself a medium of God. Art historian Mary Padgelek, who wrote a book about Murray's life and works, has also written a musical about him: Visionary Man, being presented at the Hudson Mainstage Theater."

  "text" : "Jean Ewen (December 24, 1911 - 1987) was a Canadian nurse who worked with Chinese communist soldiers during the 1930s. Ewen was born in Scotland in 1911, but immigrated with her family to Canada as a child, where they settled in Saskatchewan. Ewen studied nursing in Winnipeg, graduating in 1931.In 1932, she moved to China to work as a medical missionary with the Franciscan Fathers, and learned Mandarin. Following a brief return to Canada in 1937, Ewen accompanied Doctor Norman Bethune when he came to China to offer medical aid to the communist forces, serving as his interpreter and assistant. Ewen came from a family of communist supporters, but she was opposed to mixing politics and medicine. In her memoir China Nurse 1932–1939, she described the horrors of front-line surgery during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In addition to nursing the wounded, she trained nurses and \"barefoot doctors\" and taught sanitation, for which the Chinese government awarded her the Silver Shield. Ewen eventually left China, travelling south to Hong Kong, and returned to Canada. Shortly after her return, she married John Kozar, a friend of her two brothers when they served in the Spanish Civil War. They had two children, Laura and Tom (though Laura was conceived while Ewen was still in China, and was born just after Kozar and Ewen were married). Kozar was killed when his ship was sunk in 1942, and Ewen subsequently married Mike Kovitch in 1946, with whom she had a third child, Michael. China Nurse, Ewen's memoir, was published in 1981. In later editions, it was called Canadian Nurse in China. Ewen died in 1987, and her ashes were returned to China in 1988."

Dunn Hunter claimed to be ignorant of his birthplace and that he was taken prisoner with two other white children by Native Americans who either belonged to or were associated with the Kickapoo nation. Dunn Hunter lived with the Kickapoo until 1816 but he traveled widely during that time and received a good education at one point meeting Robert Owen in England. Not knowing his real name, Dunn Hunter took on the name of an English benefactor, one John Dunn. The \"hunter\" was later added due to his abilities in that field. Dunn Hunter arrived in Texas in 1825 and in December he was sent by Richard Fields to Mexico with the aim of negotiating for a Cherokee settlement in Texas. Dunn Hunter arrived in Mexico City on March 19, 1826 but regretfully returned to Texas April 1826 with news of his failure. Dunn Hunter and Fields then opened negotiations with Martin Parmer which culminated in the Fredonian Rebellion. The Cherokee repudiated the rebellion and ultimately it was decided that Fields and Hunter should be put to death. Dunn Hunter escaped but a Mexican militia headed by Peter Ellis Bean was tasked with tracking him down. Dunn Hunter was caught and executed in early February of 1827."

Johan Ullman grew up in Falun, and received his medical degree from the University of Gothenburg, and his specialist degree in anaesthesia and intensive care at the Linköping University Hospital. Ullman has developed a number of inventions, first and foremost related to ergonomics, injury prevention, medical technology, work environment and IT. In 1996, at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Ullman developed a method for measuring exposure to human whole-body impact on board high-speed boats. Today, the method is used internationally. This project was however cancelled as it \"risked to result in commercial outputs\", since some new technologies that Ullman had developed were shown to reduce shock exposure. US Navy - SOCOM and NAVSEA invited Ullman to continue his research in the US. Johan Ullman is, in 2013 responsible for ergonomics (human factors), and injury prevention at HSBO Pro, a group of experts in design and acquisition of high speed boats, which also stages the HSBO Forum, a biannual international networking event for professionals in the high-speed work boat community."

  "text" : "Joel Kline  (born 1939) is an American real estate speculator who testified against several prominent Maryland politicians, and subsequently entered one of Maryland's longest bankruptcy proceedings. Kline employed a method of using public stock offerings to finance speculative land development deals. The stock purchases and land purchases were also funded by a series of loans secured by close-tied investors which included Maryland Roads Commissioner Walter Bucher, Agnew aide J. Walter Jones, Lester Matz, United States Senator Mike Gravel, Gerald Freeman, and insuranceman Maury Young. In 1969, Maryland Governor Marvin Mandel appointed Kline to The Maryland Industrial Development Financing Authority, an agency to distribute loans for public-private development projects. In 1971, Governor Mandel proposed Kline to a board investigating state banks, then filled the position of Maryland Banking Commissioner. In November, Lt. Governor Blair Lee III had to repay $25,00 in loans and $9,000 in expenses from using the personal office of Kline during his 1970 campaign. The publication of the questionable ties to loans caused Kline to lose his position as banking commissioner. Kline had also contributed maximum amounts to Lee through his interests in Prince Georges Land Investment and Development Inc, Penn Metal Fabricators, and Montgomery Land Investment and Development Inc. Lee acquired the finances to repay the loans through Kline-owned firms, and Leonard Blondes, who was indicted for bribery and conspiracy. According to an SEC investigation in 1972, Kline was taking out large poorly secured loans from the American National Bank of Maryland and Madison National Bank to pay off other loan debts. Kline claimed to have redirected money to Spiro Agnew when he was the Governor of Maryland, and to Baltimore County Executive Dale Anderson, in exchange for political favors. Maryland Attorney General Stephen Sachs gave Kline immunity from criminal prosecution in exchange for information that assisted the investigation of Spiro Agnew, who would resign in 1973. Kline served four months of a six-month sentence in a prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, for conspiracy to obstruct justice, and was frequently held with Watergate witnesses at Fort Holabird for interrogations to provide testimony. In 1974, Joel Kline, Eric Adolph Baer and Donald Harrison Abrams were indicted in connection with their efforts to obstruct the SEC investigation into price manipulation of over-the-counter stocks of Penn Metal Fabrications, Inc., U.S. Vinyl Corp. and Montgomery Land Investment and Development Corporation. The commission noted attempts to convince false testimony and destruction of evidence. Kline was sentenced to 20 months in jail and a $10,000 fine. Kline operated land holding partnerships across Maryland. Some included the Prince Georges Land Development and Investment Company, Rte. 108 Property Partnership in Howard County, and the Victory Farm in Gaithersburg. Lawyers and trustees Eugene M Feinnblatt and Lawrence D. Coppel spent 19 years pursuing assets of Kline in bankruptcy court after the judge declared there were no assets to return to creditors. In June 1992, Kline was indicted for tax fraud in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In 1977, Kline and three other World Trade Center architects, Irving Gershon, Howard Lazar, and Sy J. Miller, testified again under immunity for funneling money in an early 1970s tax evasion scheme involving New York Architect Leo Kornblath and Xaviera Hollander."

  "text" : "Julie Verhoeven (born 16 May 1969) is a British illustrator and designer who has collaborated with brands such as Louis Vuitton, Versace and Peter Jensen. While she is recognised primarily for her work in fashion, she has also contributed illustrations to books, magazines and album covers. Her work has been widely exhibited, including at London's Hayward Gallery. She is a design academic at both Central Saint Martins and the Royal College of Art. With recurring retro references – particularly to the 1970s and pop culture – her illustrations have been described as \"whimsical\" and \"Rock & Roll meets rainbow\". The Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) noted that: \"Her drawings, sculptures, assemblages, installations and video combine a rawness, at times reminiscent of punk, with a bewildering sensuality and a strong sense of colour and texture\". In a 2008 interview, she said: \"For the moment I am doing artist/designer... I would like to be regarded as an artist eventually\". In 2012, the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) acquired a large archive of her work (over 100 illustrations) for its permanent collection."

  "text" : "John Michael Ingram (1 February 1931 – 13 June 2014) was an influential British menswear designer and retailer of the 1950s and '60s who founded the John Michael fashion brand, followed by a range of successful retail concepts, before establishing one of the first fashion forecasting agencies in the 1970s. He has also been credited as one of the pioneers behind the rise of the King's Road, Chelsea as a fashion destination. In an interview for the magazine Drapers, former Moss Bros managing director Manny Silverman described Ingram as: \"one of the leading commercially innovative retailers of the 1960s; always a leader, never a follower. Without him, the King's Road might never have happened\"."

Myles was born in Limerick, Ireland, and with his brother, George Myles came out to Sydney c.1839.Henry Parfitt, M.L.A., was a passenger in the same vessel. After staying a few months in Sydney the two brothers went to New Zealand, and settled at Kororareka – a town on the Bay of Islands, and one of the earliest British settlements in New Zealand. The country was very mountainous, the climate wet, and the life very rough, and they removed to what was then known as the Port Phillip District of New South Wales. After a short stay in Melbourne they finally decided to settle down at Geelong. They built a store, and commenced business in Corio street, which was then the principal business street of the little town. After several years, as the town extended, they built new premises at the corner of Moorabool and Ryrie streets, known for many years after as Myles's corner. Then the rush to the gold diggings at Ballarat took place, and Geelong was deserted by nearly all its male population The two brothers went too, but were unsuccessful. John Myles sold out his business, and invested his means in the building of a number of shops and houses in Geelong. He took an active part in the early constitutional struggles, and in every movement for the advancement of the colony and of the district in which he lived. Myles was a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Grant from December 1852 until the original Council was abolished in March 1856. Myles was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the Electoral district of South Grant from November 1856 to July 1861. Myles died in Durham Ox, Victoria on 12 July 1893."

  "text" : "Johann Gottlieb Jackschon (23 January 1846 – 10 July 1931) was an Australian cricket scorer. He served as scorer for the New South Wales cricket team at various times over a period of around 40 years. On several occasions, he took the innovative step of making a separate memorandum recording the number of balls faced and runs scored by each batsman off each bowler, unlike scoring in a conventional scorebook but similar to the modern linear system of scoring. Jackschon was born in Maust, in Teichland north of Cottbus, Spree-Neiße, Prussia (now in eastern Germany). He emigrated to Australia with his parents and two older sisters, arriving in Sydney in August 1852 on the brig Reiherstieg. The family settled in Grafton, about 600 kilometres (370 mi) north of Sydney. One of his sisters later married a police constable Henry Bassman; the other married Joseph Kempnich, who ran a sugar mill. In his earlier years, Jackschon played cricket as wicketkeeper for teams in Warwick and Albert, playing his first match at Yamba. He was honorary scorer for the New South Wales cricket team from around 1886 until around 1893, when he moved back to Grafton. He had an orange orchard at Carr's Creek, and he became secretary of the Grafton District cricket association. His father died in Grafton in 1897. He continued to return to Sydney to score important cricket matches, including Test matches. Lord Sheffield gave Jackschon a gold medal for scoring in matches played by an English touring team captained by WG Grace that Sheffield organised in 1891-2. A report in The Referee of the Jubilee match played between New South Wales and Victoria in 1906 mentioned that Jackschon had compiled a table of balls faced and runs scored by each batsman off each bowler, in a similar manner to the modern linear system of scoring used in the 1890s by John Atkinson Pendlington, and developed Bill Ferguson and Bill Frindall. After Jackschon moved back to Sydney in November 1904, he lived for some time in Mosman on the North Shore, and then moved to the Eastern Suburbs to be closer to the Sydney Cricket Ground . He underwent an operation for appendicitis in December 1911. He resumed his role as honorary scorer for New South Wales and then as official scorer from 1913. Affectionately nicknamed \"the Professor\" and occasionally \"Jacko\", \"General\" or \"Daddy\", he regularly occupied a seat in \"Veterans Corner\" in the Sydney Cricket Ground's pavilion, near the visitors dressing room, attending cricket or rugby matches for around 30 years. He is often referred to by his initials, J.G., and his first name is sometimes Anglicised as John. In some sources, his surname is given as Jackscohn or occasionally Jackson. The year of his birth is confused in some sources. He was reported to have celebrated his 74th birthday in January 1924, when he was probably 78, and was said to be variously 84 or 86 at his death in Bondi in July 1931, when he was probably 85. He was associated with the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows for many years. After a funeral at St. Clement's Church in Mosman, he was buried in the Northern Suburbs cemetery. He was survived by his widow, Sarah, and a sister, Mrs Kempnich."

James earned his master's degree in theology in 1317 and was elected superior of the Dominican Province of France in 1318, a position he held until his death in 1321. In the course of his short academic career, James authored commentaries on multiple books of the Old and New Testaments and produced some 1,500 sermons. His oeuvre has yet to be critically edited, although numerous manuscripts and several early modern printed editions are still extant. James was a disciple of Peter Paludanus and wrote on original sin, arguing against Durandus of Saint-Pourçain that original sin was privation of original justice."

  "text" : "Joseph Thomas Jewell, Sr., known as J. Thomas Jewell (March 6, 1909 – December 10, 1993), was a Democrat from New Roads in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, who served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1936 to 1968. In the 1960-1964 term, the second tenure of Governor Jimmie Davis, he was the House Speaker. Jewell was a delegate to the 1960 Democratic National Convention, which met in Los Angeles, California, to nominate the Kennedy-Johnson ticket, an easy winner in the race for Louisiana's then ten electoral votes in the general election against Republican nominee Richard M. Nixon and a slate of unpledged electors, including future Governor David C. Treen. Speaker Jewell, as did most elected officials in the Deep South at the time, opposed school desegregation. On November 14, 1960, six days after the election of John F. Kennedy as president, Jewell told his legislative colleagues: The courts are traditionally the guardian of liberty. They have the right to pass upon the actions of the lawmakers of Louisiana and every other state. They can render opinions regarding the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress itself. But no power on earth – including the federal court – can assume unto itself the right to prejudge the actions of the Legislature. Jewell and his wife, the former Dorothy Morgan (1909-2008), had a son, J. Thomas Jewell, Jr. (1937-2002), who died of pancreatic cancer at his residence in New Roads. The junior Jewell was retired as a landman for the Warren American Oil Company in Tulsa, Oklahoma."

  "text" : "Johan Christian Ackermann (1740–1795) was a Swedish landscape gardener who was inspired by English landscape gardens. Johan Christian Ackermann was originally from Sachsen and came to Sweden when he was 22 years old. At first he became employed at the garden in Ekolsund. After a dispute with the employer he decided to open his own market garden. Ackermann became later the director of the royal gardens at Karlberg Palace. In the year 1785 he took over the leadership of the continued construction of Haga Park from his predecessor Fredrik Magnus Piper. During the years 1787-1790 Ackermann worked with channels, islets and up to the year 1800, about 26,000 trees were planted which were cultivated at the two garden centers of the Haga Park.

While in Liberia, Brabazon encountered South African mercenary Nick du Toit and hired him as his bodyguard. Brabazon’s memoir My Friend the Mercenary recounts his experiences of the Liberian civil war, his friendship with du Toit, and du Toit’s subsequent role in the failed Equatorial Guinea coup attempt. In 2013 Brabazon produced the HBO documentary Which Way Is The Frontline From Here? The Life and Time of Tim Hetherington. The documentary tells the story of photographer Tim Hetherington, Brabazon's friend and collaborator, who was killed while reporting on the Libyan Civil War in April 2011. The documentary was shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature."

  "text" : "Jagannath Kaushal (23 April 1915 – 31 May 2001) was an Indian National Congress Politician and a Union Law Minister from 1982 to 1985. He studied law at Panjab University, Lahore, in 1936 and started legal practice at Patiala in 1937. Though he was selected as the District and Sessions Judge in 1947, he resigned from the post in 1949 after the State was merged with PEPSU, and returned to legal practice. He was elected to the 1st Rajya Sabha in 1952, and was designated as the Senior Advocate in the Supreme Court in 1954. Following the merger of PEPSU with Punjab in 1956, he shifted to Chandigarh and commenced practice at the Punjab and Haryana High Court. He was also elected president of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association in 1962. After his retirement from the Rajya Sabha in 1964, Kaushal was appointed the Advocate-General of Punjab. In 1966, he was appointed the Additional Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, but he returned to the Bar nine months after resigning from the post. In 1967, he became the Advocate-General of Punjab and the Haryana Advocate-General a little later. During that period, he had the opportunity of conducting Indira Gandhi’s election petition in the Supreme Court when she was unseated. An expert in civil and criminal law, he was the Governor of Bihar between 1976 and 1979. Thereafter, he resigned to resume his practice. In 1980, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Chandigarh and remained the Union Law Minister from 1982 to 1985. He also ran successfully for Congress, winning his local seat again in 1985. A member of the Syndicate of Panjab University for over 25 years, Kaushal was the chairman of the Privileges Committee of the Lok Sabha. As the Law Minister, he attended the final session of the UN Conference on Laws of Seas held in Jamaica and signed the treaty on behalf of India. He was also the Governor of Bihar from June 1976 to Jan 1979. In the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the work was suspended for the whole day, on the day he expired, as a mark of respect to him."

  "text" : "June Curry (February 8, 1921 - June 16, 2012), also known as “The Cookie Lady”, lived in Afton, Virginia, alongside the TransAmerica Trail, a cross-country bicycle route mapped by Adventure Cycling Association in 1976. For more than 35 years, Curry offered food, lodging, water and showers to cyclists passing through her town. Curry – who was born in Afton and lived her entire life in the same house – came unexpectedly to her role as benefactor. Afton is at the top of a steep ascent, and during the inaugural Bikecentennial ride in 1976, she and her father encountered many tired cyclists in search of food and other provisions. In Curry’s words, “I decided it was easier to feed them than to put them up!” Early on, Curry provided home-baked cookies to her visitors, which earned for her her nickname, “The Cookie Lady”. Curry owned another residence close to her own house, which eventually she set aside for the use of cyclists. The building, which became known variously as “The Bike House”, “The Bike Museum” or “The Cookie House”, accumulated an impressive collection of photographs, scrapbooks and other mementos of and from cyclists who had passed through. Curry was also the subject of an episode of Charles Kuralt’s \"On the Road\" segment of CBS Sunday Morning. It has been estimated that more than 14,000 cyclists visited with Curry over the years. In 2005, Curry suffered a stroke and, thanks to donations from cyclists and cycling organizations who had learned of her misfortune, was able to hire a caregiver. In recognition of Curry’s years of generosity, Adventure Cycling Association in 2003 established the June Curry Trail Angel Award to honor “a generous individual or group encountered during a bicycle tour that makes the cyclotourist’s journey easier or possible by helping the cyclist through an act of goodwill.” Curry was the award’s first recipient."

  "text" : "John Guthrie (1905 – 1955), real name John Brodie, was a New Zealand journalist and novelist from New Plymouth who moved to London in 1938. He wrote several novels about New Zealand and New Plymouth. He was born in New Plymouth and educated at New Plymouth Boys' High School, and at Canterbury University College (BA and Diploma in Journalism). While studying at Canterbury College aged 26 he broke a leg in a rugby accident which subsequently had to be amputated; he had been regarded as a potential All Black to represent New Zealand. He wrote his first novel The Little Country about pioneer life in 19th century New Plymouth while recovering in bed from the rugby accident. With Paradise Bay they are regarded as New Zealand classics, with the English critic Marghanita Laski saying that Paradise Bay was \"an excellent book and a potential New Zealand classic if ever there was one\". However Paradise Bay has been called \"thin and contrived\" by comparison with his first novel. The novel The Seekers was filmed in 1954 as The Seekers. As with The Little Country the novels were controversial in New Plymouth as some locals thought they recognised themselves in the novels. He moved to London in 1938, and in World War II was an Intelligence Officer in the Royal Air Force. Postwar in London he edited Books of Today then was assistant editor of World's Press News. He married his American wife Elinor Roddam in 1952, they had no children. While returning from a 10 weeks' visit to New Zealand he died at sea from coronary thrombosis on the liner Rangitikei after departure from Southampton. The Times said (inaccurately, as he was returning from New Zealand): \"Mr John Brodie, a New Zealand novelist who wrote under the pen name \"John Guthrie\" died at sea suddenly on Monday evening at the age of 49 while returning to New Zealand.\""

The Johnnie Colemon Theological Seminary is named in her honor. Colemon was born in Centerville, Alabama on February 18, 1920 but her family moved to Columbus, Mississippi at an early age, and she identified more with that location as her birthplace, leading others to misidentify Columbus, Mississippi as her place of origin. She attended Union Academy High School and graduated from Wiley College with a Bachelor of Arts in 1943. She then taught at schools in Mississippi and Chicago. Colemon was ordained as a Unity Minister in 1956 and promptly founded Christ Universal Temple, a Chicago-based megachurch. In 1974 Colemon founded the Universal Foundation for Better Living, \"an international association of Bible-based New Thought Christian churches, centers, and study groups.\" She received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1987. Colemon retired in 2006. She died on December 23, 2014 at the age of 94."

Riepel is known for his theoretical work, especially for his innovations in theory of melody and form. Riepels writings form one of the foundations for the theory of composition of the later 18th century. He was violin teacher to František Xaver Pokorný. Riepel was the son of a farmer and innkeeper. He attended the Jesuit College in Steyr and began philosophical studies in Linz and Graz, but distinguished himself early on as a violinist. 1735-1736 he toured the Balkan Peninsula as valet of General Alexander Graf d'Ollone in the 7th Austrian war against the Turks. 1739-1745 he lived in Dresden, where he claims to have regularly frequented Jan Dismas Zelenka and the concertmaster Johann Georg Pisendel had by his own admission and received his first real musical training here. After living in Poland and Vienna, in 1749 he was band master at the court of the Princes of Thurn and Taxis in Regensburg, where he spent the rest of his life and created his theoretical writings and the majority of his compositions ."

In 1988 he became a student of Amsterdam University, where he graduated in East European Studies with major topics in Slavistics and musicology. He continued his studies in Poland at Warsaw University and worked at the Warsaw Autumn festival for contemporary music. In 1997 he became a Polish translator and interpreter in the Netherlands. In 1996 he started working on an artificial North Slavic language, Vuozgašchai (Vozgian), and in 2002 he created another language, Wenedyk, a reconstruction of what Polish might have looked like if it had been influenced by Vulgar Latin. In 2006 he was one of the initiators of the Pan-Slavic language Slovianski (later renamed Interslavic), as well as the coordinator of a project for the creation of an electronic Interslavic dictionary. In November 2013, he was awarded the Josef Dobrovský medal for his 'contributions to Slavic culture and science'. Van Steenbergen lives in IJmuiden. He is married and has three children."

In 2013 he broke the record for the overall fastest known time for a thru hike of the Pacific Crest Trail, which traverses the West Coast of the United States from Campo, at the Mexican border, to Manning Park in British Columbia. Garrett started the 2663 mile hike on June 10, 2013, and finished on August 8, achieving the record with a time of 59 days, 8 hours and 14 minutes, averaging 45 miles per day. He was the first person to hike the trail in under 60 days. He held the record for the fastest known time until August 10, 2014. Garrett hiked to raise money for the charity group Mercy for Animals, his hike being described in the press as a \"mission\" for the animals. In media interviews about his record Garrett spoke mostly about his cause. He told National Public Radio, \"We don’t need to eat meat or any animal products in order to be healthy or in order to be strong, and I just wanted to go out there and prove that -- and I hope I did.”  When the Los Angeles radio station, KNX, named Garrett their \"hero of the week,\" Garrett said in the segment, \"I did it to raise awareness that this sort of feat of endurance could be powered by a vegan diet… No matter how hard it was I just kept reminding myself that what I was going through was nothing compared to what animals are going through on factory farms.\" Garrett was born in Los Angeles in 1982. He attended and competed for Santa Monica College in 2001, placing in the state's top 10 for the 1500-meter run. He has a Master's Degree in Exercise Science from Long Beach State University and works as an exercise physiology teacher and cross country coach at Santa Monica College."

  "text" : "John Hayward (1819 – March 13, 1885) was a lawyer, judge and politician in Newfoundland. He served in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1852 to 1866. He was born and educated in Harbour Grace. He studied law with George Henry Emerson and was called to the Newfoundland bar in 1841. He served as chief clerk and registrar for the northern circuit court and as sub-collector of customs at Harbour Grace. In 1849, John and his young family headed for Washington County in Wisconsin. They traveled during a week and a half. They took a boat from Newfoundland to New York, then up the canals to Albany, another boat to Buffalo. They traveled to Wisconsin by wagon and bought a farm and had land cleared. After a few months, in a letter to his father-in-law, he seems full of optimism. In spite of that, he was back in Harbour Grace at the end of 1850, and was sub-collector of Customs in 1851. He was elected to the assembly for Conception Bay in 1852 and for Harbour Grace in 1855 and again in 1859. He served as Solicitor General in the provincial cabinet until 1861. The results of the 1861 election in Harbour Grace were set aside due to violence at the polls; Hayward was re-elected in a by-election held later that year. He was elected again in 1865 and was named Solicitor General again. Hayward was opposed to the union with Canada proposed in 1866. He retired from politics in August of that year and was named an assistant justice in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland. Hayward retired from the bench due to illness in 1884 and died the following year."

Gerritsen is President of the Maine-based national trade organization Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association (OSGATA). In March 2011, Gerritsen and other farmers filed a lawsuit (OSGATA et al v. Monsanto)  against Monsanto Corporation to prevent it from suing farmers who have been contaminated by their genetically modified seeds for patent infringement. In January 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear OSGATA et al v. Monsanto, effectively ending the case. However, American farmers gained partial protection with the ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. which had issued an estoppel, ordering Monsanto not to sue farmers for patent infringement should they become contaminated by trace amounts of Monsanto's patented seed technology. In November 2011, the Utne Reader named Gerritsen an \"Organic Food Champion\" and one of the magazine's \"world visionaries\" for that year. Gerritsen has connected the message of Occupy Wall Street to the loss of family farms and spoke at the Occupy Farmers March in New York City in December 2011. In January 2014, Gerritsen participated in the first ever Agrarian Elders Conference in Big Sur, CA. On Mother Earth Day 2014, Gerritsen spoke about the superiority of organic farming systems before the United Nations in New York City as a panel member of the 4th Interactive Dialogue of the General Assembly."

  "text" : "Johann Georg Danninger (died 1848) was an Austrian bronzesmith, known for making many of the bronze items that decorated the Viennese court of the Austrian Empire in the 19th century. Danninger had made items for the court since 1801 and received the court commission (Hoftitel) in 1811. He made mirror fittings and decorative items for the court. By the 1840s, he was heavily indebted, which he attributed to increasing foreign competition and the burden of having to care for his mentally ill son. In 1844, Emperor Francis I agreed to buy a centrepiece from Danninger in order to save his business from imminent bankruptcy. Nonetheless, Danninger's house and business were sold at auction prior to his death in 1848, and were likely taken over by the originally English firm of John Morton und Sohn."

  "text" : "Joan Olive Robinson Hill (February 6, 1931 – March 19, 1969) was a socialite and equestrian from Houston, Texas. Her unexplained death at age 38 led to her husband, John Hill, becoming the first person to be indicted by the state of Texas on the charge of murder by omission. The case precipitated a series of events that included the 1972 murder of John Hill and, two years later, the fatal police shooting of the man accused of that murder. Adopted as an infant by wealthy oil tycoon Davis \"Ash\" Robinson and his wife, Rhea, Joan became an equestrian at a young age. She excelled and continued the sport into adulthood, ultimately winning several national titles. After two youthful marriages that ended in divorce, Joan married plastic surgeon John Hill in 1957. After a tumultuous marriage, she died following a short illness on March 19, 1969. Autopsy examinations failed to determine a cause of death beyond an infection from an unknown source. Ash subsequently accused John of poisoning Joan, and petitioned the district attorney to prosecute John for murder. John's murder trial was held in February 1971 but ended in a mistrial. As a second trial was approaching, John was gunned down by an intruder at his home. A suspect, Bobby Wayne Vandiver, was arrested and indicted for the murder, but was killed in a shootout with police before his trial. Two other suspects, Marcia McKittrick and Lilla Paulus, were convicted as accomplices to John's murder and served time in prison. The case was the subject of Thomas Thompson's 1976 book Blood and Money and the 1981 made-for-television film Murder in Texas."

  "text" : "Julia Althea Carter Preston (26 January 1926–6 January 2012) was a British potter who was responsible for reviving the art of sgraffito (where designs are scratched on to ceramics) in the United Kingdom in the 1950s. Born in Liverpool, the youngest of four daughters of the sculptor Edward Carter Preston and his wife Marie (née Tyson Smith), a watercolourist and the sister of the sculptor Herbert Tyson Smith, Julia Carter Preston attended Blackburne House School for Girls and the Liverpool Institute High School for Girls. While studying at the Liverpool College of Art in the 1940s she discovered a passion for ceramics and chose to specialise in pottery, passing her pottery examination and gaining a National Diploma in Art in 1951. Following this, Carter Preston taught ceramics at several colleges in Liverpool and became Head of Ceramics and taught pottery at the Liverpool College of Art when John Lennon and Stuart Sutcliffe were students there. She held this post until the mid-1970s. During the 1960s she worked for a period as Wedgwood's official lecturer in the north-west. In 1960 she married Michael Pugh Thomas, a marine biologist and environmental scientist. There were no children of the marriage. Examples of Julia Carter Preston’s work were presented to Princess Margaret and the Duchess of Kent when they made official visits to Liverpool. Another piece was commissioned as a present for the Prince of Wales when he visited the newly restored St George’s Hall in the city in 2007. An exhibition of her work was held at the Walker Art Gallery in 1999; this was opened by Antiques Roadshow expert Tim Wonnacott, who is an enthusiastic collector of her work. Carter Preston was made a Fellow of Liverpool John Moores University in 2005. Her work is represented in the Walker Art Gallery, the Liverpool University Art Gallery, the York Art Gallery, the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. After the death of her husband in March 2011 she lived in a nursing home near to her former home in Canning Street. Her own collection of her ceramics was donated to Liverpool Hope University where a trust has been set up to preserve the collection and support student bursaries."

He began his film career as a production supervisor. In the late 1930s, he joined MGM as a unit manager and worked on the Dr. Kildare series and other films. After his success with short films (the two Academy Awards, and three other nominations), he began to work on features, producing such films as Richard Fleischer's The Vikings in 1958, Sam Peckinpah's Major Dundee (1965) and the James Bond Casino Royale in 1967, and his final film, Pussycat, Pussycat, I Love You. It was the post-production interference at Columbia Pictures on Major Dundee which for a time gave Bresler a reputation as a studio hatchet-man. The more complicated history of the production has become known over the years, and the editing of the film is seen as one part of that history. In 1965, he was a member of the jury at the 15th Berlin International Film Festival."

  "text" : "Johann Andreas Benjamin Nothnagel (1729–1804) was a German Jewish painter who painted famous paintings of Jewish rabbis and leaders. A portrait of an artist, thought to be his self portrait, is found in the Nagler Exhibition. Some of this artist's paintings have become identified with famous rabbis from decades before his time, for which he drew imaginary portraits. Copies and sketches of his pictures and etchings have been attributed to the images of various rabbis, sometimes the same image serving for two different people. They have been printed in Jewish history books, and in the past 100 years or so have become part of the Sukkah ornaments, with the writing of Isaiah's prophecy (30:20) '...and your eyes shall see those who show you the way'. Some of his art was stolen by Nazi Germany. The Israel Museum exhibits one such picture, retrieved from the Nazi plunder, but which the details of are now obscure. Another, of Rabbi Naphtali Katz (Cohen Zedek) is shown at the Jewish Museum in Frankfurt, Germany. Cropped and reversed on a vertical axis, this image became identified with the rabbi, who fled the town after he was arrested and falsely accused of burning down the crowded Jewish section of Frankfurt. He had been released after proved innocent in trial, but still held to blame by the Christian public, documented in antisemitic writings, accusations later replicated by the Jewish Haskallah movement, and even modern day Researchers His picture of a bearded man (probably depicting a German rabbi) is thought to be \"a type more than a picture\"."

Encouraged by her mother, she sang and performed in the theater from a young age; she went on to become a famous leading lady and made several performances on Broadway. Later she became a director, managing many stock companies, directing Broadway productions and training many young performers who went on to be famous actors. In 1925 she founded her own theater in Detroit. Reorganized in 1928 as the Detroit Civic Theatre, it was one of America's first civic theaters, and her methods influenced community theater projects elsewhere. She has been described as \"one of the pioneering women stage directors in the early twentieth century\"."

  "text" : "Josefina de la Torre Millares (1907–2002) was a Spanish poet, novelist, and opera singer, as well as a stage, film, radio, and television actress. She was closely associated with the Generation of '27, an influential group of poets including Ernestina de Champourcín, Juan José Domenchina, Concha Méndez and Carmen Conde, that arose in Spanish literary circles between 1923 and 1927, essentially out of a shared desire to experience and work with avant-garde forms of art and poetry. In 1934, de la Torre did work as a voice actress for Paramount, dubbing over Marlene Dietrich, and also dubbed Alexander Hall's Miss Fane's Baby Is Stolen (1934). She returned to Madrid in 1935, where she began concentrating on her theatrical and musical repertoire, becoming a successful soprano. In the 1940s, de la Torre gained a reputation as a stage actress at the Teatro Nacional, and also performed in films in the 1940s, several of which were under her brother, Claudio de la Torre. In 1946, the siblings and de la Torre's husband, actor Ramón Corroto, formed the theatre company, Compañía de Comedias Josefina de la Torre, which put on numerous plays, including productions of Miguel Mihura's El caso de la mujer asesinadita and Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House. She continued as a Madrid-based stage actress in the 1950s and 1960s, although she published two novels in 1954, En el umbral and Memories de una estrella. Despite her success in the Spanish-speaking countries, her poems were not translated into English until 2000 when a bilingual edition of Poemas de la Isla was published with translations of two volumes of her poetry by Carlos Reyes."

Jennings is notable for being one of the youngest publicly documented people to be identified as transgender, and for being the youngest person to become a national transgender figure. Jennings received national attention in 2007 when an interview with Barbara Walters aired on 20/20, which led to other high-profile interviews and appearances. Christine Connelly, a member of the board of directors for the Boston Alliance of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth (BAGLY), stated, \"She was the first young person who picked up the national spotlight, went on TV and was able to articulate her perspective and point of view with such innocence.\" Her parents noted that Jazz was clear on being female as soon as she could speak. Jennings is an honorary co-founder of the TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation, which she and her parents founded in 2007 to assist transgender youth. In 2013, she founded Purple Rainbow Tails, a company in which she fashions rubber mermaid tails to raise money for transgender children. Jennings hosts a series of YouTube videos about her life, titled \"I Am Jazz\", making her one of the youngest trans females in history to speak out on issues publicly. Jennings stars in the TLC reality TV series, I Am Jazz, which focuses on her life with her family as a teenager and as a transgender youth. The series premiered on July 15, 2015."

  "text" : "Doctor John Symonds Lyon Browne (April 13, 1904 – January 21, 1984) was an English-born Canadian physician. He was born in Wembley, London, the son of a civil engineer, and came to Canada with his family in 1905. In 1912, the family moved to Montreal. Browne was educated at Westmount High School and at McGill University. He went on to work in Germany, Austria and England under a travelling fellowship from the Royal Society of Canada. Browne returned to McGill as a research fellow, later becoming a professor of medicine, Medical Department chairman and director of the Royal Victoria Hospital. He was forced to leave those positions due to failing eyesight but served as chairman of the Department of Investigative Medicine from 1955 until his retirement in 1960. In 1964, he helped establish the Conseil du recherche medical du Quebec, later known as the Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec, and also helped found the Canadian Clinical Investigation Travel Club, later the Canadian Society for Clinical Investigation. He is credited with contributing to important advances in endocrinology. During his time at McGill, he pressed for the addition of more biochemistry and physiology in the undergraduate curriculum for clinical medicine. Browne was named to the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame in 1994 for his efforts to create co-operation between the English and French-speaking physicians of Quebec."

In 1993 he was named Indonesian ambassador the United Kingdom, a position which he held until 1997. In 2006 he was named Indonesian ambassador to the Netherlands. In September 2010 he had an interview with Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad in which he made several remarks about the Party for Freedom and the people who voted for it, amongst others saying that those voters might be suffering from a \"fear psychosis\". His remarks led to questions in the Dutch parliament by Party for Freedom MPs Geert Wilders and Wim Kortenoeven. In the questions they asked whether Dutch Foreign Ministers Maxime Verhagen was willing to call Habibie over to the Foreign Ministry, Verhagen however did not wish to do so, citing that the remarks were made in freedom of speech and that Habibie had already retracted his words. Another incident occurred when Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono cancelled his planned visit to the Netherlands for October 2010. Indonesia decided to cancell after it received information that the President might be arrested due to a court complaint made by the government-in-exile of the Republic of South Maluku of human rights violations. Habibie's term as ambassador ended late 2010. He died, aged 74, from heart problems at the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Central Jakarta. He had had bypass surgery two times before."

She married the art historian Roy Strong on 10 September 1971, at Wilmcote church, near Stratford-upon-Avon, with a special licence from the Archbishop of Canterbury. She was 41 and her husband 35. They lived at Much Birch, Herefordshire, where they made one of Britain's largest post-war formal gardens, The Laskett. In 1995 they commissioned the artist Jonathan Myles-Lea to paint a 'portrait' of the house and gardens and the painting The Laskett was completed the same year. She and Strong also wrote books together. She appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 18 December 1971, and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1986.

Before he became a journalist, Foley was an instructor for Teach For America. In 2009, he became an embedded journalist with USAID-funded development projects in Iraq, and in 2011 he wrote for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes in Afghanistan, and GlobalPost in Libya. There, he was captured by Gaddafi loyalist forces and held for 44 days. The next year, James Foley was captured in Syria while he was working for Agence France-Presse and GlobalPost."

He became champion of Montréal (16 years old), of the province of Québec and of Canada (18 years old). Several memorables bouts including a 1940 win over Johnny Greco despite giving away 15 pounds. Joe Gagnon also defeated Gerry Blanchard, Fernando Gagnon and Danny Webb. One of the eight losses by decision of the referee came against future world welterweight and midleweight champion Sugar Ray Robinson, who was visiting Montréal in 1938. Gagnon went the distance, but suffering a badly cut lip in the opening round. It was the first defeat in an international bout on the continent. Turning pro, he fought four times before retiring of boxing. In 1957, he was named boxing coach at Palestre Nationale of Montréal."

  "text" : "Jason Dottley (born December 30, 1980 in Memphis, Tennessee) is an American television and stage actor, recording artist and producer. Dottley was married to American film director, producer, television writer and playwright, Del Shores October 26, 2003. The couple divorced in 2013. Their divorce caused shockwaves through the gay community. After his divorce from Del Shores, Dottley dated famed Israeli journalist and anchor for Logo TV CBS News, Itay Hod  about whom he wrote his record \"It's Our Night\". For the most part of 2012 through 2014, he focused on taking care of his ailing grandmother at her home in Florida until she died July 6, 2014. In 2003, he made his professional acting debut in a production of Terrance McNally's “Lisbon Traviata” at the Actor’s Lab in Hollywood, CA. His performance was reviewed \"Letter-perfect\" by the LA Times. The world was introduced to Dottley in 2008, in his most notable-to-date starring role as Ty Williamson in \"Sordid Lives: The Series\", from IMG Global and Viacom via cable's LOGO Logo TV in the United States and is now available to view on HULU. Sordid Lives aired internationally in 17 countries around the world starring icons Rue McClanahan, Caroline Rhea, Olivia Newton-John, Leslie Jordan and Delta Burke. Dottley also appeared in a national tour of the stage production of Sordid Lives. In 2015, Dottley began his 40+ city tour with his first full length one-man show \"Life on the gAy-List\". Jason doesn't hold back about life when you are gay, divorced and over 30. Dubbed the \"poster boy for marriage\" turned the \"public face for gay divorce\", Dottley details celebrity adventures, heartbreak, and every funny and regrettable decision in between. He co-wrote and co-produced the one man show with playwright and producer, Eric Rittenhouse. His success and recent activity landed him recognition as a comedy \"Pick of the Week\" in the Boston Globe on July 1, 2015. Dottley is also an award-winning theatre producer. In 2010, Dottley produced \"Yellow\" at the Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood which won him the most prestigious Los Angeles Drama Critic's Circle \"Best World Premiere Play\" Award. He has produced and starred in major national tours with icons Rue McClanahan, Delta Burke, Caroline Rhea and Georgette Jones.

He has also had the honor of producing and starring in the Delta Burke and Leslie Jordan show, headlined Southern Baptist Sissies/Sordid Lives National Tour. The tour placed at #105 on Billboard's Concert Boxscore Chart grossing over $150,000 in 2 days. Dottley is a proud member of both professional performing artist’s organizations SAG-AFTRA and Actor’s Equity. His recording career has led him to become a 3-time Top 25 Billboard (US) recording artist & Top 10 (UK) ElectroPop Star. His first release was \"Party Round the World\", in March of 2010. \"Party Round the World\" hit #19 on Billboard, and was followed by \"Pop It\", then \"It's Our Night\", which all rose to the Top 25 on Billboard (US). \"Pop It\" became a Top 10 UK smash hit. \"It's Our Night\" was released in the Summer of 2013 and quickly became his 3rd Top 25 Billboard record. \"It's Our Night\", is a catchy, memorable, power-pop hit. The song completed an 11 week run on Billboard, became his first UK Top 20 Pop hit single, and was a Top 20 UK Pop summer hit. Dottley then released the theme song he wrote for his \"Love Story Project\" appropriately titled \"Love Story\" in 2013. The song was not promoted to radio or clubs, the first \"fan offering\" in Dottley's career. Valentine's Day in 2015 found Dottley celebrating the 30-year anniversary of Madonna’s song “Crazy For You”, by releasing his own cover and wildly controversial music video re-interpretation of the iconic Madonna (entertainer) love ballad from the 1980's. All records combined, Dottley has spent over 44 weeks on U.S. Billboard's Charts. his newest hit, \"Cocaine and Whiskey\" is wildly infectious, and that has been proven week after week with each new Top 40 national radio add it receives. The song sits on the playlists of WAZO 107.5 North Carolina, 105.9 WILN Florida, and KISR 93.7 Arkansas to name a few, playing in between Taylor Swift, One Direction, Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, and The Weeknd. Dottley is currently on tour promoting the successful new chart hit. The world-record setting music video for \"Cocaine and Whiskey\" features some of the most expensive and rare exotic luxury cars in the world, valued between $15M and $20M. The list includes: a McLaren 650, the Lamborghini Aventador, the Bentley GTR-3, the Rolls Royce Ghost, the Ferrari 458, the Lamborghini Huracán, the Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, and three tricked out Porsche GT3s. Dottley was a proud member of 2008's Out 100 Most Influential People in GLBT culture with Katy Perry and Guillermo Diaz (actor). The list is compiled by Out Magazine (International) yearly, and presents the 100 most influential people in LGBT culture. His work for gay rights, Out 100 status, and his year after year successes, has made him a \"Superstar in the GLBT community.\"  In 2012, the National Don't H8 organization awarded Jason with the National recognition as the \"King of Don't H8\" a forever title for the National system, where he reigns with Queen of Don't H8, American Idol's Kimberly Caldwell."

  "text" : "Joey Welz (born 1940) is an American musician born in Baltimore, Maryland who is best known for his tenure as pianist with Bill Haley and His Comets. He was born Joseph Welzant on March 17, 1940 to Melba, a teacher and concert pianist and Joseph, a Baltimore city police officer. Joey started his music career with his group The Jay Rockers in the 1950s. Joey was amongst the first group of rock and roll pianists to start using the boogie-woogie style with his left hand. He attributes this to the lack of a bassist in his band, forcing him to play basslines using his left hand. In interviews he has stated that it also came in handy when he joined the Comets because the notes coming from the upright bass were often inaudible due to the limits of amplification at that time. He attracted the attention of Bill Haley when The Jay Rockers opened for The Comets. While serving as a recording engineer for the Armed Forces Network in Berlin, Joey recorded and co-produced a live session for Bill Haley and His Comets for AFN Frankfurt. This was the first occasion that Joey played on a Bill Haley and His Comets record, providing backing vocals on \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" and playing on \"Honky Tonk\". This session was released years later on Hydra Records. Upon exiting the military in 1963, Joey joined the Comets as pianist following the departure of Johnny Grande. It was also during this time that Joey signed a record deal with Canadian-American Records and released the single \"Hey Little Moonbeam\" which he co-wrote with Steve Lawrence. He would continue to play with The Comets until 1966. In 1969 Joey recorded an album entitled \"Listen To The Voices\" with Link Wray which was released on Music City Records.

  "text" : "Jennie Dorcas Fellows (April 4, 1873 – October 10, 1938), also known as Dorcas Fellows and Dorkas Fellows, was an author and instructor of library cataloging at the New York State Library. Her book, Cataloging Rules, originally published in 1914 as bulletin 36 of the New York State Library School, remains in print in its many editions and formats. Fellows edited the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) from 1921 to 1937. She took over the 11th edition after the death May Seymour, but the first full edition that she issued was the 12th. This edition was 25% larger than the previous edition, and was well received. The 13th edition published in 1932, edited by Fellows, grew again by one-third, adding over four hundred pages and bringing the printed classification to 1,647 pages. Fellows embraced Melvil Dewey's spelling reform, and continued to published the classification using the reformed spelling standard. Letters sent between Fellows and Dewey were written in an even further reduced shorthand, such as: \"d n order paper. I l get tt i tym. Giv whn redi t order final decision o syz & weit.\" It was during this time that she also changed the spelling of her name from Dorcas to Dorkas, in accord with Dewey's spelling reform rules. In 1927, Fellows moved the DDC editorial offices from the Lake Placid Club to an office in the Library of Congress. Shortly afterward, Decimal Classification numbers began appearing on the Library of Congress cataloging cards that were sold to thousands of libraries for use in their catalogs. She died in 1938, while still working on the 14th edition of the classification."

When the state of Illinois was created in 1818, he co-authored its constitution and served in its first General Assembly as Speaker of the House.

  "text" : "John William Glover (19 June 1815 – 19 December 1899) was an Irish composer, conductor, organist, violinist, and teacher. Glover was born in Dublin, where he initially became an orchestral violinist as early as 1830. In 1848, he succeeded Haydn Corri as organist of St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral, Dublin, and also became professor of music at the Central Model Schools of the Board of National Education. An experienced choral conductor, he established the short-lived Choral Institute of Dublin in 1851. He presented a series of \"National Concerts\" in 1853 to commemorate Thomas Moore one year after the poet's death, and also co-organised and conducted large musical performances on the occasion of the centenaries of Daniel O'Connell (1875) and Thomas Moore (1879). As a composer, Glover was one of a handful of native composers who cultivated (classical) musical life in Dublin in the mid-19th century – and among these the only one of Roman Catholic denomination. A personal friend of the émigrés Michael William Balfe and William Vincent Wallace, he, too, was inclined towards opera, despite the incomparably more difficult circumstances in Ireland in this period. His most ambitious work was the three-act opera The Deserted Village (libretto by Edmund Falconer after Oliver Goldsmith's novel of the same name), performed in Dublin in 1880 and published in London. In it, \"Glover uses a very direct diatonic language that is not sentimental but speaks to his assured facility for setting words to music\", it was also described as a \"populist style\". To a very limited extent he makes use of Irish traditional music, but even so it is an important work in the canon of Irish national opera. Other large-scale works include the \"national oratorio\" St Patrick at Tara (1875), written for the O'Connell Centenary, and the cantata One Hundred Years Ago (1879) for the Moore Centenary. He also wrote a violin concerto (date unknown) Glover was also an expert on Irish traditional music. He lectured widely on this subject in Dublin, London, and Paris. Among his publications is one of the earliest collective volumes of Thomas Moore's Irish Melodies (to Glover's accompaniments, published by James Duffy, Dublin, 1859), and he collaborated with Patrick Weston Joyce, providing the piano accompaniments to his Ancient Irish Music (Dublin: McGlashan & Gill, 1873). Glover died in Dublin. He was the grandfather of Jimmy Glover, director of music at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, from 1893 to 1920."

Gautherin was born to a family of peasant farmers in Savault, a hamlet in the commune of Ouroux-en-Morvan. With the help of a local patron he studied in Paris, first at the Gobelins school for apprentices, followed by training in the atelier of Charles Gumery, and in 1864 he was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts. The following year his work was accepted at the Paris Salon where he exhibited annually until his death, although after winning medals in the Salons of 1868, 1870, and 1873, he exhibited hors de concours (out of competition). His first major success came in 1876 with a marble sculpture of Saint Sebastien, which led to commissions from the City of Paris, and the cathedrals of Marseille and Nevers. He was made a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in 1878. Gautherin died of a sudden illness in Paris at the age of 49 survived by his wife Anne-Marie (née Loué) whom he had married in 1883 and their three young children. Following his funeral at the Église Notre-Dame-des-Champs, he was buried in Montparnasse Cemetery."

  "text" : "Johannes Cardinalis von Bergreichenstein (Jan Kardinál z Rejnštejna) (circa 1375 — after 1428) was a Czech lawyer and diplomat. He was rector of Charles University in Prague 1416-1417. In 1394 he took up the study of law at the Charles University in Prague and received his doctorate at Jan Hus in 1404 to champion the seven liberal arts. 1407 was followed by the examination for Bachelor of laws. Two years later he was already as an envoy of King Wenceslas IV. together with Christian von Prachatitz and Peter de Mladoniovicz at the Council of Pisa in part. As followers of Jan Hus, they should provide for the repeal of the ban imposed against this church. A year later he defended Hus against the Archbishop of Prague Zbynko Zajíc of rabbit castle and accompanied Hus as a representative of the University, together with Peter for Mladoňovic, on his journey to the Council of Constance, where he received neither a prelate, nor the support of the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. After his return to Bohemia, he was appointed in 1417 as rector of the university. Under his leadership, became the symbol of the Hussites - the cup - cemented in the minds of scholars. John spread in his tenure, the laity -Teaching of Hus and protested his innocence and integrity. On 10 March 1417 he issued a proclamation in which the doctrine was confirmed as for all Christians. He sent this input even at the Council of Constance, which it saw the confirmation of the Bohemian heresy. The Pope went so far that he no longer recognized the University of Prague. During the Hussite wars he belonged together with Jan of Příbrami to the moderate wing, which sought a compromise with the Catholic Church. Because of his diplomatic skills were chosen cardinalis in 1421 as a member of a delegation that offered the Bohemian throne to the Polish king Władysław II Jagiełło. At the end of the year he was with John of Seelau, Jakobellus of Mies and Peter Payn to the administrators of the chalice teaching. Later they banished him from Prague. Already in 1425 he represented Prague in negotiations with the Taborites. The last written reference to him is dated 1428, when he held the office of Archbishop administrator."

(The marriage depicted is that of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany in 1882.) Charles T. Jacoby, brother of Sir James Alfred Jacoby, commissioned a series of five oil paintings illustrating the 'History of a Soldier of the Sixteenth Century' with the titles \"The Declaration of War,\" \"The Benediction,\" \"The Surrender,\" \"Victorious,\" and \"The Banquet.\" Linton was elected an associate in 1867 and a member in 1870 of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. He was president of the Royal Institute from 1884 to 1899 and then from 1909 until his death. In 1897 he won the Jubilee Medal."

  "text" : "Josh Michael Cartu (born March 11, 1979) is a Canadian Ferrari racecar driver, Ferrari club president, and business entrepreneur well known in auto racing circles in the US, Europe and Israel. Cartu dreamed of one day becoming an astronaut or a fighter pilot. When neither one of those came to fruition, he settled for the adrenaline rush that speeding on the ground had to offer by becoming a gentleman race car driver with Ferrari/AFCorse Racing. He currently trains with AF Corse Italia, which also includes Giancarlo Fisichella, Gianmaria Bruni, and Michele Rugolo. In 2012, he was invited to join the AFCorse Racing Team to train in the GT Sports Car Racing class. He later trained with the AFCorse team for the 2013 European Ferrari Challenge Cup and has been testing and training through 2015 in a Ferrari 458GT3 race car. For the 2016 season, he is scheduled to participate with the new AFCorse Ferrari 488GT3 developed by Italian race car designer Micheloto. Cartu  is a regular participant in race rallies, including the Mille Miglia, Targa Florio, Gumball 3000. In 2014, Cartu and his team \"Wolfpack\" won Gumball3000's 'Best Team Award'. They raised over $60,000 USD for charity and were once again awarded with Gumball3000's 'Best Team Award' in May 2016. In October 2014, Cartu was invited  by Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat to participate in the city's Formula 1 'Road Show for Peace' event. Racing on behalf of AFCorse, he was accompanied to Israel with Ferrari teammates including former Formula 1 driver Giancarlo Fisichella, Marco Cioci and his good friend, former GP2 Series driver Nathanaël Berthon. Besides possessing several limited edition Ferraris, Cartu owns other luxury cars including BMWs, a Rolls Royce Phantom, and a custom BAC Mono race car. In June 2014, he was honored by Ferrari and presented with the 'Mr. Cavalcade' award in 2015, was the fastest driver through the slalom exercise. In January 2016, Cartu was interviewed by Forbes Magazine in a QA session explaining how sponsorship of racing functions work and the way in which branding and marketing takes place in the sport."

He was born in Cambridge and died at Kaiteriteri, Tasman Region, New Zealand. Marshall was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham and at Trinity College, Cambridge. His first first-class cricket match as a tail-end right-handed batsman for Cambridge Town Club in 1857 also featured his elder brother, Joseph, who played for Cambridge University between 1855 and 1857, winning three Blues for cricket. John Marshall then won a Blue himself as a middle-order batsman for Cambridge University in 1859, appearing in the University Match against Oxford and top-scoring with an unbeaten 38 in the first innings: he scored just 7 in the second innings in a low-scoring game that Cambridge won by 28 runs. Marshall did not play in first-class cricket for Cambridge University after 1859; most of the rest of his cricket was for Cambridgeshire, then considered one of the major cricketing county sides, and his highest score was an unbeaten 47 in the home match against Surrey in 1861. He later played in minor matches for Suffolk. Marshall graduated from Cambridge University in 1860 and, after a short spell as a schoolmaster, he was ordained as a Church of England clergyman. He was curate at Great Barton, Suffolk to 1868, then priest in charge at Horseheath, Cambridgeshire for a year; he was vicar of Sapiston, Suffolk from 1869 to 1871. He retired to New Zealand because of ill-health and died there aged 41."

  "text" : "Joseph William Marshall (5 December 1835 – 10 September 1915) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge Town Club, Cambridge University and Cambridgeshire. He was born in Cambridge and died at Kidbrooke, Blackheath, London. Marshall was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He played cricket for Cambridge University in all three seasons from 1855 to 1857 and appeared in the University Match against Oxford University each year. Details of his cricket are in some places sketchy, and it is not known if he was right- or left-handed; he played as an opening or middle-order batsman and also bowled, though he appears to have been a change bowler rather than a front-line bowler. In the University Match of 1857, he scored 48 in the Cambridge first innings, the highest score of his university cricket career, and he took two Oxford wickets; but Oxford won the match comfortably. Earlier in the same season, his score of 78 for the Cambridge Town Club against the university team was the highest of his first-class career; in this match, his younger brother John made his first-class debut. He did not play any further first-class cricket after leaving Cambridge University, though he continued to appear in minor matches, including some for Staffordshire, through to the 1880s. After leaving university, Marshall was ordained as a clergyman in the Church of England and served as curate at Martley, Worcestershire and in two churches in Birmingham. From 1864 to 1875 he was vicar of Birchfield, then part of Staffordshire. He then moved to St John the Evangelist's Church, Blackheath in south-east London as vicar and remained there until his retirement in 1909; from 1900 he was an honorary canon of Rochester Cathedral and from 1906 a canon also of Southwark Cathedral, retaining both of these posts to his death in 1915. Marshall's daughter, Elsie Marshall, was one of the Christian missionaries killed in 1895 in the Kucheng Massacre in China; he edited her letters for publication."

  "text" : "Julia Benjamin (born February 21, 1957) is a retired American film and television actress of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. She is best remembered for her character role as Susie Baxter, the daughter of Steve and Barbara Baxter and the first cousin of Harold \"Sport\" Baxter on the 1960s sitcom Hazel. Benjamin was also well known for her roles in the movies Mr. and Mrs. Bo Jo Jones and The Jordan Chance. Benjamin's career began at the age of eight on Hazel in 1965. Hazel was a sitcom that first aired in 1961 on NBC. The series centered on the Baxter family. The family included husband George Baxter, (Don DeFore), his wife Dorothy Baxter, (Whitney Blake) and their only child, son Harold \"Sport\" Baxter, (Bobby Buntrock). At the end of the 1964-65 television season, NBC canceled the series. CBS decided to pick it up for a fifth season. CBS cast Ray Fulmer, Lynn Borden, and Benjamin as George Baxter's brother Steve, his wife Barbara and their daughter Susie. The premise of the fifth season was that George and Dorothy had to move to the Middle East as part of a job promotion. So, Hazel and Harold moved in with Steve, Barbara, and Susie. The series was cancelled by CBS airing its last episode on April 11, 1966. It was never picked up again. After Hazel, Benjamin would only get roles in a limited few number of movies and guest starring roles on television. After Hazel went off the air, Benjamin would have only five roles in movies and television. Her television credits include three guest starring roles on the television shows My Three Sons, The Rockford Files and Riptide. Her movie credits include two TV movies; Mr. and Mrs. Bo Jo Jones (1971), and The Jordan Chance (1978). Riptide was Benjamin's last acting appearance. She has not acted in anything since."

  "text" : "John Beard (11 November 1858 – 1924) was a Scottish embryologist, known for his controversial theory of the trophoblastic origin of cancer and his experimental treatments of cancer by means of pancreatic enzymes. Beard attended Owens College, Manchester and the Royal College of Science, London, where he studied under T. H. Huxley. He received further education, specializing in embryology, at the Universities of Würzburg and Freiburg. Upon his return to the U.K. he became a naturalist working for the Scottish Fishery Board at the Marine Laboratory at Dunbar. He left his Fishery Board employment in 1890 to accept an appointment as assistant lecturer in embryology of vertebrates at the University of Edinburgh. Beard was soon afterwards also appointed assistant lecturer in comparative anatomy of vertebrates, and was assistant (then senior) lecturer in embryology and assistant lecturer in comparative anatomy of vertebrates from 1890 to 1920. In 1893 he became Lecturer in Embryology (i.e. senior lecturer at the highest pay scale) in succession to the late George Brook (1857–1893). Beard was also, for about twenty years or more, senior assistant to the professor of natural history, Prof. J. C. Ewart. Beard was the author of more than 100 scientific articles or monographs. A collection of his papers dealing with the enzyme treatment of cancer was published in 1911."

A right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm slow bowler in the round-arm bowling style, he did well in the freshmen's trial cricket match at Cambridge with seven wickets, but was given only one match for the first eleven cricket team, the game against the Gentlemen of England side; he failed to score in the only Cambridge innings and bowled six overs in the second Gentlemen innings, taking a single wicket. Maul graduated from Cambridge University in 1881 and immediately was ordained in the Church of England. He served as curate at Ryhope, County Durham, from 1881 to 1889 when he moved to the parish of Laidley with Gatton in Queensland, Australia, where he was incumbent to 1894. After that, he took no further parish responsibilities, but, returning to England, he was permitted to officiate in church services from 1914 in the diocese of Gloucester and later in London."

Later on, he participated in a military expedition to China (1860–62), on which he collected botanical and malacological specimens on stops in the Canary Islands and South Africa. Afterwards, he was stationed in Corsica (1870) and Perpignan (1872), later returning to Algeria, where he worked as chief pharmacist at the hospital in Oran (1880–86). In 1898 he retired and settled in Toulouse. Most plant taxa with specific epithet of debeauxii commemorate his name, an example being Gymnocarpos debeauxii.

But it was his heroic participation in ad hoc rescue efforts on May 21, 1944 following a devastating explosion of ammunition back at Pearl Harbor that earned him a Navy & Marine Corps Medal for distinguished heroism.It was following the receipt of this medal that Tezanos was sent to a four-month officer training school. Following his commissioning Tezanos spent a year as a junior officer aboard the transport J.T. Dickman.He was demobilized in early 1946, attending college and graduate school. Upon graduation he became a successful international businessman."

  "text" : "James Chisholm (September 30, 1815 – September 15, 1855) was an Episcopal priest in Portsmouth, Virginia who died of yellow fever after working to assist others (of every denomination) stricken by an epidemic. Chisholm was born in Salem, Massachusetts and moved to Virginia to teach. He converted to the Episcopal church and was ordained, then served as the first rector of St. John's Episcopal Church in Portsmouth, founded in 1848 as part of the Oxford Movement although with the permission of Virginia's bishop, William Meade. In February, 1855, Rev. Chisholm's wife died, leaving him to care for two young sons. When yellow fever struck Portsmouth and nearby Norfolk in the summer and one of his sons fell ill, Chisholm sent his boys to live with relatives, but returned to the city. Almost all other leading citizens, ranging from doctors to clergy, left, but Rev. Chisholm remained to assist those stricken by the epidemic, with not only pastoral care, but food, medical care and even digging graves. He worked closely with Rev. Francis Devlin of the city's St. Paul's Catholic Church to assist Irish immigrants who continued to live in \"pestilential abodes\". As the disease abated in the fall, Chisholm had been so weakened by his efforts (and news that one of his sons had died) that he himself succumbed at the Portsmouth Naval Hospital, becoming one of the 3,200 deaths in a city which had about 12,000 residents the previous winter. About 20 people turned out for his funeral, conducted by a Baptist minister. Rev. Chisholm is buried in Portsmouth's Cedar Grove cemetery. His memoirs of that epidemic, edited shortly after his death to emphasize the Christian values which prompted the somewhat delicate and retiring (if not bashful) cleric to exhibit fortitude through that epidemic are available at various sources.Since 2010, the Episcopal Church has remembered Chisholm annually on its liturgical calendar on September 15."

  "text" : "Johann Arnold Kanne (31 May 1773, Detmold – 17 December 1824, Erlangen) was a German philologist and linguist. In his writings, he used the pseudonyms Johannes Author, Walther Bergius and Anton von Preußen. Beginning in 1790, he studied theology and classical philology at the University of Göttingen, where he was a pupil of Christian Gottlob Heyne. Later on, he worked as schoolteacher in Halle an der Saale, Hersbruck and Leutenberg, and served as a soldier in both the Austrian and Prussian armies. In 1809, through mediation from author Jean Paul, he became an instructor of archaeology and history at the newly founded \"Real Institute\" in Nuremberg. In 1818 he was appointed professor of Oriental languages at the University of Erlangen. Kannes developed a method of \"speculative etymology\", in which he tried to find the one primordial mythology that decided all others. His method was an attempt to discover the so-called primordial language on which the primordial mythology was based. He postulated that language arose from \"root words\" for the divine based on the mystical dynamism of natural phenomena. He further postulated that since root words didn't change, all language evolved from them. He believed that he could reveal these root words by way of an etymology that merged the root words of all archaic languages, His derivation of a general theory of mythology from the etymological method, although scientifically unfounded, was an important influence to the young career of Jacob Grimm."

Translated in 13 languages, it's a collection of stories about the life of Joseph Ratzinger, his origins, and his commitment to study and work. It is an original biography because the narrator is Chico, the cat owned by Joseph Ratzinger's neighbours in Pentling, bavaria. The introduction was written by Georg Ganswein, private secretary of Benedict XVI. The book was translated in 13 languages, from English to polish, including Monegasque. In a second book, Max & Benedict, it is a lonely sparrow that lives on the vatican walls that narrates the everyday life of the successor of Saint Peter. This book was also translated in other languages, like English and Norwegian."

Nevertheless, The Border Lord became a Literary Guild selection, and The Queen's Grace was serialized in the Ladies' Home Journal. She has been cited as a source of inspiration by romance novelists Karen Harper, Shirlee Busbee, Susanna Kearsley, and Bertrice Small.

We are, says a correspondent, quite equal to the people in the days of old; for we have our magicians, necromancers, and such like, to bring the hidden things to light. There is an old man named Murrells, a sort of quack doctor and herbalist living at Hadleigh, who has been practicing the magician for years, and in some cases successfully; and many persons are in the habit of going to him for advice and assistance[...] Of course the little old man in knee breeches and gaiters, and an old coat, is looked upon in the neighbourhood as more potent than a whole troop of policemen.\"", "\"A young woman found an old gypsy hiding in a barn and ordered her out. She was a witch, and she cursed the girl who presently began to scream like a cat and bark like a dog. Murrell was called in. He placed in the fire a bottle containing hair and nail-clippings from the victim. He told everyone to keep absolutely silent while they awaited the arrival of the witch. Presently there came a hammering on the door, and a woman's voice begged him to stop 'the test', as the fire was causing her agony. The bottle burst. On the following morning, an old woman was found burned to death outside the Woodcutters' Arms, three miles away. It was the gypsy. The girl recovered.\"" ],

  "text" : "James Murrell (c. 1785 – 16 December 1860), also known as Cunning Murrell, was an English cunning man, or professional folk magician, who spent most of his life in the town of Hadleigh in the eastern English county of Essex. In this capacity, he reportedly employed magical means to aid in healing both humans and animals, exorcising malevolent spirits, countering witches, and restoring lost or stolen property to its owner. Born in Rochford, Essex, Murrell grew up in the area before moving to Southwark in London, where he was married in 1812. He had seventeen children with his wife, and the family later moved back to Essex, settling in Hadleigh, where Murrell gained work as a shoemaker. At some point he also began working as a cunning man, gaining fame for his work in this field on both sides of the Thames Estuary. Describing himself as \"the Devil's Master\", he cultivated an air of mystery about himself, also experimenting with the creation of iron witch bottles. On a number of occasions his magical activities gained the attention of the local press. Although many residents valued his services and viewed him as a good and benevolent individual, his activities proved controversial and divisive. Many educated figures criticised what they saw as his role in encouraging superstition among the local population; his death certificate recorded his profession as that of a \"quack doctor\". Murrell's fame greatly increased after his death when he was made the subject, albeit in a highly fictionalised form, of a 1900 novel by Arthur Morrison. Morrison also produced a more objective study of the cunning man, published in The Strand magazine. During the 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple conducted further research on Murrell, finding much local folklore still surrounding him in the Hadleigh area, including the allegation that he had the ability to fly and to instantaneously transport himself vast distances. Murrell has continued to attract the attention of historians and folklorists studying English folk magic, and is referenced in works by scholars like Ronald Hutton, Owen Davies, and Ralph Merrifield."

  "text" : "Julia Gasper is a British independent academic specialising in historical literature and a right-wing political activist affiliated with the English Democrats. She formerly belonged to the UK Independence Party (UKIP). A vociferous critic of LGBT rights, she has generated controversy with comments widely deemed homophobic and transphobic. In 1987, Gasper obtained a D.Phil in English Literature from the University of Oxford after studying at Somerville College. She converted her D.Phil thesis – a study of the role of Protestantism in the work of Thomas Dekker – into her first book; published in 1990, it received a mixed critical reception. She has since published two further books on eighteenth-century European history, on Theodore of Corsica and the Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens respectively. Involved in local politics within the Oxford area, she serves as a parish councillor for Risinghurst and Sandhills. In 2012 Gasper was selected as UKIP's Parliamentary candidate for Oxford East. She was scrutinised for her anti-LGBT blog posts by LGBT-themed news service Pink News, whose readers she then asserted were mentally ill. When The Sunday Mirror exposed further anti-LGBT comments that she had made on a UKIP members forum, she was denounced by party leader Nigel Farage and stepped down from her position. Changing her allegiance to the English Democrats, she unsuccessfully stood for them in the 2014 European Parliament election and for Oxford City Council in a local by-election."

We also beseech that no court should be held in any vill apart from the leet of the Lord King annually and for ever. And also we beseech that if any thief, traitor or malefactor against the peace be captured in any vill, that you will give us a law by which he will be chastised. Arrested and questioned by the commissioners, Preston admitted to writing the petition and bringing it himself to their court. He was then executed. What Preston hoped to accomplish by his act remains a question. After the death of Wat Tyler on June 15 the rising's momentum collapsed, the king and gentry were suppressing any resistance and prosecuting associated crimes. The news of Preston's death provoked further disturbance and a threat on the life of the Abbot of St Osyth."

  "text" : "Jorge Manuel Roxo Martins de Lima (born January 29, 1981 in Cascais) is a Portugal sailor, who specialized in men's skiff (49er) class. He represented Portugal, along with his partner Francisco Andrade, at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and has also been training for Cascais Naval Club (Portuguese: Clube Naval de Cascais) throughout most of his sporting career under his personal coach Pedro Pinto. As of September 2014, Lima is ranked twenty-fourth in the world for the men's skiff class by the International Sailing Federation, following his successes at the European Championships, and 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships in Santander, Spain. Lima qualified as a skipper for the Portuguese squad in the 49er class at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing by placing twelfth and receiving a berth from the World Championships in Melbourne, Australia. Teaming with crew member Francisco Andrade in the opening series, the Portuguese duo recorded a net score of 100 points to establish an eleventh-place finish in a fleet of nineteen boats, narrowly missing a spot for the medal race by France's Emmanuel Dyen and Yann Rocherieux by a single grade. At the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships in Santander, Spain, Lima and his new partner José Costa set their best career record with a fifth-place finish in the men's 49er class to secure a spot on the Portuguese sailing team for the 2016 Summer Olympics."

He was one of the signatories of the second Treaty of Guérande in 1381 as a representative for the Duke of Brittany John IV. The duke had restored his rights and agreed to make a small tribute to the king Charles VI. Furthermore, Brittany would stay neutral in continuing military conflicts between France and England. In 1382 he fought at the Battle of Roosebeke. In 1397 De Rieux was appointed as Marshal of France. In 1405 he was sent to Wales to help the Welsh with the Glyndŵr Rising. He had left Brest in July with more than 3,000 knights and men-at-arms. Unfortunately, the army had not been provided with sufficient fresh water and many warhorses had died. He did though bring modern siege equipment. Joined by Owain Glyndŵr's forces the French marched inland and took the town of Haverfordwest but failed to take the castle. He then marched to England, but the result of this expedition was not successful. His age and the injuries that he had received over the years would prevent him from performing his duties. He was, at his request, relieved from his duties at 12 August 1417. He died the same year in his castle at Rochefort, where he was buried."

  "text" : "John Cordeaux FRGS (27 February 1831, Foston, Leicestershire – 1 August 1899, Great Coates House) was an English amateur naturalist and ornithologist, known for his work with the British Association on bird migration. Cordeaux began his study of bird migration on the coasts of the counties of Lincolnshire (where he lived) and Yorkshire. In 1872 he published a summary of the results of years of observations in his book Birds of the Humber District. In the autumn of 1874 he went to the island of Heligoland to learn about the ornithological knowledge accumulated by Heinrich Gätke; soon after the visit Cordeaux wrote a paper for The Ibis describing Gätke’s collection. In 1879 Cordeaux collaborated with J. A. Harvie-Brown in persuading keepers of lighthouses and lightvessels on the coasts of England and Scotland to accumulate information on bird migration. At the summer 1880 meeting at Swansea, the British Association formed a committee headed by Alfred Newton with Cordeaux as secretary; the purpose of the committee was to systematically continue the work which Cordeaux and Harvie-Brown had shown to be practicable. At the summer 1896 meeting of the British Association at Liverpool, W. Eagle Clarke presented a Digest of the Observations for the committee's findings. For thirty-five years, Cordeaux made ornithological contributions to The Ibis, The Zoologist and several other journals. In 1894 he was the president of the Lincolnshire Naturalists' Union."

After the name of the city was changed to Kitchener in 1916, Eden became a member of the executive of a group called the Citizens' League which was formed in opposition to the so-called British League which had lobbied for the name change. Candidates supported by the Citizens' League won out in the city elections held in 1917. The British League was not gracious in defeat and there were incidents of vandalism after the election results were announced.

John qualified as a barrister and moved to Ireland where he rose to the top of the legal profession : he became Prime Serjeant-at-law under King Charles II. Since he was a determined opponent of King James II, he was removed from office by James's government, and was later proscribed by the Irish Parliament. After the Glorious Revolution he was restored to office as Serjeant, but his notable independence of mind, and his detestation of all former Jacobites, Protestant as well as Roman Catholic, which extended even to those who had pledged their loyalty to the new King William III, soon made him almost as obnoxious to the new regime as he had been to the old. He was dismissed from office shortly before his death in 1692."

  "text" : "Alderman John Bowen JP (1844-1926) was an English businessman and was High Sheriff of Worcestershire. Bowen was born on 16 December 1844. His father was a blacksmith from Rochford, Worcestershire. In 1875 he founded the firm of builders, John Bowen and Sons, in Birmingham, which was subsequently responsible for several notable buildings, not least Victoria Law Courts, and several others, on Corporation Street in that city. He served as a magistrate in Worcestershire, was elected as an alderman for the county in 1892, and was High Sheriff of Worcestershire in 1916-1917. Bowen died on 16 April 1926 and is buried, with his second wife, at Brandwood End Cemetery. In 2014, the Birmingham Civic Society unveiled a blue plaque in his honour, with the intention of affixing it to another of his buildings, a school now known as The Ark Academy in Tindal Street, in the city's Balsall Heath. The unveiling was attended by three High Sheriffs, for the West Midlands (Tim Watts), Powys (Philip Bowen), and Worcestershire (Michael Hogan), as well as Deputy Lord Lieutenant David Bradnock. Bowen once lived on Tindal Street, and later lived in Moseley, in a house called Rochford (52°27′11″N 1°53′35″W﻿ / ﻿52.45300°N 1.89298°W; since demolished), on Strensham Hill. A biography, Alderman John Bowen J.P. 'Honest John' by Bowen's great-grandson, Anthony Collins, was published in 2014."

He wrote 19 chansons, 14 motets, and 2 masses which have survived. Courtois’ work exhibits the varied imitative procedures and shifting textural treatment which typify the Franco-Netherlandish motet style. The chansons, for 4 voices, are in the \"Parisian\" style of the day; the works for 5 or 6 voices are in the more contrapuntal \"Netherlandish\" style."

  "text" : "Jean Abraham Grill (21 July 1736 – 12 March 1792), sometimes called Johan Abraham Grill, was a Swedish merchant, supercargo, director of the Swedish East India Company (SOIC) and ironmaster at Godegård with several factories. Grill journeyed to China twice as the representative for the SOIC. He lived in Canton (now known as Guangzhou) as well as Macao for a total of almost ten years, doing trade for the company during the arrival of three Swedish ships. In China he lived the life of an adventurer; survived a shipwreck, traded with other East Asian countries together with his partner Michael Grubb and smuggled opium from India to China. He returned to Sweden in 1768, a wealthy man and lived the rest of his life in Swedish high society, writing minor essays about his travels as member of the Royal Swedish Academies of Sciences and Music. He married Lovisa Ulrika Lüning and bought the Godegård Manor and several ironworks, which he renovated and improved. When Grill died in 1792, his wife took over his business and ran the ironworks and factories. His most notable legacy is the notes, correspondence, accounts, cargo lists and books he kept during his life. They are preserved in the Godegård Archive and in the Gothenburg University Library."

  "text" : "James Holmes (1777 – 24 February 1860) was a painter in oil and water-colour of genre scenes and miniatures. James Holmes was at an early age apprenticed to the well-known engraver Robert Mitchell Meadows and in 1800 engraved in stipple a portrait of Rickman after Hazlitt. Holmes was also talented in music, specifically as a flute player; Novello recommended that he pursue a career in music. He began attending the Royal Academy schools in 1796 and first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1798. From 1798 to 1849 Holmes exhibited 21 paintings at the Royal Academy, including two miniatures (Miss Emma E. Kendrick and Portraits of the infant children of J. Harlop, Esq.) in 1819 and one miniature in 1848. He became a water-colourist and in 1813 became a member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours, exhibiting there two of his paintings, Hot Porridge and The Married Man. He continued exhibiting there until 1820. In 1822 he resigned from the Society of Painters in Water Colours, and became in 1824 a founding member of the Society of British Artists, and a frequent exhibitor, chiefly in miniatures, until 1850; he was the president of the Society in 1829. He had a successful practice as a portrait painter in miniature. Two of his miniature portraits of Lord Byron were engraved. Holmes’s portraiture of George IV lead to a personal friendship in which they played music together. Published engravings were done for some of Holmes’s paintings, including The Amulet and The Literary Souvenir. He retired to Shropshire."

  "text" : "John Reginald Richardson (1912 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada – 25 November 1997 in Fremont, California) was a Canadian-American physicist and one of the dominant figures in cyclotron development. His many achievements include participation in the first demonstration of phase stability, the development of the first synchrocyclotron and the first sector-focused cyclotron. Richardson grew up in Vancouver until his family immigrated to the USA in 1922. He studied physics at UCLA and was a doctoral student in nuclear physics of Ernest Orlando Lawrence at the University of California, Berkeley, receiving his PhD in 1937. After a year at the University of Michigan, he became Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois. From 1942 he worked on electromagnetic isotope separation for the Manhattan Project in Berkeley and Oak Ridge (calutron). In 1946, after the discovery of the phase stability and the synchrotron principle by Weksler and Edwin McMillan, he collaborated with a group of physicists consisting of Ed Lofgren, Ken MacKenzie, Bernard Peters, Fred Schmidt and Byron Wright in converting the fixed-frequency 37-inch cyclotron at Berkeley to the first synchrocyclotron. This success not only provided the first demonstration of the phase-stability principle but also confirmed the feasibility of converting the large Berkeley 184 inch cyclotron from a classical cyclotron to a synchrocyclotron. An even bigger sector cyclotron with energies up to 520 MeV was built by Richardsons line at TRIUMF in Vancouver. From 1971 to 1976, Richardson was the director of the laboratory, where he oversaw the construction of the cyclotron. In 1991 he received the Robert R. Wilson Prize."

  "text" : "James Benjamin Maddison (born 9 July 1988), known by his pen name Jamie Bunchuk, is an English explorer, equestrian Long Rider (assoc.) and an editor of  Sidetracked Magazine. He is best known for his exploration of the Central Asia region. Bunchuk's first expedition was to the Djangart Valley of the Tian Shan mountains in eastern Kyrgyzstan. Since then, he has mounted numerous expeditions including: spending one month living and working with Kirghiz hunters in South East Tajikistan (as well as small archaeological discoveries from the X-XI C. Sak city of Bazar Dara), a 100 mile, multi-day, camel supported run across the Red Sands Desert in Uzbekistan, chronicling the lives of Kazakh eagle hunters in Western Mongolia and Winter packrafting down the Khovd River, Mongolia (temperatures down to -20 °C) in retrofitted and homemade packrafts. In 2013, Bunchuk – alongside friend and colleague Matthew Traver – completed a 750 mile, 63-day-long, horse ride from Ust-Kamenogorsk to Almaty, in honour of the centenary of a historical journey through the region by the Anglo-Irish explorer Sir Charles Howard-Bury. For their efforts, the pair were presented with an award for the 'Best individual contribution for furthering relations between the UK and Kazakhstan' by the British-Kazakh Society at the House of Commons. For the expedition, he was also the recipient of a Sir Peter Holmes Memorial Award from the Royal Society for Asian Affairs. This award is designed to encourage independent and purposeful travel in Asia. In the Autumn of 2014, Bunchuk led the first expedition ever to cross the Betpak-Dala or the ‘Steppe of Misfortune’ from its easternmost extremity on the shores of Lake Balkash to its western edge on the Sarysu River. He also ran 190 miles, nearly eight marathons, back to back over the course of eight days within the region. The expedition was aided by two locals, a supporting 4WD, and with funding from the French underwear company HOM. Bunchuk is an established journalist, having penned a number of investigative articles including on deforestation within Armenia (published in Geographical Magazine) and reporting on the further environmental damage of Lake Sevan’s changing water levels (published in Hidden Europe Magazine). He is now an editor of Sidetracked Magazine and presenter for Sidetracked TV."

As an early exponent of the ophicleide, Guivier became one of Jullien's core of elite musicians along with other soloists such as Herman Koenig. Ill health forced him to reduce his musical engagements during the 1850s and he supplemented his income by dealing and consulting on the design of brass instruments.

  "text" : "John Costello (31 March 1838 – 25 February 1923) was a pioneer and pastoralist in outback Queensland. Born in Yass, New South Wales, Costello was the fifth child of Michael and Mary Costello. His father was a store-keeper and grazier who had come to Australia with his wife from Ireland in 1837. All four of his siblings died en route to Australia, the family later had a daughter named Mary. The family had settled in Yass in 1851 after selling their store and acquired 1,000 acres (405 ha) in the area. Costello quickly became a renowned stockman. In 1863 his younger sister, Mary, married Patrick Durack. Costello and Durack both shared a hunger for land and were fascinated by stories of explorers travelling through outback Queensland. In 1863 the pair met William Landsborough and decided to lead a party to acquire land in south west Queensland. Drought conditions almost killed the men, but Costello was encouraged by his bride, Mary Scanlan, whom he married in 1865. The Costellos along with Durack formed a depot at Warroo Springs in outback New South Wales then later moved north to Mobel Creek. The Costellos had a son that died of fever, and then they had a daughter. In 1867 Costello overlanded 200 horses from Mobel Creek through uncharted territory to Kapunda, South Australia. Earning £3000 on the sale, Costello returned and acquired the lease to Mobel Springs, a holding of 40,000 acres (16,187 ha). Costello and Durack moved north again and established both Kyabra and Thylungra Station in 1868 with 100 cattle.In 1869 both drought and depression were taking their toll on the state but Costello continued to acquire lands around the Channel Country and lightly stock them. The 1870s saw better seasons in the area and buyers moved in to acquire land controlled by Costello and Durack. Costello himself held leases over 13,000 square miles (33,670 km2) of lands through the Channel Country of Queensland. Costello established many stations through the Channel Country including Kyabra, Davenport Downs, Morney Plains, Currawilla and Connemara Stations. In 1877 Costello sold Kyabra and bought a racing stud, Cawarral, near Rockhampton and another property near Galdstone. But in 1879 he went back to the bush and acquired Lake Nash Station, which straddles the Northern Territory and Queensland border. While drought was taking its toll on his coastal properties Costello acquired another 2,000 square miles (5,180 km2) in the Northern Territory."

While there, he sought to rent a house in Lexington, but was rebuffed by the owner Mark Moore, Jr. His case led to a civil rights movement protest on the Lexington Battle Green. Parker later served in Douala and Yaoundé, Cameroon where he was Consul General and later Deputy Chief of Mission. His last overseas assignment was in La Paz, Bolivia where he was again Deputy Chief of Mission and Chargé d'affaires. He also served as Desk Officer for Central Africa."

  "text" : "Marie-Angele \"Jovette\" Alice Bernier (November 27, 1900 – December 4, 1981) was a journalist and writer in Quebec. Because of extensive exposure in the print media and on radio, she was often referred to simply as Jovette. The daughter of Joseph-Elzéar Bernier and Élise Morest, she was born in Saint-Fabien-de-Rimouski. She attended the Normal School in Rimouski and went on to teach in the Gaspé region and later Quebec City. Bernier began her career in journalist in 1923 and, over the next 50 years, appeared in print, on radio and on television. She wrote for L'Événement in Quebec city, La Tribune in Sherbrooke and L'Illustration in Montreal. In 1932, she was given a daily show Bonjour madame on radio station CKAC. From 1939 to 1958, Bernier was the host of the radio show Quelles nouvelles , which included sketch comedy. From 1963 to 1965, she wrote scripts for the Quebec soap opera Rue de l’Anse. She published five collections of poems: \n*  Roulades (1924) \n*  Comme l'oiseau (1926) \n*  Tout n'est pas dit (1929), which won the Lieutenant-Governor's medal \n*  les Masques déchirés (1932) \n*  Mon deuil en rouge (1945) and two novels: \n*  La chair décevante (1931) \n*  Non Monsieur (1969), which received the Prix du Cercle du livre de France Bernier died in Longueuil at the age of 81. Rue Jovette-Bernier in Sherbrooke and Rue Jovette-Bernier in Quebec City were named in her honour. An annual literary prize, the Prix Jovette-Bernier (later known as the Prix Jovette-Bernier—Ville de Rimouski), was created in her honour."

  "text" : "Jean Bosler (24 March 1878, Angers – 25 September 1973, Marseille) was a French astronomer and author of several books. Recruited by Deslandres as an astronomer at l’observatoire de Paris, Bosler discovered in 1908 in the spectrum of Comet Morehouse the spectral lines of ionized nitrogen, which was the first evidence of that element in comets. Much of his research was on the physical properties and orbits of comets. He made a report on progress in astrophysics in the United States for the 1910 annual report of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1912, he showed in his doctoral dissertation (supervised by Henri Poincaré) that the Sun’s magnetic field, by means of the intermediary of the solar wind, explains many aspects of cometary tails, the aurora borealis and aurora australis, solar storms and telluric currents. During a solar eciipse in 1914, Bosler observed in the corona a spectral band “nouvelle, intense et unique” which he suggested was spectral evidence for coronium; however, in the 1930s subsequent research showed that the cause was a highly ionized form of iron. In 1916, he published an analysis of the circular form of lunar craters as caused by the impact of meteors. In 1923 Bosler was named director of Marseille Observatory, a post he occupied until his retirement in 1948. Simultaneously with his directorship, he taught at the University of Marseille from 1923 to 1948. Bosler made important contributions to the theory of the evolution of stars and published the first textbook in French that dealt with the then recent discoveries of Hubble and the work on optical phenomena of such physicists as Michelson, Fabry and Perot. Bosler won the Prix Jules Janssen in 1911 from the Société astronomique de France, the French astronomical society, and the Prix Lalande from l'Académie des sciences in 1913."

  "text" : "John Russell Napier (5 January 1859 – 12 March 1939) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University in 1881 and for Lancashire in 1888. He was born at Preston, Lancashire and died at Bexhill, East Sussex. Napier was educated at Marlborough College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was captain of the cricket eleven at Marlborough and played in trial matches at Cambridge in both 1879 and 1880, but did not appear in any first-class games in those years; as a cricketer, he was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler in the round-arm style. Napier finally appeared in first-class cricket in 1881 and did well in his first match for Cambridge University, taking five wickets in a high-scoring match against the Gentlemen of England and scoring 14 in his only innings. In his second match, the game against Lancashire at the Aigburth cricket ground in Liverpool he took only one wicket before being injured: a contemporary report stated that \"Mr. Napier strained himself through his tremendously swift bowling and had to leave the field\". Napier graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1882 and was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. He was curate at Leigh in Lancashire from 1883 to 1886 and then for four years at St Paul's Church, Preston, Lancashire. While working in Lancashire, he played two matches for the county cricket team in 1888. In the first, against the touring Australians, Napier scored 7 and 37 – the second innings score was the highest by a Lancashire player in the match – and took seven wickets in the game as Lancashire won by just 23 runs. His second match for Lancashire was the Roses Match against Yorkshire at Sheffield; with no play possible on the first two days of a three-day game, Napier was put on to bowl late in the Yorkshire innings and took four wickets in 14 balls without conceding a run to finish the innings. He did not play first-class cricket again. Napier's church career took him away from Lancashire. He was vicar of Walsden, West Yorkshire from 1890 to 1906, then rector of North Fambridge in Essex to 1911 and finally vicar of Old Windsor, Berkshire up to his retirement in 1928. He retired to Bexhill in Sussex where he died."

Truby argues that most teachers of screenwriting emphasize inner transformation of the characters but not the moral effect their actions have on others. He is critical of Syd Field's three-act “Paradigm” and has instead crafted his own 22-step outline. Truby's first book The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller was published in October, 2007 by Faber and Faber."

  "text" : "Joachim Hamann (18 May 1913 in Kiel – 13 July 1945) was an officer of the Einsatzkommando 3, a killing unit of Einsatzgruppe A, responsible for thousands of Jewish deaths in Lithuania. Hamann organized and commanded Rollkommando Hamann, a small mobile killing unit composed of 8–10 Germans and several dozens of local Lithuanian collaborators. Hamann was of Baltic German parentage. Trained as a chemist, he had difficulties finding a job due to the Great Depression. He joined SA in August 1931, NSDAP in December 1932, and SS in July 1938. He served in the Wehrmacht during the invasion of Poland and Battle of France as a paratrooper (Fallschirmjäger). He returned to Berlin where he joined the SS and completed training courses. In March 1941, he was promoted to SS-Obersturmführer (First Lieutenant). After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Hamann organized and commanded Rollkommando Hamann which killed at least 39,000 Jews in various locations across Lithuania and 9,102 people, almost all of whom were Jews, from the Daugavpils Ghetto. Hamann's superior, Karl Jäger, documented these killings in the Jäger Report. Nevertheless Martin C. Dean sets the death toll of Rollkommando Hamann to 60.000 murdered people in Lithuania alone. Hamann left Lithuania in October 1941 and continued his SS career. In 1942, SS-Hauptsturmführer Hamann participated in the Operation Zeppelin, a scheme to recruit Soviet POWs for espionage behind Russian lines. From 1943 he worked at Amt IV of RSHA (Gestapo). He was involved in apprehending and executing suspected members of the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. He was appointed aide to Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Director of the Reich Main Security Office. In January 1945, Hamann was promoted to SS-Sturmbannführer. After the war, Hamann committed suicide."

Although having several arrests for federal narcotics violations since the 1930s, Deluca ran a major drug ring operation for mobster Joseph DiGiovanni until his arrest and eventually conviction in 1942, along with seven other members (his girlfriend would be convicted of jury tampering the following year). In 1952, DeLuca and his brother were named two of the \"Five Iron Men\" of Kansas City by the US Senate Kefauver Committee."

Love started broadcasting on Justin.tv in between odd jobs under the name Man vs Game  from a studio in the basement of his home in Montana. He uses a green screen to superimpose himself over the footage of the game he is playing. Early 2013, when the show began to suffice as Loves sole source of income, he quit his other job and became a full-time professional broadcaster. In 2013 he expected it to be possible to receive an income of over $100,000 for 2014 from advertisement and subscription revenue. The Daily Dot's Kevin Moris describes the appeal of the show in Love's ability to interact with his viewers, and the personal atmosphere he creates."

  "text" : "John Laschinger is a veteran political organizer in Canada. He is best known for organizing election campaigns and party leadership bids for a variety of candidates. He has written a book on his views and ideas on campaigns, entitled: \"Leaders & lesser mortals: Backroom politics in Canada\". In 1983, Laschinger was campaign manager for the Hon. John Crosbie, a candidate for leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In 1984, he was campaign manager for the Hon. Larry Grossman in his bid for leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, an effort he repeated for Mr. Grossman in the party's 1985 leadership campaign. Laschinger was a key organizer for Belinda Stronach's bid to lead the Conservative Party of Canada in 2004, and John Tory's bid to lead the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario also in 2004. He then worked as campaign manager for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in the 2007 general election. Laschinger also served other conservative politicians in Canada, including New Brunswick and Manitoba. After 2000, Laschinger worked as a campaign consultant for political leaders in several former Soviet republics. Known for working with Conservatives, Laschinger was an important figure in the NDP-aligned David Miller's bid to become Mayor of Toronto in 2003 and was his campaign manager in 2006. For the 2010 Toronto mayoralty election, he served as campaign manager for Adam Giambrone, another Toronto politician with ties to the NDP, prior to Giambrone abandoning the race. He then supported City Councillor Joe Pantalone, also aligned with the NDP, in his unsuccessful run to become Toronto's mayor. In 2014, Laschinger emerged as campaign director for Olivia Chow's mayoralty campaign. A former Toronto education trustee and city councillor, then NDP MP for Trinity-Spadina when husband Jack Layton was party leader (and briefly Leader of the Opposition in 2011 until his death from cancer), Chow resigned to return to Toronto politics. Under Laschinger, her campaign started as the front-runner but faltered when John Tory -- Laschinger's client a decade before -- entered the race."

She played then as \"J. Solodar\" and for many years ACBL listed her then-husband John Solodar. She became a World Bridge Federation woman grand master in 1987, along with her regular partner Kathie Wei, as one of two US teams won the biennial Venice Cup. At 37 years old she was the youngest woman WGM to that date. (Radin–Wei had played on the 1981 and 1985 Venice Cup runners-up and the U.S. gold medal winners in the 1984, quadrennial World Team Olympiad, women flight.) She returned to the Venice Cup field in 2011 and 2013 on two U.S. teams that finished fifth, and played on the U.S. national teams in the 2008 and 2012 World Mind Sports Games (which inherited the Olympiad series)."

She has won five world titles, four of them when partnering Gail Moss. Mitchell was inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 2003. At the time she was a busy professional teacher as well as player. In 1983, she took part in a televised match between teams representing the US and Britain, arranged by the BBC. The match was featured in a book that described her thus:Jackie [sic] Mitchell... is as utterly self disciplined at the table as she is away from it... She passes much of her time at the table doing embroidery as though determined to remain detached, but those who trifle with her do so at their peril. If her bidding sometimes appears orthodox, or a little too conservative, her card play and defence are of the very highest quality."

  "text" : "Jaime Marquet (born Jacques Marquet, in París, 1710–1782) was a French architect who worked extensively in Bourbon Spain, and whose most important work includes the central plaza of Madrid known as Puerta del Sol and the adjacent monumental building, the Real Casa de Correos or Royal Mail Headquarters, now the offices of the President of the Community of Madrid. In the 1750s he was commissioned by Fernando de Silva, 12th Duke of Alba, who was then ambassador of Spain in Paris, to build a new palace in the family seat at Piedrahíta which occurred between 1755 and 1766. The Duke of Alba introduced him to the court of Ferdinand VI after which he was commissioned to refurbish the cobblestones of the city of Madrid. In 1755 he entered the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. Between 1756 and 1760, while starting his career in the Spanish capital, King Ferdinand VI commissioned the architect Ventura Rodriguez to lead the demolition of the city blocks 205 and 206 that bordered the Puerta del Sol, and to construct a headquarters building for the Spanish postal service Correos. In 1759, Fernando VI died, but the predilection for the French taste of the Bourbon court continued to flourish under his successor, King Carlos III, who had disagreements about style with Ventura Rodríguez. These two decisive events led to the appointment of Jaime Marquet, who took over responsibility for the design of the Puerta del Sol project in 1760 and undertook construction of the site which occurred between 1766 and 1768. As well as the Palacio Alba in Piedrahita, Puerta de Sol and the Real Casa de Correos in Madrid Jaime Marquet was also responsible for: \n*  Iglesia de San Antonio (Royal church, Aranjuez, c. 1752)  \n*  Cocheras de la Reina Madre, Aranjuez, Madrid (1758) \n*  Los Cuarteles de las Reales Guardias Españolas y Walonas, Aranjuez (1770–72) \n*  Teatro Real Coliseo de Carlos III de Aranjuez, (1767) (the first enclosed theatre built in Spain)  \n*  Teatro Real Coliseo de Carlos III, San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Madrid (1771–72)  \n* Iglesia de San Antonio (Royal church at Aranjuez, c.1752).jpg Español: Iglesia de San Antón (Aranjuez) \n* Facade of the Palace of the Dukes of Alba, in Piedrahíta, built between 1755 and 1766. \n* Real Casa de Correos in Madrid built between about 1760 and 1768 \n* Cocheras de la Reina Madre Isabel de Farnesio (The Coach House of the Queen Mother of Carlos III) \n* Cuartel de Guardias Españolas in Aranjuez (Barracks of the Royal Guards, now in ruins) \n* Main gate of the barracks of Spanish Guards, now relocated to a nearby public park in Aranjuez \n* Real Coliseo de Carlos III (Theater at San Lorenzo de El Escorial."

Despite never winning a national title at the French Athletics Championships, he was the gold medallist at the 1966 European Athletics Championships in Budapest. He defeated compatriot Robert Sainte-Rose – the leading French athlete of the era – by count-back, as both cleared 2.12 m (6 ft 11 1⁄4 in). This made Madubost the first Frenchmen to win a field event at the championship, and he remains the sole French male athlete to win the European title in men's high jump (Anne-Marie Colchen won the women's event 20 years earlier). For his achievement he was given the 1966 medal of the Académie des sports (one of two from athletics, alongside sprinter Roger Bambuck). The 1966 season proved to be a peak of his career, as he also twice improved the French national record with clearances of 2.14 m (7 ft 0 1⁄4 in) and 2.15 m (7 ft 0 1⁄2 in). He represented France at the 1968 European Athletics Indoor Championships, but did not match his previous success and ended the competition in 18th place. A policeman by occupation, after his retirement from athletics he represented France internationally in sport shooting."

After receiving his architecture degree from the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal where he met his wife Gisèle (Bissonnette) — who was studying painting in the master class of Alfred Pellan, he moved to Paris in 1950 where he was hired by Walter Gropius as construction site manager of the Palais de l’UNESCO. There, he worked and collaborated alongside the likes of Marcel Breuer, Pier Luigi Nervi, Le Corbusier, Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder and Joan Miró to name a few. After seven years working in Paris and London, they returned to Montréal, where he worked at the Montréal firm of Bland, Rother and Trudeau. In the early 60's, he teamed up with long-time friend Julien Hébert and founded the firm of Hébert & Lalonde, a firm that combined architecture, graphic, environmental and industrial design. He had many successful collaborations with different artists and sculptors over the years, namely lifetime time friend Charles Daudelin, and won prestigious competitions with him, such as the Maison de Trois-Rivières, Maison de demain, Demeure de l’Avenir ou Maison de béton, École Saint-Damase, etc. During the 70's, Mr. Lalonde developed a unique expertise in designing and building more modern, humane and ergonomic social housing. Many of which won the firm international praise. He also designed the Montréal Métro station Place Sain-Henri, and was part of the consortium which designed and built the original Palais des Congrès de Montréal. He was one of the original members of the Commission Jacques-Viger, whose mandate was the study —and ensuing recommendations— of Old Montréal’s patrimonial assets. He worked on a variety of projects over his career, from private residences to the Lachute Water Treatment plant in Québec, to hospitals, public housing, etc. Jean-Louis Lalonde was also very involved in the promotion of architecture through his life as president of the Ordre des architects du Québec (OAQ), the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) in 1971-1972 and vice-president of the International Union of Architects (UIA). He died on May 30, 2007 from cancer."

Furthermore, Bismarck collaborated with Julian Charrière for the site specific performance “Some pigeons are more equal than others” at the 2012 Venice Biennale for Architecture. This project has also been adapted for performances/instillations in Copenhagen and Berlin. The aforementioned work incorporates a pigeon trapping device designed by Charrière and Bismarck. This equipment is positioned in a public place to capture and subsequently airbrush pigeons as they chart their path within the vicinity."
