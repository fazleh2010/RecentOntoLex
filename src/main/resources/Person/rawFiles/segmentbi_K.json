  "text" : "Kaarene Noelle Fitzgerald, AC (12 December 1944 – 24 May 2003) was an Australian advocate for the study and treatment of Sudden Infant Death.Fitzgerald founded the Sudden Infant Death Research Foundation (known as SIDS & Kids) on 11 July 1977. The organization began the day after her son Glenn died from an unexplainable death, known as a Sudden Infant Death. This was the first NGO of its kind in Australia. In 1999 she was awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia for her services to the community and for \"coordination of world-wide efforts to develop and research educational strategies to reduce sudden infant death in infancy\". She was responsible for the development of a direct referral system involving the Foundation, the Health Department, State Coroner's office, Ambulance Service and hospitals.In 1988, Fitzgerald established Red Nose Day as a fundraising activity and convinced other state based SIDS bodies to join the fundraising activity. It became a signature national fundraising \"day\" in Australia. Internationally, Fitzgerald co-founded SIDS International and was the inaugural executive and then chairman of the group from 1989 - 1992. She then developed a network of research coordination - the Global Strategy Task Force. In 1991 Fitzgerald was approached to help establish the Monash Research Foundation for Reproduction and Development. This group became the Ritchie Centre. Fitzgerald's commitment to research was honored with the Ritchie Centre's annual Kaarene Fitzgerald public forum. Fitzgerald was born in Te Kuiti, New Zealand and died in Melbourne, Australia on May 24, 2003, after a long battle with cancer. She was survived by her four children, Karl, Anita, Lacey & Michael."

In 712, a anti-Abbasid rebellion broke out in Khwarazm, which resulted in the overthrow and death of king Azkajwar II, who had agreed to become a vassal of the Abbasids. Khusrau was shortly put on the throne. However, the Abbasids shortly invaded Khwarazm and ravaged the region, brutally massacring the rebels and burning several important objects of the Khwarazmian culture. Khusrau was shortly killed and was replaced by Azkajwar's son Askajamuk II as the new ruler of the kingdom."

In 2006 he was the youngest male athlete on the Australian athletics team at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games His personal best is 2.24 metres, first achieved in June 2007 in Gold Coast. He later switched to horizontal jumps. In March 2011 he recorded 16.97 metres in Perth and 7.45 metres in Melbourne. Kane Brigg is Australia's greatest all-round jumper as at the end of 2013. His combination of 2.24m (high jump), 16.97m (triple jump) and 7.58m (long jump - Sydney) was 3rd on the world all-time combination jumps list in 2011. His retirement at such a young age (26yo) is truly a great and tragic loss for the sport of athletics in Australia."

He belonged to the Bahram branch of the Marwat tribe. He was originally a poor fox hunter, but Sher Shah spotted his potential and elevated him to the position of a general. According to historical accounts he was born of a slave woman to a household of Lohani Marwats. After victory in the Battle of Sammel, Khawas Khan Marwat took possession of Jodhpur and occupied the territory of Marwar from Ajmer to Mount Abu in 1544. When Hamayun fled from Agra towards Multan, Sher Shah dispatched Khawas Khan and the greater part of his army to pursue him and drive him beyond the borders of Hindustan. The Mughal division which had quit Hamayun and was marching toward Kabul, encountered Khawas Khan and not being strong enough, fled leaving their drums and standards behind. He then rejoined Sher Shah. Sher Shah built Rohtas Fort in Jehlum to keep down Gakkars and to block Emperor Humayun's return to India, and appointed Khawas Khan the administrative head of the fort."

She was raised in Wigan and North Wales, where she became a teacher and later school headmistress. She married in 1930 and moved to Edinburgh shortly afterwards, where she began writing stories for her children, finally settling in Lasswade in Midlothian. During the course of her career, she wrote over 80 novels and non-fiction books for children, many of her novels following the adventures of two families, The Brydons and The Deans. Her work has been praised for the depth and detail of research into the background of her stories. After Fidler died in 1980, her publishers and members of the Edinburgh Children's Book Group established the Kathleen Fidler Award in memory of her work and support for children's literature. The award, which closed in 2002, was awarded to previously unpublished authors for novels for children aged 8 to 12."

  "text" : "Keshav Prasad Maurya is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party and President of UP BJP. He has won the Indian general elections, 2014 from the Phulpur (Lok Sabha constituency). On 11 January 2016, 12 BJP party leaders were expelled from the party for attacking Maurya one week earlier in Ballia, and two other cases were filed against two more BJP leaders. On 8 April 2016, on the first day of Chaitra, he was declared Bharatiya Janata Party chief of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. Like his party's top leader - Prime Minister Narendra Modi - Mr Maurya sold tea in his youth at his father's stall in their village. A member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, he also participated in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Born in 1969, in Sirathu in Kausambhi district, adjoining Allahabad, Mr. Maurya went on to study Hindi Literature at the Hindu Sahitya Sammelan in Allahabad. Hailing from a humble farming family, Mr. Maurya sold tea and newspapers during his childhood, a detail that the BJP hopes to flaunt further. The factors what went in his favour, party sources say, is his humble beginning, deep association with the Sangh and his OBC background. “Gareebi, Sangh aur OBC, the trajectory is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said a BJP leader, quite pleased by the likeness. At 47, Mr. Maurya is relatively young and his full-timer karyakarta background is expected to boost the morale of the BJP-RSS cadre. His RSS upbringing will also provide “energy and help in connecting RSS cadre,” a senior BJP leader said. Since Mr. Maurya is an MP and “won’t have the burden of fighting elections in 2017, he will devote his time entirely to focus on winning the elections,” Mr. Chandramohan said, hailing him as an “aggressive leader.” Though he keeps a low-profile and is not popular outside the Kausambhi-Allahabad-Varanasi belt, Mr. Maurya’s pro-Hindutva image and his promotion could be a sign of things to come. He has been associated with the RSS and the VHP-Bajrang Dal from an early age, holding the posts of Nagar Karyawah and VHP Pranth Sanghathan Mantri, among others. While being active in the gauraksha (cow-protection) movements, he also participated in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In the BJP, Mr. Maurya has been the regional (Kashi) coordinator of the backward class cell and the BJP Kisan Morcha. His political career started out with defeats as he lost two consecutive Assembly elections, 2002 and 2007, but riding on a Modi wave secured the Phulpur Lok Sabha seat in 2014 with a thumping five lakh votes and over 52 per cent votes from the erstwhile Nehru-Gandhi bastion.

  "text" : "Ken Trujillo is a former Democratic candidate for Mayor of Philadelphia. As one of five children in a family often facing poverty, Trujillo attended public schools and became the only one in his family to graduate from college. He then went on to graduate Penn Law School in 1986, where he now teaches as an adjunct professor. Trujillo founded The Food Stamp Clinic in West Philadelphia, worked at Community Legal Aid Services, and spent two decades growing Congreso into one of the largest anti-poverty advocates in the nation. Trujillo also served Philadelphia as City Solicitor and an Assistant U.S. Attorney, winning a historic settlement against gun manufacturers and taking down Philadelphia's largest heroin gang and bank robbery ring. A small business owner, Trujillo founded a successful law practice and purchased historic WHAT 1340 AM, relaunching it as the Spanish-language station El Zol Philly. He was part of President Obama's transition team, and Governor Ed Rendell also appointed Trujillo to oversee Philadelphia's finances as his first appointee to Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority. In July 2016, he joined the Philadelphia-area office of law firm Chamberlain Hrdlicka. Trujillo lives in Philadelphia with his wife, Laura, and daughter, Maya."

  "text" : "Kimberly Wasserman (Kimberly Wasserman Nieto) is an American environmentalist and grassroots leader As director of the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization (LVEJO), she is a recipient of the 2013 Goldman Environmental Prize for leading the successful lobbying campaign for the passage of the Chicago Clean Power Ordinance that resulted in the closing of the Crawford and Fisk coal-fired power plants. Wasserman was raised in Little Village, Illinois. She entered the world of environmental activism in 1998 after her three-month-old son suffered an asthma attack despite having no family history of asthma. After researching the connection between asthma and air pollution, she turned her attention to the coal-fired plants in her neighborhood and became involved with LVEJO. LVEJO is an organization that advocates for environmental justice in Little Village and throughout Chicago. Wasserman started as a community organizer for LVEJO for seven years and has been an executive director since 2005. In 2002, LVEJO first mobilized politically against the emissions coming from the two plants. They organized the collection of signatures to get a referendum on the 2003 City Hall ballot requiring the two plants to either drastically reduce pollution or shut down. While they weren't able to get the immediate support from their aldermen, after a ten-year battle to sway their opinion, they were ultimately successful. On February 28, 2012, it was announced that the Fisk and Crawford plants would be permanently shut down."

  "text" : "The Klapmeier brothers, Alan Lee Klapmeier (born October 6, 1958) and Dale Edward Klapmeier (born July 2, 1961), are American aircraft designers and aviation entrepreneurs who together founded the Cirrus Aircraft Corporation in 1984. Under the leadership of the Klapmeiers, Cirrus was the first aircraft manufacturer to install a whole-plane parachute recovery system as a standard on all its models—designed to lower the airplane (and occupants) safely to the ground in case of an emergency. The device is attributed with saving over 130 lives to date. Cirrus was also the first to use all-composite airframe construction and glass panel cockpits on production aircraft, which many say revolutionized general aviation for light aircraft pilots. TIME magazine credited the Klapmeiers as \"giving lift to the small-plane industry with an easy-to-fly design\", Forbes magazine named their highly popular single-engine SR-series (the Cirrus SR20 and SR22) Best Private Airplane, saying \"the Klapmeier brothers built the first genuinely new plane in the sky in years\", and Flying magazine ranked Alan and Dale at number 17 on their list of 51 Heroes of Aviation. The Klapmeier brothers were inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame on 4 October 2014 in Dayton, Ohio. The brothers started Cirrus in the basement of their parents' rural dairy barn near Baraboo, Wisconsin. Their first design, the VK-30 homebuilt aircraft, had its initial flight on 11 February 1988 and kit deliveries commenced shortly thereafter. Alan left Cirrus in 2009 and became CEO of Kestrel Aircraft in 2010, which in 2015 was merged with Eclipse Aerospace to form ONE Aviation. Dale has remained at Cirrus serving as the company's CEO since 2011."

He was a member of Lok Sabha from Domariyaganj, Uttar Pradesh.Founder of ONGC, Shri KD Malaviya ji is beyond a shadow of any doubt, the unqualified father of the hydrocarbon sector of this country.Undeterred by strong western skepticism about the viability or, even the potential, of the country’s hydrocarbon capabilities which was largely a propaganda driven by the western oil companies, Mr. Malaviya, the original one among the rich lineage of visionaries of the country’s oil & gas industry of which there has been quite a few, was undaunted in his vision and unrelenting in his pursuit of a country that was energy-secure.However, with support from Jawaharlal Nehru, Malaviya launched a crusade for the formation of a national oil company with formation of ONGC in 1956. In fact, most of what Mr. Malaviya achieved, with the unstinted support of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, in those early days of Nehru’s national project of modernizing the nation and making it industrially competent has, over the years, provided and continues to provide a strong foundation to the economic success story that India is today. His commitment to India's progress for gaining self-reliance in energy sector was a shining example of the patriotism for the younger generation and a source of strength to the scientific community. Clear in his thoughts and supremely purposeful in his action, he was an inspiration for the younger generation of that era to come together in the hunt to find oil and secure the country’s future."

Knee injuries curtailed his later career. In 2011, he was hired as the throwing coach for Qatar. But he soon packed his bags and returned to Sweden when he learned he was expected to train Ahmed Mohammed Dheeb who was already on a 2-year doping suspension. His youngest son Jakob Gardenkrans improved Kenths previous world record to 62.58m 2016. His other son Viktor Gardenkrans is also a top Swedish thrower, participating in the 2012 World Junior Championships."

  "text" : "Oluwakemi Adekoya (born 16 January 1993) is a Nigerian-born track and field athlete who competes for Bahrain. She specialises in the 400 metres hurdles and has a personal best of 54.59 seconds – a Bahraini record. She established herself as a hurdler at national level in Nigeria in 2011, placing fifth at the Nigerian championships. In 2012 she improved her best to 57.16 seconds to place second at the Confederation of African Athletics meet in Warri. That year she was runner-up at the Nigerian Olympic trials, but did not have the sufficient qualifying standard. She was selected for the 2012 World Junior Championships in Athletics but did not compete. In 2013 she set a new personal best of 55.30 seconds, finishing runner-up to Muizat Ajoke Odumosu, Nigeria's leading hurdler, and also set a flat 400 metres best of 52.57 seconds. Her hurdles best ranked her within the top thirty fastest athletes in the world that year. Adekoya's first race of 2014 marked a significant change for her career. Making her debut on the Diamond League circuit, she defeated the entire elite 400 m hurdles field in a surprise win. Her time of 54.59 seconds was a world-leading one, and also a Bahraini national record – she had switched nationality to the oil-rich state at the start of the year and displayed a banner saying \"I ♥ Bahrain\" after her victory. This move was unknown to Solomon Ogba, the head of Athletics Federation of Nigeria, who was present at the race in Doha and lodged a complaint with the International Association of Athletics Federations, claiming her move as out-of-process. However, as Adekoya had never formally registered with the national federation, the country could not block the move. Nigerian officials and media noted the case as an example of African nations losing their top home-grown athletes to richer non-African nations (Nigerian sprinters Samuel Francis and Femi Ogunode both moved to Qatar). In her second Diamond League race she was a close second to Kaliese Spencer at the Bislett Games, then took third place at the Golden Spike Ostrava meeting. On Saturday, 13th August, 2016 on Day 9 of the Rio 2016 Olympics games in Brazil, Kemi ran an all time personal best of 50.72 to come out second behind America's Phyllis Francis who ran at 50.58 seconds there by qualifying for the semifinal 3."

  "text" : "Krasimir Simeonov Kochev (Bulgarian: Красимир Симеонов Кочев; born May 4, 1974 in Petrich) is an amateur Bulgarian freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's heavyweight category. Considered as one of Bulgaria's top freestyle wrestlers in his decade, Kochev has claimed two career medals (one silver and one bronze) at the World Championships (2001 and 2003), picked up a bronze at the 2005 European Championships in Varna, and achieved top seventeen finishes in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Kochev trained as a member of the freestyle wrestling team for Slavia Sport Club in Sofia, under his head coach Simeon Shcherev. Kochev made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's super heavyweight division (130 kg). He lost his opening match to Cuba's Alexis Rodríguez without receiving a single point on the morning session, but pulled off a 1–1 draw to tame Mongolia's Dolgorsürengiin Sumyaabazar at the end of the round-robin. Finishing second in the prelim pool and twelfth overall, Kochev's performance fell short to put him further into the quarterfinals. When his nation Bulgaria hosted the 2001 World Wrestling Championships in Sofia, Kochev lowered his weight to less than a hundred kilograms to compete in the 97-kg division. Despite being brought by the massive roar of the home crowd, Kochev suffered a disappointing defeat from Russia's Giorgi Gogshelidze (who later represented Georgia in two Olympic Games) in the final match 0–3, but luckily picked up a silver medal for the host nation. Two years later, at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, Kochev came strong with a bronze medal effort in the 96-kg division, which effectively earned him a ticket to his second Olympics. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Kochev qualified for his second Bulgarian squad, as a 30-year-old, in the men's heavyweight class (96 kg) by placing third and receiving a berth from the World Championships. Unlike his previous Olympics, Kochev made an embarrassing exit with two straight defeats from Kyrgyzstan's Aleksey Krupnyakov (2–3) and Uzbekistan's Magomed Ibragimov (0–3), leaving him on the bottom of the pool and finishing seventeenth overall in the final standings."

  "text" : "Kevin Avruch is Dean of the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University. He is the Henry Hart Rice Professor of Conflict Resolution and Professor of Anthropology. He received his PhD in Anthropology from the University of California, San Diego in 1978, where he also received his MA in Anthropology in 1973. He received his AB from the University of Chicago. Dr. Avruch joined the faculty at George Mason University in 1980 after teaching at the University of Illinois and the University of California, San Diego. He has also taught at the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies at the University of Malta, the Kroc School of Peace Studies at the University of San Diego, the United Nations University for Peace in Costa Rica as well as for the Program in Conflict Resolution at Sabancı University in Istanbul. In 2011 he was a Fulbright specialist at the Banaras Hindu University. Dr. Avruch is notable for his contributions to the developing field of Conflict Analysis and Resolution and has championed the importance of culture in understanding conflict. His work provided a counterbalance to the search for grand theories of human behavior and highlights the need for attending to particularities of culture in conflict analysis and conflict resolution. Together with Peter W. Black, another anthropologist at George Mason University, Avruch critiqued John Burton's theory of Basic Human Needs, asserting that it needed to recognize the fact that needs are understood and met differently in different cultures."

The name Kuno Goda is a pseudonym, borrowed in part from Konrad Zuse, creator of the first working computer and a painter under the guise “Kuno See”. With a degree in engineering, most of Goda's works relate to technology in some way. He owes his foray into the international art scene to the digital currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum. His work \"200 Bitcoins\" was inspired by Andy Warhol's \"200 One Dollar Bills\" and is regarded to be the first contemporary artwork for digital currency. The work is dedicated to anonymous bitcoin protocol creator Satoshi Nakamoto. In March 2014 the work was sold to a Seattle businessman for an undisclosed amount. The Wall Street Journal reported a selling price of $125.000 but the artist later clarified that the price was much lower.  The Ethereum-related work \"Glideth\" features all four permutations of the renowned hacker emblem the \"Glider\", hand-printed on a copper-clad plate. The artwork sold for $4500 to a private collector in September 2015.On World Press Freedom Day 2016 he published a book called \"Tell All - How To Bypass Media Censorship\". As a commentary to book censorship, the book itself is 90% blacked out."

  "text" : "Kunihiko Obata (小幡 邦彦 Obata Kunihiko, born October 17, 1980 in Hōfu, Yamaguchi) is a retired amateur Japanese freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's middleweight category. He achieved top eight finishes in the 74-kg division at the Asian Games (2002 and 2006), scored two bronze medals at the 2001 and 2004 Asian Wrestling Championships, and also represented his nation Japan at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Before his sporting career ended in late 2006, Obata trained as part of the men's freestyle wrestling squad at Yamanashi Gakuin University under his coach and mentor Yuji Takada. Obata emerged into the global spotlight by taking home the bronze medal in the 76-kg division at the 2001 Asian Wrestling Championships in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. He also entered the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea as one of the heavy medal favorites in the middleweight category, but left empty-handed with a seventh-place finish. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Obata qualified for his first Japanese squad in the men's 74 kg class. Earlier in the process, he rounded out the top ten spots at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, and then guaranteed his spot on the Japanese team by placing third from the Asian Championships in Tehran, Iran. He easily ousted India's Sujeet Maan on his opening match 8–0, but could not resemble a scoring margin to turn down Cuba's Iván Fundora on the mat in his second bout. Placing second in the prelim pool and twelfth in the final standings, Obata's performance fell short to put him further into the quarterfinals. At the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, Obata notched a pair of two easy victories in the same tournament, but could not score enough points to dismantle Uzbekistan's Soslan Tigiev for the bronze medal 0–4, dropping him to fifth."

  "text" : "Kaylin Whitney (born March 9, 1998) is an American track and field athlete, specializing in sprinting events. Over a two-day period, at the USATF Junior Championships in Eugene, Oregon, July 5 and 6, 2014, she set the world youth bests for 100 meters and 200 meters. Her 100-meter time, set on July 5 was 11.10 with an aiding wind of +0.9 mps. Her 200-meter time was 22.49 was set on July 6 with an aiding wind of +1.3. Youth bests can be set by athletes who will not reach their 18th birthday within the calendar year of competition. Her \"bests\" will also count as bests on the continental and national level. Her 100 meters time also sets the national high school record as recognized by Track and Field News, though it will not be recognized by the NFHS as the USATF Junior Championships are not a high school competition. When published (the approval process by the magazine), the 200 meter record will be notated as a \"low altitude\" record by T&FN. Allyson Felix did run a faster 200 meters 22.11 at altitude in Mexico City before graduating from Los Angeles Baptist High School in 2003. Olympic gold medalist Felix is just one of the who's who of Olympians Whitney surpassed with the various records. Also on the list, the World Youth best in the 100 was held by Chandra Cheeseborough, the 200 best was held by Marion Jones, and the high school 100m record was held by Angela Williams. At the time of her performance, her 200-meter time ranked her as the #8 time of the year against all women of any age, her 100m ranked #17. While still a sophomore at East Ridge High School in Clermont, Florida, she was the 2014 Florida state champion in both events. As a youth athlete, Whitney was a star before reaching high school. In 2012, she set the American age 14 records in both the 100m and 200m in similar fashion, a day apart, destroying the youth records of future Olympic gold medalist, Sanya Richards. She trains with an elite group of athletes which includes Olympic gold medalist Justin Gatlin called Star Athletics coached by Olympic gold medalist Dennis Mitchell. She was Track and Field News \"High School Athlete of the Year\" in 2014."

  "text" : "Katarzyna Juszczak (born March 4, 1972 in Wrocław) is a retired amateur Polish-Italian judoka and freestyle wrestler, who competed in the women's heavyweight category. She achieved top eight finishes in the 72-kg division at the World Championships (2002 and 2005), and also participated in two editions of the Olympic Games (1992 and 2004) under different banners. Starting her sporting career as a judoka for AZS-AWF Wrocław, Juszczak made her official debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where she competed in the women's 72 kg division. She ousted Ecuador's María Cangá in her opening match, before losing out to eventual Olympic champion Kim Mi-Jung of South Korea by a powerful ippon within ten seconds. When Juszczak emigrated to Italy in 1999, she turned her sights to women's wrestling, and later trained full-time for Messina Wrestling Club (Italian: Club Lotta Messina) under her personal coach Francesco Costa. Twelve years after her last Olympics, Juszczak qualified for her fresh Italian squad in the women's 72 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, she finished second from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Madrid, Spain to guarantee her place on the Italian wrestling team. She lost two straight matches each to eventual Olympic champion Wang Xu of China (0–5) and Canada's Christine Nordhagen (2–5), that left her on the bottom of the prelim pool, placing eleventh in the final standings."

She started acting at the age of four years when her mother got her involved in a local amateur dramatic group and continued to enjoy performing as she was growing up. She attended the Netherhall School and Long Road Sixth Form College, both in Cambridge. In trying to decide on a career, however, she chose to follow her interest in marine biology, and she enrolled in Aberystwyth University in Wales to study zoology. She completed her course of study and received her degree but realized she did not have the drive to pursue this career. She discovered and joined the Cambridge Filmmakers Network (CFN) and established her company, Actors at Work Productions in 2003. It was through the CFN she became directly involved in her first two film projects."

He had his early schooling at Kanayam and Vatanamkurissi, but, being a poor student, had to drop out of school at Grade 7. He joined Kerala Kalamandalam, in 1965, at the age of 14, to learn Kathakali. During that period, the renowned Koodiyattam maestro, Painkulam Raman Chakyar, was in the process of setting up the Koodiyattam department at Kalamandalam and, on the insistence of Vallathol Narayana Menon, the founder of the institute, and K. N. Pisharody, Sivan changed his course to study Koodiyattam, as one of the two students of the first batch of Koodiyattam. Sivan was fortunate to learn the art from the masters such as Painkulam Raman Chakyar, Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair (Kathakali thespian), and Kalamandalam Krishnankutty Poduval (Chenda exponent). After the initial study of 6 years, Sivan enrolled for the post graduate course of 2 years at Kalamandalam. This was followed by an advanced course in New Delhi, with the help of a scholarship from the Department of Culture, Government of India. In 1975, he joined Kerala Kalamandalam as an instructor in the Faculty of Koodiyattam and, at present, is the most experienced teacher there. In 1980, University of Calicut invited him to be a part of the School of Drama where is working as a visiting professor since then. Sivan Namboodiri is married to Indira, Sanskrit teacher at a local school and the couple has two children. The family lives in Thrissur."

When in 1806 Saxony supported Napoleon, he took part in battles on the French side. Watzdorf was an envoy in 1812 and 1813 in Vienna, where he signed a treaty of alliance with Austria on behalf of Saxony, which no longer supported the French. He acted as an intermediary from 1813 to 1815 between Dresden and Berlin, where he was imprisoned by Saxon king Frederick Augustus I of Saxony. Unsuccessfully sought his release, then sent the same request to the rulers of Prussia, Russia, and Austria, also to no avail. He later toured London, Frankfurt, and Paris, arguing that Saxony was not an enemy of the victorious countries, and entered into an alliance with Napoleon of necessity. He gave a great contribution to restoring Saxon relations with coalition countries. Later he was entrusted with the education of successors to the Saxon throne. He served as envoy from 1827 to 1834 in Berlin, where in 1834 signed a customs contract with Prussia, upon which was built after the German Customs Union (Zollverein). In 1835, Watzdorf was appointed Minister of the Royal House. He died in Dresden."

He studied theology and philology at the University of Halle, afterwards working as a schoolteacher at the Francke Foundations (Halle). In 1831 he was named director of the gymansium in Quedlinburg, later transferring to Göttingen as successor to Friedrich August Grotefend as director of its gymnasium. In 1841 he became a professor at the University of Göttingen, and during the following year, was appointed director of the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium in Berlin. As a director of gymnasiums, he made important contributions towards the educational-methodical reorganization of the Prussian education system. In the field of classical philology, he was the author of significant works on Hesiod, Aristophanes, Xenophon, et al. He also published biographies on classical scholars Karl Otfried Müller (1870) and August Meineke (1871)."

  "text" : "Konstantinos Arkoudeas (Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Αρκουδέας; born March 31, 1973 in Athens) is a retired amateur Greek Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's welterweight category. He won a silver medal in the 62-kg division at the 1993 Mediterranean Games in Languedoc-Roussillon, France, and also represented his nation Greece in two editions of the Olympic Games (1992 and 2004). Before his retirement from wrestling came in 2005, Arkoudeas trained throughout his sporting career as a member of the wrestling team for Ethnikos Sport Club in Piraeus, under his personal coach and father Panagiotis Arkoudeas. Arkoudeas made his official debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where he placed ninth in the men's bantamweight category (62 kg), surpassing over Germany's Mario Büttner by default due to injury. Twelve years after his last Olympics, Arkoudeas qualified for his second Greek squad, as a 31-year-old veteran, in the men's 66 kg class when Greece hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. He filled up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling and the Hellenic Olympic Committee, as Greece received an automatic berth for being the host nation. By the massive clamor of the home crowd inside Ano Liossia Olympic Hall, Arkoudeas started the prelim pool with a smooth 9–3 victory over U.S. wrestler Oscar Wood, before losing his next match 1–4 to Kazakhstan's Mkhitar Manukyan. In his final match against Germany's Jannis Zamanduridis, Arkoudeas pulled from a 2–2 tie to thrash the German in overtime with another point in his score, but fell short to advance further to the quarterfinals, finishing second from the prelim pool. Arkoudeas originally matched the same position from his previous Olympic stint in the final standings, but two wrestlers were both disqualified by a forfeit in a playoff, upgrading him to seventh."

At age 15, Fetters became the youngest woman in Iowa sentenced to life in prison without parole on December 18, 1995. Following the 2012 Supreme Court decision of Miller v. Alabama, which declared mandatory life sentences for juvenile offenders to be unconstitutional, Fetters became the first inmate in Iowa to be re-sentenced in November 2013. The following month, she was recommended for compassionate parole due to a prognosis of inoperable stage-four breast cancer, and she was released to a hospice care center in Des Moines, Iowa in December 2013. She succumbed to her cancer in July 2014, at age 34."

After earning his magister, he taught at the university, as well as that the parochial school attached to the Church of St. Anne in Kraków, where he also served as rector. He returned briefly to Poznań in 1547, leaving two years later for Padua where he earned a medical degree in 1551. Back in Poland he was the doctor of primate Mikołaj Dzierzgowski until the latter's death in 1552, at which point Goski set up his own medical practice in Poznań. As an astrologer, Goski achieved some fame for having correctly predicted the victory of the Holy League over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. Gorski served as mayor of Poznań in 1555–1557, 1563, 1565, and 1574–1575, and as wójt in 1569 and 1573. In 1556-57 he represented the city at the Warsaw sejm, and again at both of the elections sejms in 1572–1576. A wealthy man throughout his life, he owned a house on the Old Market Square (Stary rynek) in Poznań Old Town. Kasper Gorski died in Poznań on 25 November 1576."

  "text" : "Kate Downie (born 1958) is a United States-born Scottish artist who works in painting, printmaking and drawing. She is known for her landscape painting, and her works are held by Glasgow's main public galleries. Downie was born in North Carolina in 1958, to a Scottish father and English mother. She came to Scotland with her family when she was seven. She studied art in Aberdeen, and worked in several countries thereafter, including the United States and Holland, but is based in Edinburgh and known for her works portraying the Scottish landscape. Downie works in a range of media, including oil and acrylic painting, ink painting, collage, and lithography From 2004 to 2006, Downie was President of the Society of Scottish Artists. In 2005 she was shortlisted for the Jerwood Drawing Prize. In the late 2000s, she created Coast Road Diaries, documenting a two-year journey around Scotland; the works formed a travelling exhibition that was critically acclaimed. A member of the Royal Scottish Academy, in 2010 she travelled to China to study ink painting, returning in 2011 and again in 2013. Works resulting from these residencies were displayed at the Royal Scottish Academic and at the Royal Glasgow Institute's Kelly Gallery. In 2014, Downie was commissioned as an artist-in-residence at the Forth Road Bridge, to create an exhibition and work to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the bridge's construction. She described her role as conducting \"an in-depth interview\" with the structure, in order to gather the information and ideas to inform her work. She also climbed to the top of the structure, and spent two months working in an improvised studio directly under the bridge. Described by journalist Jan Patience as \"sure, deft and fearless\", examples of Downie's art are held in the Glasgow Museums, including figurative works, such as 12 Minute Baby (1993) and urban landscapes such as Blue Night, Yellow Roof (1991). In late September 2014 Downie set off for 3 months of travel in Australia and Japan, carrying out research of river systems, estuaries and bridges on the edge of the western Pacific Ocean. This culminated in a 2nd major solo exhibition with the Scottish Gallery ‘Estuary’ in Edinburgh in April 2015. That same month also featured a two-person show ‘Drawing on the Landscape’ at Cobalt Contemporary in Pittenweem. Both shows were a great success, with reviews by the Times, The Scotsman and Studio International. In 2016, Shared Vision, a wall of eight works were exhibited as part of the 190th Royal Scottish Academy Annual Exhibition. This set of appropriated ink paintings were featured in the touring show of the same title, which opened at Stirling University in September 2015, then toured to Robert Gordon’s University in early 2016. As one of the invited artists to Cupar Arts Festival 2016 Downie works on an installation in a section of the former Sheriff Court Building Gentitledaps, Distortions and Downright Lies. Other artists included in Festival 2016, include (but not only) Charles Avery, Juliana Capes, Pier Guiseppe DiTanno, Juliette Losq, David Faithfull, Rachel Maclean, Jenny Smith and Anthony Schrag."

Vijavargiya was appointed BJP's election in-charge for Haryana's Assembly Polls in 2014, after which BJP romped to an absolute majority in the assembly election. This victory ensured that he would be given more important roles in the near future on central level and was proved when in June 2015, he was appointed as National General Secretary by Party President Amit Shah. And as expected, after his performance in Haryana, he was appointed as the new in-charge of the party in West Bengal."

She carried out an extensive anthropological study in the Kono district of Sierra Leone. Hardin was born in Fresno, California, daughter of Douglas and Eleanor Hardin. She was awarded a PhD in anthropology from Indiana University, a Fulbright scholarship, a Rockefeller scholarship, and a fellowship by the Smithsonian Institution. Following completion of her formal study, she spent several years doing fieldwork amongst the Kono people of Kainkordu, a Chiefdom of Sierra Leone in the Kono District. Upon her return from Sierra Leone, she met, and later married, writer and photographer Michael Katakis, with whom she spent 25 years collaborating on projects throughout the world. Together, they produced exhibitions and books derived from their work. In 2009 the results of their activities, comprising thousands of pages of field notes and photographs, were presented to the British Library. Interviews were held which included a joint interview with Katakis and Hardin and two individual life story interviews. An exhibition, 'Michael Katakis Photographs', was held in the British Library, which featured photographs from the projects 'The Vietnam Veterans Memorial', 'Troubled Land: 12 Days Across America' (a portrait of the US in the days after the September 11 attacks) and 'A Time and Place Before War', which documented life in Sierra Leone before the outbreak of Sierra Leone Civil War in 1991). Hardin was a painter who produced work in oil and watercolor. In 1999 she was elected Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and in 2011 she was presented to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth. Hardin died on August 21, 2012 as a result of brain tumor."

He and Chris Corbould were nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects for their work on Quantum of Solace (2008). Haug began in the film industry in the 1970s as a motion control programmer. In the 1980s, he became involved with video productions that began using computer-generated effects. In the following decade, he worked on visual effects for television commercials and for two music videos directed by Mark Romanek. Haug's first role as visual effects supervisor came with The Game when one of its producers Cean Chaffin hired him. Haug was active as a visual effects supervisor from 1997 through 2003 before he decided to do more modest visual effects work for independent film directors. He worked as visual effects designer for Marc Forster on the 2004 film Finding Neverland. Haug said the position was similar to production designer in how it had greater involvement earlier in a film's production rather than at the end. Haug was also one of the founders of the production service FX Cartel."

  "text" : "Kim Shillinglaw (born 1969) is a British media executive. She is the director of factual programming at Endemol Shine UK. A former controller of BBC Two and BBC Four. Following the merger of the BBC's channel controller posts in January 2016, Shillinglaw was made redundant. Shillinglaw spent her early years in Cameroon and Spain, countries in which her parents worked during the 1970s. After her family's return to Britain, she attended Holland Park Comprehensive and then read history at Wadham College, Oxford. After her graduation, she joined Observer Films in 1990 (for a time part of the Guardian Media Group) as a researcher, eventually becoming a series producer. Following this, Shillinglaw worked for ITV and Channel 4. From 2006, Shillinglaw worked as an executive producer for BBC London Factual and the commissioner of independent productions for CBBC. Working under Karen O'Connor from late 2007, she then became one of ten \"creative leads\" in London Factual. From May 2009, she was the BBC's commissioning editor for science and natural history responsible around 2012 for 200 hours of programming per year. The proportion of science broadcasting on BBC One is reported to have risen during Shillinglaw's period in charge of the department. During 2012 and 2013, she was executive producer of Bang Goes the Theory. Shillinglaw assumed her posts as controller of both BBC Two and BBC Four in April 2014 in succession to Janice Hadlow. During her period as the 13th, and final, controller of BBC Two, Shiilinglaw is reported to have increased the hours of science on the channel as well as the number of female presenters and experts on screen. Shillinglaw was reported less keen to commission programmes about environmental issues. The posts of BBC One, BBC Two and BBC Four controllers were abolished by the BBC's director general Tony Hall in January 2016, with the then BBC One controller Charlotte Moore being appointed to the overall post. In was announced that Shillinglaw was leaving the BBC, but according to The Guardian, it was intended that she would work through her six-month notice period. In July 2016, Shillinglaw was appointed as the first director of factual programming at Endemol Shine UK. Shillinglaw is married to the television producer Steve Condie who has worked on Newsnight and other programmes. The couple live in West London and have two children."

There he helped establish the first Canadian Studies program in Ontario. After attending a speech by Canadian publishing icon Jack McClelland, Howard, who had been frustrated by the lack of books on Canadian history, made the decision to venture into publishing.

He received a degree from the University of Copenhagen in Film and Media Studies and the London Contemporary Dance School where he studied choreography with Nina Fonaroff. He began working as a choreographer in 1983, and in 1985 founded his own dance company, Arc Dance Company. He has worked with a number of companies including New York City Ballet, The Royal Ballet, The Royal Danish Ballet, English National Ballet, and the Rambert Dance Company among others - as well as extensive work in theatre, opera and film, drawing on his cinematic training to forge his unique narrative style. Over the last two and a half decades, Brandstrup has established his name as one of the leading narrative choreographers of his generation, a dance maker with a natural instinct for telling stories. For Brandstrup telling stories and addressing serious subjects has always been combined - “telling stories connects us” as he has once said “to our shared humanity”. When he decided to switch his studies to dance, at the late age of 19, what motivated him was the belief that this new art form offered him a language with an even greater immediacy and universality than film."

  "text" : "Kurt Lundqvist (20 November 1914 – 26 March 1976) was a Swedish track and field athlete who competed in the high jump. He was the 1938 European champion in the event. He won his first national title in 1933 and established himself as the top Swedish competitor that decade with four further wins at the Swedish Athletics Championships from 1935 to 1938, interrupted only by Nils Bergström. He featured in the top three nationally in 1939, 1941 and 1942. A Swedish record came for Lundqvist in 1937 – his jump of 1.98 m (6 ft 5 3⁄4 in) improved Karl Österberg's twelve-year-old mark. In the only major tournament outing of his international career, he won the gold medal at the 1938 European Athletics Championships in Paris in a near-personal best of 1.97 m (6 ft 5 1⁄2 in). His win at the second edition of this competition marked the beginning of a period of Swedish dominance in that event, with Anton Bolinder, Bengt Nilsson and Rickard Dahl maintaining the European title for Sweden at four of the following five editions. Lundqvist was also Sweden's first ever European champion in a jumping event and the second Swedish European field medallist after Harald Andersson. For his achievements he was given the Stora grabbars märke for athletics (the 87th recipient of the award). He did not compete in a major event after 1938 and the onset of World War II the year after ended chance at further high level sports competition."

Born in Basel, Switzerland, he was a member of FC Freiburg sports club and chose to compete internationally for Germany. His first success at national level came in 1937, when he was runner-up at the German Athletics Championships to Julius Müller. He only reached the national podium on one more occasion, in 1939 when he was second to Austria's Josef Haunzwickel (who competed due to the Anschluss). In spite of his failure to claim a national title in his career, he was the winner at the 1938 European Athletics Championships. Following in the footsteps of his compatriot Gustav Wegner (the 1934 winner), he defeated Bo Ljungberg and won in a championship record mark of 4.05 m (13 ft 3 1⁄4 in). Given the onset of World War II, he did not compete at any further international athletics competitions and the European gold medal remained the highlight of his short career. Sutter died in 2003 in Spandau, Berlin."

  "text" : "Sharon Lou \"Kerri\" Sanborn (born July 29, 1946) is an American bridge player from New York City. She has won major tournaments as Kerri Davis and Kerri Shuman as well. Sometime prior to the 2014 European and World meets (summer and October), Sanborn ranked 25th among 73 living Women World Grand Masters by world masterpoints (MP) and 7th by placing points that do not decay over time. As Kerri Shuman during 1974, Sanborn earned the greatest number of masterpoints in American Contract Bridge League-sanctioned play, and thus won the ACBL McKenney Trophy. No woman since then has won the annual masterpoints race, which is now recognized by the Barry Crane Trophy after her longtime masterpoints partner Barry Crane. Sanborn (as Shuman) and Crane won the World Bridge Federation's third quadrennial World Mixed Pairs Championship in 1978. In 1990 she was the only woman invited to compete in a special WBF par contest for individuals; in effect, an examination set by experts for experts. Sanborn was inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 2007. Sanborn was one of 24 women, six from each of four countries (as for men), invited to participate in the SportAccord World Mind Games, December 2011 in Beijing. Her partner was Irina Levitina, at least for the Pairs. Sanborn and Jack Zhao of China, who sometimes lives and frequently plays in North America, won the 13th quadrennial World Mixed Pairs Championship in Sanya, China, October 2014. Thus she became the first player to win the gold medal twice, and he became the first player from outside Europe and North America to win any medal."
