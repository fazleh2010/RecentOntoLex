  "text" : "Lokagrani Adv. Balwantrao Ragav alias Balasaheb Deshmukh was one of the political leaders who become famous not only in Chandrapur but also in whole vidharbha by his imbibed qualities & devotion. He was a prominent leader of Tilak era. He was born on 27 March 1878 at Chandrapur. He studied at Chandrapur for his primary & pre secondary education. There after he shifted to Nagpur for his High school & his college education. He took his law degree from Calcutta university in 1899. The then British government offered him a post of a Judge, however he refused to accept the same & started legal profession on 29 October 1900 at Chandrapur & became famous as a renowned lawyer of Vidharbha & Maharashtra. Balwantrao never intended to be a professional lawyer only & hence he entered the Indian independence movement & became active in the politics. He imbibed the aspiration of freedom in the minds of the people & awoke them to fight against the British raj. He accepted the leadership of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak & admired him to be his political leader & guru. He always called Lokmanya Tilak as Bhagawan Tilak. He propagated the ideology of Lokmanya Tilak & called on the people to accept his principles of Swadeshi, Bycot, Swarajya & National Education. In 1906 he attended the annual session of Indian National Congress held under the President-ship of the then political leader Shri. Dadabhai naurojee along with Adv. Nilkantharao Sadaphal, Adv. Dajiba Ganesh Dewaikar & Dajishrashtri Chandekar. He also used to observe the Ganesh jayanti & Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj jayanti in order to assemble the people & propagate the idea of Independence among the people. Lokmanaya Tilak had visited Chandrapur for attending the Providential Sessions of his Swaraj party in 1918. He stayed in the house of Balwantrao Deshmukh. After his heroic welcome by the people, Balwantrao gave a dinner in honour of Lokmanay Tilak & other political leaders Viz Dadasaheb Khaperday, Nikalhantrao Khadilkar & N.H Kelkar & Others, Who came to attain the provential session at Chandrapur. During the evening time Lokmamaya Tilak addressed the people of Chandrapur. The session lasted for 3 days & during this period Chandrapur became the center place of the whole province in respect of the political activities. Prior to that, after his release from Mandale Prison in 1914, Lokmanya Tilak formed his Swaraj party & held its session at Belgaon, which was also attended among the other prominent leaders including Balwantrao Deshmukh, who was then considered to be a very close & faithful associate of Lokmanaya Tilak. In 1919 when Lokmamya Tilak left Mumbai for his tour to England, Balwantrao Deshmukh was one of those 10 Leaders who were given a permission to see off Balwantrao at the deck of the ship which was bound for a voyage to London. In the year 1917, Dr. Annie Besant started the Home Rule League Movement in India. Balwantrao actively supported this movement & propagated the ideology of this movement in Chandrapur & Vidharbha. After the sad demise of Lokmanya Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi took the political charge of the freedom movement & unanimously decided to launch the Non - cooperative movement in India against British rule. Balwantrao Deshmukh supported the same & along with some other lawyers of Chandrapur, boycotted the Court for about 1 year. In the Year 1919-20 Balwantrao was Unanimously selected as president C.P. and Berar Congress Committee. During his tenure he held four sessions of providential committee at distinct places. Mahatma Gandhi attended one such sessions held under the presidency of Balawantrao Deshmukh. During the period 1919 to 1923 Balwantrao Deshmukh was a member of All India Congress Committee. In 1921 he was elected as a member of the Provincial assembly & thus worked as M.L.A. for about 5 years. He was a very clever & famous Lawyer in whole of Maharashtra for conducting criminal Cases. Because of his efforts the political leaders like Pandit Motilal Nehru, Bhai Parmanandanji, Sir Tegbahhadur Sapru, V.D Sawarkar, Kahnayalala Munshi, Br. Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee, Dr. Narang, Dharmaveer Bhopatkar, Pandit Ravishankar Shukla, Br. N.V Gadgil, Jayantrao tilak had visited Chandrapur. In the year 1942 during the \"Quit India Movement\" the people of Chimur thesil Chandrapur assembled in front of Police Station Chimur under the leadership of Rashtra Sant Tukodaji Maharaj. The people attacked the police station & burned some of the policeman. The area of Chimur was free from British rule for about four days. The British army came to Chimur & took charge of the area. They arrested many people under the charges of unlawful assembly, arson and Decoity. A special court was created at Chandrapur for trying the accused persons. Balwantrao arranged to defend all the political accused & further arranged for the residence of the relatives of the accused during their trial in the Court by erecting a pendol in front of his house & made necessary arrangements of their residence & food. Some of the accused were convicted. Their appeals came to be filed before Nagpur High Court. Till then the India got Independence & hence all the accused being political prisnors were pardoned. Balawantrao Deshmukh founded Lokmanya Tilak Smarak Mandal at Chandrapur & got constructed the building of Lokmanya Tilak Vidyalaya, which is considered to be a monument of Lokmanya Tilak in Chandrapur. For the inauguration of the building Balwantrao invited Br. N.V. Gadgil & Br. Jayantrao tilak who was the grandson of Lokmanaya Tilak. In the year 1956 he formed a local committee for awakening the people & giving active support to tho Goa freedom movement. Four youth from Chandrapur decided to take part in the freedom struggle of Goa. One of the youth namely Baburao Thorat was assassinated by Portuguese soldiers as they tried to enter the territory. Balwantrao caused to bring the asthi kalash of Baburao Thorat to Chandrapur & respectfully got those buried in Maulana Azad garden of Chandrapur & erected a Stambh over the same. Prior to that in the year 1937 the then Manciple committee honored Balwantrao Deshmukh on his 60th birthday by giving him a Testimonial. Balwantrao was a very merciful, kindhearted & benevolent person. He never made any distinction between rich & poor,educated & Uneducated, Touchable & untouchable, higher quality & lower quality & treated all the people equally. He had a natural love for poor & Down Trodden people. He was the president of Choka Mela hostel till his death, which was meant for the education of the youth from poor & down Trodden families. He monitored and helped many societies, orphanages, asylums etc. He died at the edge of 80 years on 18 November 1957. Because of his death the people thought as if they have lost their well wisher & a near friend."

  "text" : "Leonard M. Rosen (November 19, 1930 – April 16, 2014) was an American bankruptcy lawyer, and a co-founder of the prominent New York firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Rosen received a business administration degree from the City College of New York in 1951, and a law degree from New York University School of Law in 1954. Rosen's practice focused on representing major institutional lenders in the restructuring and reorganizations of large corporate borrowers. He played a key role in rescuing New York from fiscal crisis in the 1970s, helping the City secure necessary financing when it was on the verge of financial collapse. Rosen assisted in the government bailout of Chrysler in 1980. A group of 15 lending institutions chose Rosen as their special counsel in setting up complicated loans to Chrysler that were guaranteed by the federal government. Rosen served as an adjunct professor of law at NYU Law School for many years. He also served as chairman of the National Bankruptcy Conference from 1984 to 1992, and received the American College of Bankruptcy's Distinguished Service Award in 2003."

He successfully served as an administrator in the Treasury in later years and was appointed as navy commander in early 1676 during the Scanian War. However, his complete lack of naval military experience combined with the generally poor state of the Swedish fleet led to his death on Kronan, the flagship of the navy, at the battle of Öland on 1 June 1676. Creutz married the friherrinna (roughly baroness) Elsa Duwall (1620–1675), daughter of general Jakob MacDougall (ennobled as \"Duvall\") and Anna von der Berge."

  "text" : "Lisa Lapinski (born in 1967 in Palo Alto, California) is an American visual artist who creates dense, formally complex sculptures which utilize both the language of traditional craft and advanced semiotics. Her uncanny objects interrogate the production of desire and the exchange of meaning in an image-based society. Discussing a group show in 2007, New York Times Art Writer Holland Cotter noted, \"An installation by Lisa Lapinski carries a hefty theory- studies title: 'Christmas Tea-Meeting, Presented by Dialogue and Humanism, Formerly Dialectics and Humanism.' But the piece itself just looks breezily enigmatic.\" It is often remarked that viewers of Lapinski's sculptures are enticed into an elaborate set of ritualistic decodings. In a review of her work published in ArtForum, Michael Ned Holte noted, \"At such moments, it becomes clear that Lapinski's entire systemic logic is less circular than accumulative: What at first seems hermetically sealed is often surprisingly generous upon sustained investigation.\" Lapinski's work has been exhibited widely in the US and Europe, and she was included in the 2006 Whitney Biennial."

  "text" : "Louise Massey (born Victoria Louise Massey: 10 August 1902 – 20 June 1983 in San Angelo, Texas), American singer and songwriter born in Midland, Texas. The Massey family left Texas while Louise Massey was very young and she grew up near Roswell in Lincoln County, New Mexico. In 1918, Louise's father, Henry Massey, started a band that featured himself and three of his eight children singing and playing musical instruments. Most of the children played were able to play several instruments while dressed in “elaborate cowboy outfits as their stage attire,” Louise played piano and sang. The Massey’s music career began in 1920s, when they played and sang at local shows and church socials. At the age of 15, Louise married Milton Mabie, who also joined the group. In 1930, the quintet known as \"the Westerners\" included Louise, Curt and Allen Massey, Milton Mabie, and Larry Wellington, who had replaced Henry Massey. Louise, with her flamboyant Spanish-style costumes, became the focal point of the act and received lead billing. The Westerners first radio performance was on KMBC in Kansas City. They moved to WLS Radio in Chicago in 1933. In 1934, the song \"When the White Azaleas Start Blooming\" was released by the band and sold three million copies. In 1936, they moved to New York where they continued their radio work on NBC. In 1938, Louise Massey and the Westerners appeared in the Tex Ritter movie Where the Buffalo Roam. The group returned to WLS Radio in 1939 and did a morning broadcast on NBC called \"Reveille Roundup.\" In the early 1940s, the Westerners were \"well known for numerous radio appearances\" and were appearing on Plantation Party broadcasts three nights a week. Louise Massey recorded for several record labels including Vocalion Records, OKeh Records, and Conqueror Records. Massey's house in Roswell is listed on the National Register of Historic Places."

He was the paternal grandfather of German chancellor Angela Merkel, whose birth name Kasner is the Germanized version of Kaźmierczak that Ludwig Kasner adopted in 1930. In 2013, he received significant media attention, in Poland and Germany, after a new book shed light on Merkel's family background. This was not only due to his being of Polish origin, but also because Kasner's nephew provided a photograph of him in the uniform of the Blue Army (also known as Haller's Army) which fought for Poland's independence in the late stages of World War I."

He directed the short film Libertários, winner of Margarida de Prata Award from the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil, in 1976. In 1978, he would win again the Gramado Film Festival Best Cinematography Award for his work on Héctor Babenco's Lúcio Flávio, o Passageiro da Agonia. His first feature film, Sonho sem Fim, won the Jury Special Award at the 1986 Gramado Film Festival. Ironweed (1987), another Babenco's film, would make him more known internationally."

  "text" : "Luis S. Kemnitzer (November 13, 1928 – February 17, 2006) was an American anthropologist known for his social and political activism. Kemnitzer was born in Pasadena, California. From 1967 to 1994, Kemnitzer was a professor at San Francisco State University, where in 1969 he taught that institution's first course in American Indian Studies. In this role, Kemnitzer visited Alcatraz Island during its occupation—which had been partially planned in his classroom, and among whose participants were some of his students (including Richard Oakes) — to provide logistical advice on how to set up educational programs for Native American children on the island. Kemnitzer began his academic career in the 1940s, studying public health at the University of California, Berkeley, but withdrew to become a brakeman on the Southern Pacific Railroad. His experiences in the labor force led him to join the Communist Party USA. In the 1960s, he earned his doctorate in anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania, after writing a dissertation based on his experiences living among the Oglala Lakota on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. He subsequently became director of the Lakota Language and Culture Center. His published research included: studies of syncretism among the Lakota; analysis of railroad workers' time perception, and an examination of needle exchange programmes. As an activist, Kemnitzer helped establish the first needle exchange programme in San Francisco's Tenderloin district; he also attempted to distribute condoms to Bohemian Grove attendees. In 2005, Kemnitzer and his partner Moher Downing posed naked for the 2006 \"Hotties of Harm Reduction\" calendar; the 2007 calendar was dedicated to his memory. In 1997, Kemnitzer, who had for many years been an avid record collector, helped create the liner notes for the Smithsonian Folkways Recordings reissue of Anthology of American Folk Music (originally compiled by Harry Everett Smith, with whom Kemnitzer had been friends); Kemnitzer subsequently shared in the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Album Notes."

  "text" : "Louis R. Lautier (1897-1962) was the first African-American journalist admitted to the White House Correspondents' Association. Lautier was born in New Iberia, Louisiana, in 1897. He attended Straight College (later Dillard University) in New Orleans, Morris Brown College in Atlanta, from which he received an A.B. and an honorary LL.D., and studied at Howard Law School in Washington. The U.S. Department of Justice employed him as a legal stenographer and at the same time he also reported for various African American newspapers. His reporting focused largely on segregation in Washington and the federal government. In 1945, Lautier became Washington correspondent for the National Negro Publishers Association, which provided news stories to the black press. He covered White House press conferences but could not get a Congressional press pass. The Standing Committee of Correspondents, a group of reporters that decided on credentials for the Senate and House press galleries, rejected his application because his client papers were mostly weeklies and the press gallery admitted only reporters for daily papers. In 1947, Lautier took his case to the Senate Rules Committee, whose chairman, Illinois Senator C. Wayland Brooks, ordered the gallery to admit him. Lautier became the first black reporter in the press galleries since the 1870s. He became a member of the White House Correspondents Association in 1951 and began attending their annual dinners two years later. In 1955, Lautier applied for membership in the National Press Club. Division within the membership was so intense that Press Club held its only referendum on admitting him. He was approved by a vote of 377 to 281. Lautier retired from the NNPA in 1961 to become special assistant to the chairman of the Republican National Committee and to write a column, “Looking at the Record,” which the RNC distributed to the black press. He died of a heart attack on May 6, 1962."

  "text" : "Leslie Wilkinson was a professor of architecture at University of Sydney. He was born on the 12th of October 1882 at New Southgate, Middlesex, England and died on the 20th of September 1973 at Vaucluse. His whole life was dedicated to architecture as both an academic and practising architect. Wilkinson was the founding dean of the faculty of architecture at University of Sydney in 1920. His ideals on architecture as a form of art had strongly influenced both the school and its students. The emphasis on the teaching of philosophy and practice of design was at the time a frontier in architecture education. Wilkinson was never a part of the modern architecture movement. His work, both as a teacher and practising architect, was consistently involved only with traditional architecture, which was inspired by Australian's colonial heritage and Mediterranean architecture. This is contributed by his background training at the Royal Academy of Arts and his study tours in France, Italy, Spain and Great Britain. Wilkinson's influential work is seen in residential, church and University of Sydney master plan."

  "text" : "Lois Rhame West (September 5, 1921 – May 6, 2014) was an American health and physical fitness advocate, activist, and philanthropist. She served as First Lady of South Carolina from 1971 until 1975 during the administration of her husband, former Governor John C. West. Rhame West, a former faculty member at the University of South Carolina, made physical education and wellness the focus of her tenure as the state's First Lady. West later became the first woman serve as president of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, a position she held for two terms. She served on the Muscular Dystrophy Association's national board of directors for forty years. West was born Lois Rhame on September 5, 1921, in Camden, South Carolina to Boykin W. and Annie L. Rhame. She graduated from Camden High School in 1939. She enrolled at Winthrop College, a women's college in Rock Hill, South Carolina, which now known Winthrop University. She studied physical education. (Winthrop later became a co-educational school during the 1970s). She was active in collegiate athletics as a member of the women's field hockey, tennis and golf teams. On August 29, 1942, while still a college student, Rhame married John C. West at a ceremony in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. She became the first Winthrop student to marry while in school and still graduate. Lois West received a bachelor's degree in physical education from Winthrop in 1943, becoming the first married woman to graduate from the college. Lois West joined the faculty of the University of South Carolina, where she taught while her husband completed his law degree. West campaigned statewide for her husband during his 1970 gubernatorial campaign. John West was sworn into office in January 1971 at a time when racial tensions were still high in the state. In his inaugural address, Governor West promised to make South Carolina \"colorblind\" and erase \"any vestige of discrimination\" from his government. His promises drew threats from the state's Ku Klux Klan. Lois West recognized the danger posed by the Klan to her husband. In a 1998 interview for an oral history project at the University of South Carolina, West recalled her reaction, \"If they did something, there were enough Klan members on the grand jury (that) nobody ever got indicted\"...\"The Grand Dragon lived down near me...so I sent him a message that if anything happened to John, he didn't have to worry about the grand jury, because I'd come kill him right then...I said, 'Now you just remember, whether you do it or anybody else does it, I’m going to get four of you before daylight.'...Boy, they were careful about us after that, because they knew I meant it – and I did.\" However, despite the threats, she also noted, \"In the long run, there are more good people than bad people...This is a good state. It’s a nice place to live. Of all the places we’ve been, this is the best.\" West adopted physical fitness and health advocacy as the cornerstone of her tenure as First Lady from 1971 to 1975. She focused much of her work on the importance of physical education. John West was appointed the United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1977 to 1981. Lois West accompanied with him to Saudi Arabia during his tenure. The Wests became some of the first major donors to her alma mater, Winthrop University. Both were active in the transition to a coeducational institution during the 1970s. During the 1980s, the family established the Lois Rhame West Scholars program, which provided full scholarships to South Carolina residents. The university awarded her a Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1984. Lois West served on the national board of directors for the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) for forty years. Her tenure on the board included two terms as the first female president of the Muscular Dystropy Association. She was also a leader in both the state Cub Scouts and the Girl Scouts. In 1998, Lois West and former Governor Carroll Campbell became the co-chairs of Winthrop University's first capital campaign. Under West and Campbell, the campaign brought in more than $30 million, which was utilized for research programs, scholarships, and improvements to the school's academic majors. She was honored as a \"Distinguished Alumni in Physical Education\" in 2001. In 2007, the university opened the Lois Rhame West Health, Physical Education and Wellness Center, the school's first LEED certifiied green building. Named in West's honor, the building houses the offices for several major programs of study, including the departments of physical therapy, sports management, and Sport and Human Performance. Her husband of 61 years, former Governor and Ambassador John C. West, died in 2004. Lois West died at her home in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, on May 6, 2014, at the age of 92. Her funeral was held at Bethesda Presbyterian Church in Camden, South Carolina. She was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, also located in Camden. She was survived by two of her three children, Shelton W. Bosley and John C. West Jr., and eleven grandchildren. She was predecased by her husband, Governor John West, and their son, Douglas Allen West, as well as her four brothers and one sister."

  "text" : "Lela Bliss (May 11, 1896, Los Angeles, California – May 15, 1980, Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California) was an American actress. She made her first silent film, Pretty Mrs. Smith, in 1915 and appeared in at least over 40 movies until the 1960s. Bliss appeared in supporting roles and bit parts in Hollywood films such as The Dark Mirror (1946), Miracle on 34th Street (1947) and Intruder in the Dust (1949). She often played mothers, neighbours or society women. Since the 1950s, Bliss also appeared frequently on popular television shows including The Twilight Zone, Maverick, Mister Ed and The Addams Family. She ended her acting career with a guest role in That Girl in 1967. Lela Bliss was married to the Canadian actor Harry Hayden from 1924 until his death on July 24, 1955, and they had one child together. They ran the Bliss-Hayden School of Acting at 254 South Robertson Boulevard in Beverly Hills, and their students included Veronica Lake and Mamie Van Doren. In 1954, it was acquired by Douglas Frank Bank and Jay Manford. It became the Beverly Hills Playhouse, and is one of the oldest acting schools and theatres in Los Angeles, California."

  "text" : "Luisa or Luigia Sanfelice (1764–1800) was an Italian aristocrat who was executed by Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies because of her involvement with the French-backed Parthenopean Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars although Sanfelice was largely apolitical. As she was generally regarded as the innocent victim of circumstances, she became a legendary figure who was widely portrayed in popular culture. During the nineteenth century she was often depicted as a gentle and naïve beauty whose story closely resembled that of the fictional Fioria Tosca, heroine of the Verdi opera Tosca. Amongst those who depicted Sanfelice was the French writer Alexandre Dumas who wrote the novel La San Felice (1864). In 1874 the artist Giovacchino Toma painted Luisa Sanfelice in Carcere, showing her in captivity before her execution. In the twentieth century Sanfelice appeared in two films Luisa Sanfelice (1942) and Luisa Sanfelice (2004)."

Born as Renato Manganella, he wrote under the pen name of D'Ambra becoming a celebrated journalist, novelist and film critic. A noted film enthusiast, D'Ambra became involved in the cinema in 1911 when he anonymously wrote screenplays. From 1916 he formally entered the film industry, setting up his own production company and directing more than twenty films. His silent comedies drew comparisons to the films of his German contemporary Ernst Lubitsch. In 1922 D'Ambra's company was absorbed into the conglomerate Unione Cinematografica Italiana and he retired from regular filmmaking although he occasionally produced further screenplays. In 1937 he published his memoirs, recounting his time working in Italy's early film industry."

  "text" : "Louis-Guillaume Verrier (October 19, 1690 – September 13, 1758) was a lawyer in the parliament of Paris and attorney general of the Sovereign Council of New France. The son of Guillaume Verrier, king's attorney, and Marie-Madeleine Thibault, he was born in Paris, studied law and was admitted to the bar of Paris in August 1712. After Mathieu-Benoît Collet died in Quebec, Verrier sought to become his replacement and was named to the attorney general position in April 1728. He arrived in New France in September of that year. In 1730, French ministre de la marine Maurepas assigned him the task of examining the minute-books of the notaries of the provost court of Quebec and also compiling a list of any errors in notarial deeds with recommended remedies. In 1732, he was asked to compile a registry of all landed property in New France, a task which took Verrier eight years to complete. He taught courses on law, which are believed to have been the first such courses given in North America. His students included Jean-Victor Varin de la Marre, François Foucault, Jacques de Lafontaine de Belcour, Guillaume Guillimin, René-Ovide Hertel de Rouville, Jean-François Gaultier and Jacques Imbert. Verrier died intestate at Quebec City at the age of 67 and his succession was not settled until January 1776."

  "text" : "Leon Joseph Koerner (May 24, 1892 – September 26, 1972) was a Czechoslovakian-born industrialist and philanthropist in British Columbia. He was born in Nový Hrozenkov in what is now the Czech Republic and was educated at the Export Academy in Vienna, the London School of Economics and the Sorbonne. After serving in World War I, he joined the family lumber company, becoming head of the company in 1920. In 1922, he married Thea Rosenquist. With the rise of the German Third Reich, Koerner's family abandoned their possessions and business interests; he escaped to London, England and then travelled with his wife to North America. In Vancouver, his wife came down with a severe case of the mumps. While his wife was recovering, Koerner acquired a defunct lumber mill in New Westminster. Founding a timber company with his brothers Theodor, Otto, and Walter, he was able to market western hemlock successfully as \"Alaska pine\". The company introduced innovative and progressive practices to the British Columbia forest industry such as selective logging, reforestation, improvements in workplace safety and better wages and benefits. Koerner became a Canadian citizen in 1947. In 1955, he and his wife created a foundation, the Leon and Thea Koerner Foundation, which contributed to education, the creative arts and social programs, particularly in British Columbia. Thea Koerner died in 1959. Leon suffered a stroke in 1966. In May 1972, he suffered a broken hip after a fall and he died later that year at the age of 80 in his penthouse atop the Thea Koerner House Graduate Student Centre of the University of British Columbia. Koerner was inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame in 1983."

In 1999 Leite decided to compete in the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship, Jiu Jitsu’s most important competition, for the first time. He was a brown belt then and was expecting to compete in that division, but his coach “Gigi” Paiva had other plans for him, and two weeks before the event he promoted him to black belt. Leonardo Leite won the competition, winning in the final against a legend in the sport, Mario Sperry. In 2013, he started his MMA career (Record 3-0-0).

  "text" : "Lucy Edith Gullett (28 September 1876 – 12 November 1949) was an Australian medical practitioner and philanthropist. She was born in Hawthorn in Melbourne to journalist Henry Gullett and Lucy, née Willie. Educated at Sydney Girls' High School and the University of Sydney, she was the first resident medical officer at the Crown Street Women's Hospital from 1901 to 1902 and resident surgeon at Brisbane's Hospital for Sick Children from 1902 to 1903. She was a GP at Bathurst from 1906 to 1911, when she returned to Wahroonga to live with her sister Minnie. The sisters campaigned together for mental health reform, but Lucy's medical practice declined as she had less need for income. During World War I she travelled to Europe at her own expense to serve the Red Cross at a military hospital in Lyon. She was a medical officer in Sydney during the influenza epidemic in 1919. From 1918 to 1932 she was an honorary outpatients physician with the Renwick Hospital for Infants, and a she was a councillor of the Sydney District Nursing Association from 1934 to 1949. In 1921 Gullett founded the New South Wales Association of Registered Medical Women, serving as secretary. Together with the president, Harriet Biffen, she took a leading role in establishing the New Hospital for Women and Children, which was renamed the Rachel Forster Hospital for Women and Children in 1925. Gullett resigned as secretary in 1926 but remained involved in the movement, serving as vice-president from 1932 to 1949. She opened the Lucy Gullett Convalescent Home in 1946. In 1932 she ran unsuccessfully as an independent women's candidate for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, contesting the seat of North Sydney; she was elected to the United Associations of Women executive committee in 1935 and served as vice-president from 1936 to 1938 and in 1943. In 1943 Minnie Gullett died and Lucy lived with the cellist June Holland. A long-time sufferer from nephritis, Gullett died in 1949, some months after suffering a stroke."

Dr. Seymour was born in Plymouth England in 1958 and qualified in Biochemistry at the University of Manchester. He later formed a research group focused on gene delivery at the Cancer Research UK Institute in Birmingham, and then relocated to the University of Oxford in 2003 as Gene Therapy lead for the National Translational Cancer Research Network (NTRAC). There, he took part in forming the British Society for Gene Therapy (BSCGT) as a means to build the translational gene and cell therapy community within the UK. Dr. Seymour served as the first President of the BSGCT from 2003–2009, currently serves as the General Secretary of the European Society for Gene and Cell Therapy, is indexed in Who's Who, and has produced approximately 140 primary scientific publications. With Dr. Kerry Fisher, Dr. Seymour formed a biotech spinout company 'Hybrid Systems' which later became ‘PsiOxus Therapeutics Ltd’, with Cancer Research UK and the University of Birmingham. PsiOxus is now developing a cancer-killing 'oncolytic' group B adenovirus 'ColoAd1' in a series of clinical trials to treat cancer. More recently with Dr. Ryan Cawood, Dr. Seymour formed the plasmid expression company Oxford Genetics, aiming to enable major improvements in the efficiency of genetic engineering and synthetic biology."

  "text" : "Lewis Hartsough (born 1828 August 31 in Ithaca, New York – died 1919 January 1 in Mount Vernon, Iowa) was a Methodist evangelist and gospel song writer. In 1853, one year after graduation from Cazenovia Seminary, he was ordained and commenced a 15-year ministry in the Oneida Conference of Upstate New York. He was also cultivating his interest in religious poetry and music, as in 1858 he wrote the lyrics for \"I Love to Sing of Heaven\" (customarily matched to tunes by Charles W. Dunbar or William B. Bradbury). While serving the South Street Methodist Episcopal Church in Utica, New York, Hartsough met publisher Joseph Hillman, a concurrence which was to have long-lasting effects even though Hartsough, for health reasons, had to request relocation to a drier climate. Hartsough transferred to the Utah Mission as its first superintendent and became presiding elder of the Wyoming District. In 1868, Hartsough, while in Wyoming but still in communication with Hillman, became musical editor of the Revivalist, a compendium of hymns and gospel songs which ultimately had 11 editions as items were removed or added. The Revivalist was published by Hillman in Troy, New York, with Hartsough and Hillman conducting most of their business through the mail. In 1871, Hartsough moved to a congregation in Epworth, Iowa. There, during a revival meeting, Hartsough finalized, and soon published in the Revivalist, the one gospel song (both words and tune being his) for which he is remembered because of its international popularity—“I Am Coming, Lord” (also known by its first line “I hear thy welcome voice”). In 1873 the song came to the attention of Ira D. Sankey as he sang for Dwight L. Moody during evangelistic campaigns in the United Kingdom, where it became known as \"Gwahoddiad\" from its translation into Welsh. According to hymnologist William Jensen Reynolds, Hartsough during his ministerial career served 15 congregations and five Methodist districts. He traveled some 400,000 miles while making 9,000 ministerial visits to members in need and participated in 7,000 prayer meetings and other church gatherings. Hartsough preached approximately 1,500 sermons. He spent the last years of his life in Mount Vernon, Iowa."

Vladimirsky graduated from Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography but decided to work as a book illustrator. He found it easiest to create evil characters, which are easily derived from the everyday life. Books illustrated by Vladimirsky were sold in 20 millions of copies. His illustrations to Tolstoy and Volkov were so popular in the Soviet Union that they were commonly reproduced on common goods including bottles of soft drinks and postcards."

Throughout his sporting career, Cikel trained full time for AC Wals Wrestling Club in Wals-Siezenheim, under his personal coach Max Aussenleitner. Being born in the former Czechoslovakia, Cikel also holds a dual citizenship with Slovakia to compete in numerous wrestling tournaments. Cikel qualified for his naturalized Austrian squad in the men's 60 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens by receiving a berth and placing ninth from the World Championships. He lost his opening match to South Korea's Jung Young-Ho in a tough, 4–5 sudden-death decision, but dismantled Uzbek wrestler, three-time Olympian, and 1999 world bronze medalist Damir Zakhartdinov into the ring with an astonishing 6–5 victory. Facing off against Japan's Kenji Inoue on his final bout, Cikel could not easily attack his opponent inside the mat, and lost the match with only nineteen seconds ahead of time because of the ten-point superiority limit. Finishing third in the prelim pool and eighth overall, Cikel's performance fell short to put him further into the quarterfinals."

  "text" : "Lawrence Dorr (1925– December 7, 2014) was the nom de plume of Janos Shoemyen, a Hungarian-American author. Born in Budapest, Hungary, he escaped his homeland during the Soviet occupation and subsequently endured an itinerant life in immediate post-war Europe, managing to emigrate, first to the UK and then the USA, finally settling in Gainesville, Florida. He was the author a of number of short story collections including A Slow Soft River, A Bearer of Divine Revelation, and A Slight Momentary Affliction, the latter receiving a nomination for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Three of his short stories appeared in the respected literary journal, The Virginia Quarterly Review. Dorr's work is best known for its highly literary, almost poetic quality, and the strong presence of faith and Christianity. In these works he frequently deals with the after-effects of World War II, both on his homeland and the individual. His later work is heavily influenced by the landscape of south and north Florida as it flashbacks to the horrors faced before his escape from occupied Budapest."

Crazy Water received the Mamdouha S. Bobst Prize for Emerging Fiction. Critical responses to Baker's work have been generous. Man Booker Prize-winning novelist John Banville wrote, \"The Glass Ocean is that rarest of things, a historical novel, or at least a novel set in history, that is also a work of art. Lori Baker is a captivating storyteller, and her prose has the flash and fire of molten glass.\" Other praise for the novel has come from Clare Clark, Bill Goldstein, and novelist Thomas Pynchon. According to WorldCat, the book is held in 706 libraries Along with her writing, Baker is part of the International Writers Project steering committee at Brown University., a project founded in 2003; each year, the IWP brings one visiting fellow to Brown for the academic year. The fellow is a prominent or emerging literary writer who has faced serious difficulties because of her or his writing (such as severe harassment, censorship, imprisonment, death threats). The project was founded by the novelist Robert Coover, and is currently overseen by Baker, Erik Ehn and Gale Nelson."

  "text" : "Loujaya Toni, born Loujaya Kousa in Lae c. 1966 and still going occasionally by that name, is a Papua New Guinean politician, poet and singer. Poems which she wrote as a schoolgirl were published by the Education Department, earning her a description as \"PNG's youngest poet\". In 1985, under the name Loujaya Dunar, \"she launched a string of solo gospel music albums\", beginning a career as a singer / songwriter. Most notably, she wrote the song \"Keep the Fire Alive\" and performed it with the group Tambaran Culture at the 1991 South Pacific Games in Port Moresby. A qualified journalist, she has also taught as a part-time tutor at the University of Technology in Lae. She stood unsuccessfully for election to the National Parliament in the 2007 general election. After a master's degree in communications in 2012, she stood again, in the general election that same year. Representing the Indigenous People's Party, she stood in the constituency of Lae, the capital of Morobe Province and the second largest city in the country, against the incumbent MP: her uncle Bart Philemon, veteran politician, outgoing Minister for Public Service, previously Minister for Finance and \"widely respected economic reformer\". She defeated him and won the seat, as one of the only three women elected to Parliament that year (with Delilah Gore and Julie Soso), out of 111 MPs. Despite being a first time MP, she was appointed Minister for Community Development, Religion and Family Affairs by Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, and joined his People's National Congress Party after the election. In December 2013, she controversially supported the actions of Parliament's Speaker Theo Zurenuoc, who had \"removed and badly damaged\" several carvings adorning the interior of Parliament and representing Papua New Guinea's diverse indigenous cultures. Zurenuoc considered the carvings to be contrary to Christianity. Toni, speaking up in support of the destruction, indicated it had been carried out on advice from an Israeli Christian evangelical movement, whom she had met. Stating that the carvings represented \"idol gods\", she added: \"The Government declares that the God of Israel is the God of PNG. […] I thank God for the Speaker Theodore Zurenuoc for the cleansing of the House\". Prime Minister O'Neill condemned the destruction, ordered it stopped, and publicly denied Toni's claim that it had been authorised by Cabinet: \"There is no truth in that. Cabinet didn’t give approval for anything to be removed from the National Parliament. The Minister has no authority to speak for Cabinet\". In August 2014, Toni resigned from the government to serve as interim chair of the Lae City Commission. She was replaced as Minister for Community Development by Delilah Gore."

Throughout her sporting career, Belisle trained full-time for the Burnaby Mountain Wrestling Club in Burnaby, British Columbia under her personal coach Mike Jones. Belisle made sporting headlines at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, where she captured a silver medal in the women's 48-kg division, losing to U.S. wrestler Patricia Miranda by a powerful pin. When women's wrestling made its debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Belisle qualified for the Canadian squad in the inaugural 48 kg class. Earlier in the process, she outclassed Mongolia's Tsogtbazaryn Enkhjargal to snatch both the trophy and ticket from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Madrid, Spain. She lost two straight matches each to Japan's Chiharu Icho on technical superiority, and Germany's Brigitte Wagner by a formidable 4–3 verdict, leaving her on the bottom of the prelim pool and placing eleventh in the final standings. At the 2006 World Wrestling Championships in Guangzhou, China, Belisle grappled her way at three kilograms heavier to pick up a silver medal in the final match against Japan's Hitomi Sakamoto in the 51-kg division."

  "text" : "Lee Na-lae (also Lee Na-rae, Korean: 이 나래; born January 1, 1979 in Incheon) is a retired amateur South Korean freestyle wrestler, who competed in the women's lightweight category. She produced a remarkable tally of five career medals, including a silver in the 55-kg division at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, and then finished seventh at the 2004 Summer Olympics, representing her nation South Korea. Lee also trained throughout her sporting career as a member of Incheon City Hall's wrestling club, under her personal coach Ahn Seung-mun. Lee highlighted her wrestling career when South Korea hosted the 2002 Asian Games in Busan. She picked up a silver medal in the inaugural women's 55 kg class, losing to her Japanese rival Saori Yoshida on technical superiority. She also boasted a bronze at the 2003 Asian Wrestling Championships in Delhi, India, but ended the same fate with another silver in a rematch against Yoshida by the following year, repeating their final in the process from the Asian Games. When women's wrestling made its debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Lee qualified for her South Korean squad in the 55 kg class. Earlier in the process, she captured a gold medal over Italy's Diletta Giampiccolo from the inaugural Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tunis, Tunisia, and placed second behind Yoshida at the Asian Championships in Tokyo, Japan to guarantee her spot on South Korea's Olympic wrestling team. In the prelim pool, Lee lost her opening match 2–5 to France's Anna Gomis, but rallied her campaign to pin and upset Greece's Sofia Poumpouridou in front of the home crowd inside Ano Liossia Olympic Hall. Despite missing a spot for the semifinals, Lee seized her opportunity to determine a fifth spot against China's Sun Dongmei, but fell short in their classification match with a close 3–4 decision. Lee initially placed eighth in the final standings, but later upgraded to seventh, as Puerto Rico's Mabel Fonseca was disqualified from the tournament after being tested positive for stanozolol."

She boasted a fourth-place finish in the 63-kg division at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, and later seized an opportunity to compete for Ukraine at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Holovchenko also trained throughout her sporting career as a member of the women's freestyle wrestling team for CSK Belaya Zerkov in Kiev, under her personal coach Serhiy Basitsi. When women's wrestling made its debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Holovchenko qualified for the Ukrainian squad in the 63 kg class. Earlier in the process, she earned an Olympic spot by finishing fourth from the World Championships. Holovchenko lost two straight matches each to eventual Olympic champion Saori Yoshida of Japan on technical superiority and neighboring Russia's Alena Kartashova with a comfortable 7–0 verdict, leaving her on the bottom of the pool and placing last out of twelve wrestlers in the final standings."

  "text" : "Liu Shaoqi (pronounced [li̯ǒu̯ ʂâu̯tɕʰǐ]; Chinese: 刘少奇; 24 November 1898 – 12 November 1969) was a Chinese revolutionary, statesman, and theorist. He was Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee from 1954 to 1959, Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China from 1956 to 1966 and President of the People's Republic of China, China's de jure head of state, from 1959 to 1968, during which he implemented policies of economic reconstruction in China. For 15 years, Liu was the third most powerful man in China, behind only Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. Originally groomed as the successor to Mao, Liu antagonized Mao in the early 1960s before the Cultural Revolution and was criticized, then purged, by Mao starting in 1966. Liu disappeared from public life in 1968 and was labelled the \"commander of China's bourgeoisie headquarters\", China's foremost 'capitalist-roader', and a traitor to the revolution. He died under harsh treatment in late 1969, but was posthumously rehabilitated by Deng Xiaoping's government in 1980 and granted a national memorial service."

  "text" : "Lidiya Karamchakova (Russian: Лидия Карамчакова; born February 17, 1968 in Abakan, Russian SFSR) is a retired amateur Tajik freestyle wrestler, who competed in the women's flyweight category. Karamchakova's wrestling career emerged with two career medals at the European Championships (1997 and 2000), before acquiring a dual citizenship to compete for Tajikistan in 2002. Since then, she scored a silver in the 48-kg division at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, and also finished seventh at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Karamchakova is also a member of the Viktor Wrestling Club in Krasnoyarsk, under her personal coach Viktor Raiko. Karamchakova reached sporting headlines at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, where she picked up a silver medal in the women's flyweight category (48 kg), being pinned by China's Zhong Xiue. When women's wrestling made its debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Karamchakova qualified for her naturalized Tajik squad in the inaugural 48 kg class. Earlier in the process, she placed third and guaranteed a spot on the Tajik wrestling team from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Madrid, Spain. Karamchakova lost her opening match to eventual Olympic champion Irini Merleni of Ukraine on technical superiority, but bounced back to upset Greece's Fani Psatha in front of the home audience with a 5–3 verdict, and then pinned Tunisia's Fadhila Louati before reaching the two-minute mark. Despite missing a spot for the semifinals, Karamchakova had a chance to compete against Russia's Lorisa Oorzhak, but she fell behind her fellow Russian rival by a rare 11–0 defeat, placing seventh in the final standings."

  "text" : "Leopold Lis-Kula (nom de guerre Lis) was a Colonel of Infantry of the Polish Army, and recipient of the Virtuti Militari. Lis Kula was born on November 11, 1896 in the village of Kosina near Łańcut (Austrian Galicia), and died on March 7, 1919 in the village of Torczyn near Lutsk, Volhynia, during the Polish–Ukrainian War. His father Tomasz Kula was a railway worker, while mother Elzbieta née Czajowska was a housewife. Leopold was their fourth child, and to provide better education for the children the family moved to Rzeszów in ca. 1910. Altogether, Tomasz and Elzbieta had eight children. Young Leopold, raised in a patriotic spirit by his mother, attended Austrian State Gymnasium II, which now is a high school named after him. He was an average student, who liked to cut classes: in spring 1911, on a day when Leopold decided not to go to school, he founded a secret youth organization, and soon afterwards, he joined boy scouts. In November 1911, Andrzej Małkowski, the father of Polish boy scouting in Galicia, came to Rzeszów. During a meeting with local teenagers, Leopold Kula took on a nickname \"Lis\" (\"Fox\"). By spring 1912, Kula was one of main members of patriotic youth organizations in Rzeszów. Together with other teens, he practiced military training in forests around Głogów Małopolski and Tyczyn. Some time in 1912, he left boy scouting and joined Riflemen's Association. In summer 1912, the association organized secret training camp near Jasło. Józef Piłsudski, who attended the event, personally talked with Lis-Kula, congratulating the young activist on his skills and enthusiasm. Recommended by Pilsudski, Kula was sent to Zakopane, where he completed summer officer school of the Riflemen's Association. In 1913, Leopold, who as 16 at that time was named deputy commandant of Rzeszów branch of the association. On August 5, 1914, together with a group of riflemen, Kula came to Kraków where he was named commandant of the 4th Company of a group of Mieczyslaw Trojanowski. In the fall of that year, Kula took part in the First Cadre Company's fighting against Russians in the area of Kielce. On October 9, 1914, he was promoted to the rank of Podporucznik (second lieutenant), by Józef Piłsudski and Kazimierz Sosnkowski. 18-year-old Leopold then fought in the battles of Krzywoploty and Łowczówek (November – December 1914). He was generally regarded as an excellent and courageous leader. In spring of 1915, together with 1st Brigade, Polish Legions, Lis crossed the Vistula river, moving eastwards, to Volhynia. In his spare time, Leopold studied French language and read works of Kant, Nietzsche and Spinoza. In January 1915, during a leave in Wadowice, he completed final high school exams. In 1917, after the so-called Oath crisis, Kula was interned, and then drafted into Austrian Army, which sent him to the Italian Front. Some time in 1918 Leopold returned to Galicia, and immediately busied himself with creation of Polish Army. He was of Pilsudski's favourite soldiers, and a very brave soldier. During the Polish–Ukrainian War, he fought both in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia, taking part among others in the Battle of Lemberg (1918). In the night of March 6/7, 1919, Kula carried out a successful attack on a Volhynian town of Torczyn, which had been in Ukrainian hands. On March 7 he died from wounds he had received during the night battle. Leopold Lis Kula was at that time regarded as one of the most gifted Polish officers. He was posthumously promoted to Colonel (Polkovnik), and his funeral, which took place in Rzeszów, turned into a patriotic demonstration. Kula was buried at Rzeszów's Pobitne Cemetery; among flowers placed on his coffin was a wreath that said \"To my brave boy – Józef Piłsudski\". Lis was posthumously awarded Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari and Cross of Independence (December 19, 1930). Several streets and buildings were named after him, as well as an armoured train Lis-Kula (named so on April 5, 1919). In 1937, Warsaw's 5th Men Gymnasium was named after him, and on March 8, 1939, Polish Minister of Internal Affairs named a settlement near Torczyn \"Kolonia Lisa-Kuli\". Also in 1939, Lis Kula was named patron of the 23rd Infantry Regiment from Wlodzimierz Wolynski. His monument is located in Rzeszów."

  "text" : "Leif Carlsen was a Danish football forward that represented the Danish Copenhagen side Frem in the Danish top league from 1964 to 1966. During the 1967 and 1968 seasons, he represented Hvidovre IF where he scored 6 goals. One of them was in the Danish Cup final, Carlsen scored the second goal in the 2-0 victory against Esbjerg fB Thereafter he moved across the Øresund to Swedish team Landskrona BoIS.After the 1970 season he became a celebrated hero for his new club. Landskrona BoIS had at the time been outside the finest Swedish football assembly, Allsvenskan for two entire decades. In 1968 their arch rivals Helsingborgs IF had been relegated down to Division 2 for the first time ever. And \"HIF\" failed to return to Allsvenskan in the 1969 season, due to a lost qualification. But by 1970 it was time for Landskrona BoIS instead. In August 1970 Leif Carlsen represented BoIS in the perhaps most important match ever played at Landskrona IP, primarily as the game most likely would decide which of the arch rival clubs that would win the regional Division 2 South league, Landskrona BoIS or Helsingborgs IF. Secondly for what later would become historic reasons. In front of 15.015 attenders Leif Carlsen scored the only goal. And now a qualification league for promotion to Allsvenskan awaited for Carlsen and his BoIS. This qualification league comprised four teams, the winners of the four regional Division 2 leagues. Apart from Landskrona BoIS, winner of the southern division 2 league, also Sandvikens IF (eastern), IFK Luleå (northern) and Skövde AIK (western) participated. Only two of the teams would be promoted. The rules stipulated one game should be played at home, one game away, and the last game would be played at neutral ground. BoIS started at home, and defeated Sandviken in front of 15.685 attenders, 2-0. The goals were scored by Sonny Johansson and Tommy \"Gyxa\" Gustafsson. Then followed a goalless draw in the very northern town Luleå andthe last and decisive qualification match was played at neutral ground, Nya Ullevi in Gothenburg. Landskrona BoIS that had missed qualifications in 1958, 1959, 1962 and 1968 now got nervous, as Skövde scored twice. However Sonny Johansson broke \"the spell\" and scored 1-2, followed by an equalizer from Leif Carlsen. So, Leif Carlsen contributed in the highest degree to both Hvidove's Danish cup gold in 1967/68 as well to the promotion of Swedish Landskrona BoIS to Allsvenskan in 1970 However non-Swedish citizens were at the time not allowed to play in the top Swedish league, hence Leif Carlsen couldn't represent Landskrona BoIS in 1971, much due to his own efforts for the club! While Landskrona BoIS made a rather successful return to Allsvenskan in 1971, their arch-rivals Helsingborg IF was yet again relegated down to Division 3 in 1971, and wouldn't play in Allsvenskan again for another 21 seasons. Leif Carlsens single decisive goal at Landskrona IP in September 1970, hence grew in importance by time and in retrospect."

  "text" : "Dr Leanne Armand (born February 1968) is a marine scientist and an expert in the identification of diatoms in the Southern Ocean. She is known for her contributions to the understanding of past Southern Ocean dynamics and sea ice as a result of her knowledge of diatom distributions and ecology. Her research focuses on the distribution of diatoms, a single-cell microscopic phytoplankton, within the Southern Ocean. Different species of diatoms inhabit different regions of the ocean, depending on the physical characteristics (e.g. temperature, salinity and nutrients) of the water mass. Understanding diatom distributions and how their skeletons are preserved in the fossil record contained within sediment cores taken from the ocean floor can provide information about past climate regimes, including ocean temperatures and sea ice extent. Armand has also recently studied diatoms in the Southern Ocean near Kerguelen and Heard Islands to examine their role in the transport of carbon to the ocean floor after their annual spring bloom."

  "text" : "Laurel Ptak is an artist, curator and educator based in New York City. A multidisciplinary figure inside the field of culture, she has made contributions across disciplines of photography, new media, social practice art, curating and technology. She was named one of 100 top Leading Global Thinkers by Foreign Policy magazine in 2014. She is currently a professor in the School of Art, Media and Technology at The New School. Her work often focuses on the social effects of technology and some of her recent projects have taken up topics including feminism, hacking, and social media. She is co-editor of the book Undoing Property? with artist Marysia Lewandowska. Its essays, interviews and artistic projects explore themes of immaterial labor, political economy and the commons and was published by Sternberg Press in 2013. Ptak's best known project, Wages For Facebook, draws upon ideas from the 1970s international Wages for housework feminist campaign to think through contemporary relationships of capitalism, class and affective labor inside social media. When it launched as a website it immediately drew over 20,000 views and was rapidly and internationally debated via social media and the press, setting off a public conversation about worker’s rights and the very nature of labor, as well as the politics of its refusal, in the digital age. Her work has been recognized with a research fellowship at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center; critical writing fellowship at Recess; travel and research grant from Foundation for Arts Initiatives; nomination for Independent Curators International’s Gerrit Lansing Independent Vision Curatorial Award and travel fellowship from Fundación Cisneros. She has been invited to lecture at numerous arts institutions internationally including Transmediale (Berlin), SALT (institution) (Istanbul), The Vera List Center for Art and Politics (New York), The Showroom (London), New Museum (New York), Casco—Office for Art, Design, Theory (Utrecht), The Photographers' Gallery (London), Kadist Art Foundation (San Francisco) and many others."

Only a few works have been attributed to him, but definitive attributions have been difficult due to the similarities between the artists of Guercino's workshop, including the similar styles of Benedetto Gennari and Cesare Gennari.

  "text" : "Lloyd C. \"Pat\" Landry joined the Central Intelligence Agency in the early 1950s following combat service in the US Army in World War Two. Sent to Laos in 1961, Landry became Deputy Chief of Operations under Bill Lair. Known as a strict disciplinarian, Landry was rarely without his British-style swagger stick, and he used to enjoy walking up behind someone and slapping it down on their desk. When the war in Laos escalated in 1968, command and control of SOG operations was split between the north-central theater centered on operations for control of the Plain of Jars and operations in the southern Laos Panhandle, aimed at controlling the Bolovens Plateau in order to maintain pressure on Vietnamese logistics along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The command center was relocated from Vientiane to Udorn Royal Thai Air Base in northern Thailand. Agency officials wanted Lair to remain in command at Udorn and for Landry to remain in Vientiane to command the southern operations group. Landry refused the promotion in order to remain Lair's deputy at Udorn. The move to Udorn made sense because that large base was capable of supporting an enormous Air Branch flight and maintenance program, as well as serving as the center of Agency theater photo-reconnaissance and photo-analysis efforts in support of SOG special operations in the Laos theater of operations. Udorn housed a large contingent of Air American platforms as well as US Air Force combat resources. In later years, Landry owned and operated several \"watering holes\" in Thailand, including the Cowboy Bar in Bangkok."

  "text" : "Laurie E. Weidberg (died 1986) was a socialist writer and speaker based in Manchester and London. Weidberg was raised in Manchester in petty-bourgeois Jewish family with strict religious ideas. In the 1930s, at the age of seventeen, he developed an interest in leftist politics. He attended a meeting of Stafford Cripps's Labour Party splinter group, but quickly became disillusioned with the speakers (including a young Barbara Castle) whom he judged to be motivated more by self-interest than genuine concern for the betterment of society. After about a year of perusing literature from various left-wing groups, he stumbled upon the Socialist Party of Great Britain's journal, The Socialist Standard, and was instantly convinced. Soon after, he joined the SPGB, and served as a regular writer for the Standard and as an outdoor speaker at Speakers' Corner and Lincoln's Inn. Weidberg had a reputation for being caustic, sharp-witted, and provocative, and he harboured a particular hatred for The Guardian. Besides dismissing the newspaper's overall tone as \"half-baked lefty crap\", he led an eleven-year campaign to challenge its report that snow had fallen during a Lord's cricket match on 2 June 1975. The complaint made it all the way to the Press Council, which eventually ruled in favour of the newspaper. This was not the first time Weidberg had made the news in connection with a complaint about Lord's: at a match earlier in the 1970s, he removed his shirt to enjoy the sunshine, and refused a steward's order to put it back on. He complained to the Marylebone Cricket Club, which ruled that Weidberg was free to go topless so long as he remained motionless. Laurie Weidberg died in 1986 after a long illness."

He is the current ratified world record holder in the masters M45 5000 metres. He has also held the M35 and M40 records and the M35 and M40 records at 10000 metres. He began running at age 15. He ran in the 1964, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, and 1972 International Cross Country Championships, then the 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1978 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, culminating with the championship. He also won the 1973 Corrida de Houilles. He had an example of longevity from his teammate on the early cross country teams as Olympic gold medalist Alain Mimoun was setting records into his 50's. Rault later surpassed some of Mimoun's records. He won his first French national Championship at 10000 metres in 1973, at the age of 37. In 1974 he won the national championship in cross country. He set his M40 10000m record before the 1976 Olympics in Rennes. Sixteen days later he exactly tied the record in Villeneuve-d'Ascq, both at 28:33.4."

In 2005, she founded the Global Leadership Scholarship Program, which grants North Korean students scholarships to learn English. In 2008, she became the first North Korean defector to run for a seat in the National Assembly. In 2009, Lee became the first female North Korean defector to earn a doctorate, which she earned from Ewha Womans University in the subject of food and nutrition. Also in 2009, she founded the Hana Defector Women's Organization, an NGO that gives North Korean women living in South Korea job training, childcare, educational support, and human rights training. As of 2012 she is in charge of the North Korean Traditional Food Institute, which gives vocational training to North Korean defectors and tries to bring North and South Korea closer by teaching about the food culture of Pyongyang. Also in 2012, Lee led an 18-day hunger strike in front of the Chinese embassy, against the repatriation of North Korean refugees held in China. She received a 2010 International Women of Courage award."

She has also advocated against acid attacks through gathering 27,000 signatures for a petition to curb acid sales, and taking that cause to the Indian Supreme Court. Her petition led the Supreme Court to order the central and state governments to regulate the sale of acid, and the Parliament to make prosecutions of acid attacks easier to pursue. She is the director of Chhanv Foundation, a NGO dedicated to help the survivors of acid attacks in India. Laxmi received a 2014 International Women of Courage award by US First Lady Michelle Obama.

  "text" : "Lydia Aleksandrovna Durnovo (Russian: Лидия Александровна Дурново; 1885 – 1963) was a Soviet Russian art historian and art restorer. She specialized in medieval art, especially in early Russian painting and Armenian illuminated manuscripts (miniatures) and frescoes. Born in the Russian city of Smolensk, Durnovo first attended a local gymnasium and a painting school before moving to Saint Petersburg where she attended the School of Technical Drawing of Baron Alexander von Stieglitz beginning in 1903. She subsequently completed her postgraduate studies at the State Institute of Art History (Государственный институт истории искусств) and the Archaeology Institute (ru) between 1920 and 1923. Durnovo worked as a research fellow at the Archaeology Institute, specializing in early Russian art. She was also the assistant curator of the Russian Museum. In October 1933 she was arrested for allegedly being an \"active member of a counterrevolutionary fascist organization.\" She was deported to Siberia and eventually freed three years later, in November 1936. Durnovo moved to the Armenian capital of Yerevan and became a member of the staff of the National Gallery of Armenia. Until 1951 she was devoted to the study of medieval Armenian frescoes and illuminated manuscripts. She specialized in medieval Armenian art, and by the mid-1950s Durnovo earned the reputation of an authoritative expert in the field. She supervised the restoration of the Etchmiadzin Cathedral's frescoes. She was rehabilitated by the Soviet government in 1956."

  "text" : "Larry Parker (April 1, 1922 – September 18, 1996) was a businessman from Alexandria, Louisiana, who served a single term from 1964 to 1968 in the Louisiana House of Representatives from Rapides Parish. His tenure corresponded with the first administration of Governor John McKeithen. Parker owned a coin shop and was president of the Alexandria Association, an organization of merchants. He was also a deputy for the Rapides Parish Sheriff's office and a radio news commentator. Parker and his wife, the former Sylvia Snyder (1936-2011), the daughter of Lewis Andrew Snyder and the former Eva Bland, had four children, Michael \"Mike\" L. Parker and wife Lesley, Kenneth \"Ken\" L. Parker and wife Susan, Dianna L. Dauzart & husband Gary, and Cathy L. Smith. Parker died at the age of seventy-four at the Alexandria Veterans Affairs Medical Center, located across the Red River in Pineville, Louisiana. Mrs. Parker died in Rogers, Arkansas, also at the age of seventy-four. Larry and Sylvia Parker are interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Ball north of Pineville in Rapides Parish. Former State Senator B. G. Dyess, a Southern Baptist pastor, officiated at Mrs. Snyder's funeral service on February 14, 2011. In 1966, Parker ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Louisiana's 8th congressional district, since disbanded. He lost to the one-term incumbent, Speedy Long of LaSalle Parish. In the spring of 1977, Parker ran for mayor of Alexandria in an all-Democratic contest in which Carroll E. Lanier unseated John K. Snyder."

While he and his wife, He Zhen were in exile in Japan he became a fervent nationalist. He then saw the doctrines of anarchism as offering a path to social revolution while remaining intent on preserving China's cultural essence, especially Taoism and the records of China's pre-imperial history. In 1909 he unexpectedly returned to China to work for the Manchu government and after 1911 supported Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor. After Yuan's death in 1916 he joined the faculty at Peking University. He died of tuberculosis in 1919."

  "text" : "Laura Cornelius Kellogg (\"Minnie\") (\"Wynnogene\") (1880–1947), was an Oneida leader, author, orator, activist and visionary. Kellogg, a descendent of distinguished Oneida leaders, was a founder of the Society of American Indians. Kellogg was an advocate for the renaissance and sovereignty of the Six Nations of the Iroquois, and fought for communal tribal lands, tribal autonomy and self-government. Popularly known as \"Indian Princess Wynnogene,\" Kellogg was the voice of the Oneidas and Haudenosaunee people in national and international forums. During the 1920s and 1930s, Kellogg and her husband, Orrin J. Kellogg, pursued land claims in New York on behalf of the Six Nations people. Kellogg's \"Lolomi Plan\" was a Progressive Era alternative to Bureau of Indian Affairs control emphasizing self-sufficiency, cooperative labor and organization, and capitalization of labor. According to historian Laurence Hauptman, \"Kellogg helped transform the modern Iroquois, not back into their ancient League, but into major actors, activists and litigants in the modern world of the 20th century Indian politics\"."

After the war he specialised in the treatment of endocrine disease and took a particular interest in congenital adrenal hyperplasia, leading him to devise a new technique for surgical removal of the adrenal gland. In the 1930s and 1940s Broster was among the first surgeons to operate routinely on intersex patients, in work that received frequent coverage in the British press and helped to establish Charing Cross Hospital as a centre for intersex and transgender medicine. His patients during this period included the Olympic athlete Mark Weston. Broster was a longtime member of the British Medical Association's Council and a chairman of the Commonwealth Medical Advisory Bureau's committee of management. With Raymond Greene, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Section of Endocrinology of the Royal Society of Medicine."

She went on to study at Cardiff Metropolitan University, where she competed in various throws events. She represented Jersey at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, coming fourteenth in the discus throw. Following that, she had her highest finish at national level, taking fourth place in the javelin at the British Athletics Championships. The repeated that finish the following year. The 2007 Island Games saw Therin take a gold medal sweep in the throws by coming first in the shot, discus and javelin events. She was also part of the Jersey women's 4×100 metres relay team. This was to be her final international athletics competition, however. Her personal best results were 47.25 metres in the discus throw, achieved in 2005; and 52.09 metres in the javelin throw, achieved in May 2007 in Bedford. She competed in bobsleigh and was a medallist for Great Britain at the FIBT World Championships 2008. She left the sport that same year and took part in UK Sport's Girls4Gold programme, which identified her talent for cycling. She established herself as a national level cyclist at the 2012 British National Team Sprint Championships, where she shared in the silver medal with teammate Eleanor Richardson. She began acting as a tandem pilot for visually-impaired Paralympian cyclists and she helped Aileen McGlynn to two bronze medals at the 2013 British National Track Championships. The following year she piloted Rhiannon Henry to a silver medal at the 2014 event. She and Henry teamed up again for the 2014 UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships."

As a member from Rapides Parish, Fuglaar served alongside W. George Bowdon, Jr., later the mayor of Alexandria, and T. C. Brister, the owner and operator of a hardware and sporting goods store in Pineville. Fuglaar was the second of ten children of Thomas Hall Fuglaar, Sr. (1862-1941), and the former Elodie Boyd Smith. His first wife, the former Hilda Johnson (1904-1930), died at the age of twenty-six. He had five children, Marjorie Elaine Dunbar, Lawrence T. Fuglaar, Jr., Thomas Eugene Fuglaar, Patricia Ann Fuglaar, and Leslie Lee Fuglaar. Representative Fulgaar's niece by marriage, Hilda J. Hathorn Fuglaar (1924-2001), was a daughter of another Louisiana state representative from Rapides Parish, Richmond C. Hathorn. Nearly eight years after his legislative service ended, Fuglaar ran unsuccessfully for the state House in the primary election held on December 5, 1959. One of the other losing candidates in that race was Nauman Scott of Alexandria, then a Democrat but later a Republican appointee to the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. In 1972, Fuglaar drowned when his boat capsized while he was fishing with his wife on Toledo Bend Reservoir near Hemphill in Sabine County in East Texas. Mrs. Fuglaar, full name not available, was able to summons for help and survived. Fuglaar is interred at Greenwood Memorial Park in Pineville."

Friedman was a member of a prominent landowning Jewish family from Natchez in southern Natchitoches Parish. His father, Samuel Friedman (1848-1888), died when Leon was barely a year old. This left his mother, Caroline S. Friedman (1847-1906), as head of the household. A brother, Harry, died in 1895 at the age of fourteen. An older brother, J. Isaac Friedman, served in the state House from 1908 to 1916 and in the Louisiana State Senate for an abbreviated term from 1922 to 1924, following the resignation of Charles Milton Cunningham, the editor and publisher of The Natchitoches Times. The Friedmans are interred at the Jewish Cemetery in Natchitoches. Leon and J. Isaac Friedman were not the first Jewish representatives from Natchitoches Parish. Earlier, Leopold Caspari, who in 1884 pushed successfully for the creation of Northwestern State University, also served in both houses of the legislature, nonconsecutively between 1884 and his death in 1915."

On 17 March 2014, Li was arrested by Beijing police due to drug possession. On 27 May 2014, the court found Li guilty, and sentenced him to nine months and fined him 2,000 Yuan. He was released from prison in December 2014, after serving seven months in prison, earlier than his original nine-month sentence, due to good behavior."

After the war, he worked as an airliner pilot for the Finnish flag carrier Aero O/Y. He was the pilot of the ill-fated Aero Flight 311 which crashed in Kvevlax in 1961. Hattinen and his co-pilot had presumably been drinking heavily the night before the flight."

  "text" : "Louis Jensen (born 19 July 1943) is a Danish author who is an innovator in the international literary trends of flash fiction, metafiction, prose poetry, and magical realism. While he has published more than 70 books for both adults and children, he is best known for his children's books, which include picture books, short stories, flash fiction, creative nonfiction and novels. His work is characterized by wordplay and playful experiments in form and structure, which have led critics to draw comparisons to Borges, Calvino, Gogol, and the poetry of the Oulipo movement. His work is also rooted in the fairy tale and folk tale tradition, and is deeply influenced by the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen. In 1992, Jensen embarked on his \"Square Story\" project, to write 1001 very short stories, each in the shape of a square. In 2016 he published his tenth volume of 100 stories, and an eleventh volume with a single, final story. This work in progress has been called \"one of the most radical literary projects in all of Danish literature,\" and the square stories have found an enthusiastic audience among adult readers as well as children. Jensen has received multiple awards and prizes. He has been nominated several times for both of the most prestigious international awards in children's literature, the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award and the Hans Christian Andersen Award. In 2010, he made the short list (5 authors, nominated from 34 countries) for the Hans Christian Andersen Award. In 2002, he was chosen by the Danish National Art Foundation to be included on the roster of 275 Danish artists who are awarded an annual stipend for their lifelong contributions to the arts and culture of Denmark. In 2014, he was nominated for the Nordic Council Children and Young People's Literature Prize for his eighth collection of square stories, published in 2012. The Nordic Council praised the \"humour and seriousness\" of Jensen's work, suggesting that his stories have \"brought greetings from Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis Carroll and E. T. A. Hoffman and other great poets to all the children and adults who just wanted to read along.\" In 2016, he again made the short list for the Hans Christian Andersen Award."

He is also the Dean of the School of Film/Video at CalArts since the summer of 2014. He is best known for his impressionistic technique in video imagery that creates a hypnotic effect as well as his use of sound design. The motif of water is dominant in his work and gave the name to the video series \"Memories of Water\". Pierce looks for inspiration in his immediate surroundings. He has stated that \"in the simplest terms, a film or a video can be considered to be a meaningful experience in time. As a filmmaker, I take that as my mission: through the use of image and sound, I am composing an experience for the audience\" He has won over 60 awards  from film and experimental festivals, grants such as the Rockefeller, Guggenheim and the National Endowment for the Arts, and has screened his films at the Museum of Modern Art, NY, the Sundance Film Festival, Rotterdam Film Festival, Cinémathèque française, and the Whitney Biennal."

  "text" : "Lem Winchester (March 19, 1928 - January 13, 1961) was an American jazz vibraphone player. Formerly a police officer, Winchester pursued music as a hobby in Wilmington, Delaware. He turned to music full-time after an appearance at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. He was soon working with some of the top names in jazz, making his debut recording with pianist Ramsey Lewis. Winchester recorded a handful of albums as a leader, and made sideman appearances with the likes of saxophonist Oliver Nelson, and organists Jack McDuff and Shirley Scott. Most of his recordings were with Prestige Records. Critic Scott Yanow has suggested that while Winchester's playing was strongly influenced by Milt Jackson, he \"did not stick around long enough to carve out his own original voice\" on the vibraphone. Winchester's career was cut short when he died in a handgun accident, aged 32."

  "text" : "Louis Sarecky was an American film producer and screenwriter at the very beginning of the sound era of motion pictures. Born in 1886 in Odessa in what was then the Russian Empire (today now part of Ukraine), he began his career in the last year of silent film, 1928, working on five films that year, four as screenwriter and one as producer. While he is only credited with working on 26 films, some of those were among the most popular films at that time: The Vagabond Lover (1929), Rudy Vallée's screen debut; The Cuckoos, starring the comedy team of Wheeler & Woolsey; and Friends and Lovers in 1931, starring Adolphe Menjou and Laurence Olivier. His crowning achievement would be the Academy Award-winning 1931 film Cimarron. Sarecky was the associate producer on the film, as well as helping adapt the screenplay, although he was uncredited for the latter. Since the film won the Oscar for both outstanding production and best adapted screenplay, he would have the dubious distinction of contributing in both those fields, yet not receiving an Academy Award himself (William LeBaron would receive the Outstanding Production Oscar, while Howard Estabrook would get the writing statue). Sarecky was the brother to the more well-known writer and producer, Barney Sarecky. Louis would die in Los Angeles California in 1946."

Deas is a native of Newport News, Virginia, near Norfolk, where she was a student at Eastern Virginia Medical School when she suffered a bad automobile accident in 1980. Already an avid bridge player, she played \"all the time\" when broken bones and blurry vision forced her to take one-year leave from school, and subsequently decided to drop out in favor of the card game as a career. At one time Deas ranked first among Women World Grand Masters. At one time she was on the road as a professional player for 30 weeks a year. She was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy in 1997 and reduced her travel. As of January 2012, she lived in Schenectady, New York. Online she advertises teaching and coaching services, as well as playing. At the inaugural SportAccord World Mind Games in Beijing, December 2011, Deas and Beth Palmer won the \"Pairs Women\" gold medal. Not a world championship meet, the SportAccord WMG invited 24 women from Great Britain, France, China, and the U.S. to compete in three small tournaments as four national teams, twelve pairs, and 24 individuals. The six U.S. women also won the Teams gold medal. Beside the two gold medals Deas won $8000 in cash prizes."

Vetter was also a secretary-treasurer and then the president of the Red River Parish Fair Association, in which capacity he obtained a grant for a needed new exhibition barn. Vetter died in a New Orleans hospital shortly before the end of his legislative term. He was survived by his widow, the former Anna May Posey (1912-2004), a teacher and businesswoman and one of three children of George J. Posey. The Vetters had two children, a son and a daughter.

  "text" : "Wesley \"Lee\" Behel was an American aviator and air racing champion. He was the creator and, at the time of his death the president, of the \"Sport Class\" a group of racing airplanes designed for planes under 1000 cubic inches in size that participate in the Reno Air Races each year in September, as well as a retired Lt. Colonel in the Nevada Air National Guard. Behel joined the Nevada Air National Guard in 1972, where he flew several aircraft, including the F-101 Voodoo, the F4 Phantom in which he accumulated 2,500 hours of flight time, as well as the RF-4C reconnaissance aircraft. He retired from the Guard in 1996. In 2000, he first flew in the AirVenture Cup Race, a cross-country open-circuit air race, with his ten-year-old son Jay on board. He would fly that race fifteen straight years. On 8 September 2014, Behel perished while flying Sweet Dreams, a custom built one of a kind aircraft that was powered by a Chevrolet small-block engine that had been adapted for use in this specific aircraft. The crash took place in the north end of the race course when the plane Behel was flying suffered a \"catastrophic mechanical failure\" at 3:16 p.m. According to witnesses, the aircraft took off and flew to enter the course. Around the 5th outer pylon, in an area of the course known as \"High-G Ridge\", sections of the right wing broke away from the airplane, which then rolled sharply to the right and impacted the ground. The aircraft was estimated to be traveling nearly 400 miles per hour (640 km/h) and was no more than 100 feet (30 m) off the ground when the failure occurred. The crash occurred during a qualifying heat early in the 2014 Reno Air Race program and will be investigated by the NTSB as well as the FAA. Behel was a certified fighter jet pilot who also enjoyed flying single-engine stunt planes. Behel had once owned Steven's Creek Porshe/Audi in Santa Clara, a business that he had sold in 2012. In April 2014, Behel had set 3 class world records in the same aircraft: Speed over a 3 km course, 3 km time-to-climb, and speed over a 15 km course. Additionally, at the time of his death he held the world speed records for the RF-4C in 100 and 500 km closed courses."
