  "text" : "Marisa Isabel dos Santos Matias (born February 20, 1976 in Coimbra) is a Portuguese sociologist with work in the area of environment and public health, and European MEP of the Left Bloc. Marisa Matias studies Sociology at the University of Coimbra with the thesis: “Is nature sick of us? Health, environment and emerging forms of citizenship.” (2009); MA in Sociology, social studies in Science and Technology and BA in Sociology by the same university. She has published several scientific articles, chapters in books and other publications, national and international, on the relations between environment and public health, science and knowledge, democracy and citizenship. Collaborated as a training/teacher in various training courses and postgraduate programs (including master and phd programs). Conducted scientific research in the areas of environmental health, sociology of science, sociology of health and political sociology. Research member of the Centre for Social Studies of University of Coimbra (since 2004); research assistant of the Centre for Social Studies of University of Coimbra, Portugal (2000–2004); teacher of Sociology and other disciplines in ITAP and Profitecla schools (2000–2001); secretary of newsroom of the Scientific Magazine of Social Sciences (1998–2000). Member of Left Bloc National Board and Executive Board; member of board of Pro-Urbe, a civic association in Coimbra. She was national trustee of the movement \"Cidadania e Responsabilidade pelo Sim\", during the campaign for decriminalization of abortion in Portugal. Activist in the movement against co-incineration in Souselas and head of the Left Bloc list in the elections for Coimbra Municipality (2005). In 2009 was elected MEP being part of the political group GUE/NGL. In the European Parliament she is member of the Industry, Research and Energy Committee and Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee. Also member of the delegation to the relations with the Mashriq Countries, with the Legislative Council of Palestine and with South Africa. At the beginning of mandate was nominated the Parliament’s rapporteur to write and negotiate the directive preventing the entrance of false medicines into legal distribution. A business that generates more than €400 billion per year for the counterfeiting networks and puts at risk the life of patients. The proposed directive, and negotiated for almost two years, with the parliamentary groups and the governments, would be approved in 2011. Marisa Matias was the second time since Portugal’s entrance at the EU a Portuguese MEP, which leaded the process of a framework-directive, a law that will be transposed to the judicial system of each of the 28 member States until 2016. At the same time, she was also rapporteur of the European strategy in the fight against Alzheimer and other dementias, that would equally be approved in 2011. She was part, and co-president, of the European Work Group for Diabetes, being co-author of the first resolution to ever be approved in the European Parliament aiming at the definition of a political strategy to fight the diabetes epidemic (2010). Was also involved in the planning and approval of proposals of resolution on cancer, HIV, and was active member of the parliamentary committee inquiry on the case of H1N1 vaccine. In 2011 was elected by its pairs, with more than 350 votes, was MEP of the Year for health, being the single MEP from the United Left Parliamentary Group to receive this price since its creation. In the years 2011 and 2012 was the Parliament’s rapporteur for the definition of a Common Strategic Framework for Research and Innovation. The report was approved in 2012 and established the bases for what should be the proposal for the Horizon 2020 programme on the European financing of research and innovation for the period 2014–2020. Besides the proposal to reinforce the funds and of a better geographical distribution of the funds, the approved proposal also included a significant increase of support to the scientific work and to the attribution of scholarships within the European financing framework. Later, would also be part of the team of six rapporteurs, nominated by the European Parliament, to the definition and negotiation of the proposal about the Horizon 2020, being responsible for one of the legislative regulations on the Strategic Agenda for Innovation. The legislative package would end up being approved at the end of 2013, being already active since January 2014. In 2012 she was still nominated rapporteur of the European Parliament for the evaluation of the European Central Bank (ECB) activities of 2011, the year the ECB presidency changed. In a very disputed process and hard negotiations, her report would be approved by one vote of difference in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. Later, the report would be approved, in plenary, still in 2013, but Marisa Matias requested her name to be withdraw as a result of approved changes in the final vote. Those changed took out of the report all the critical references to the ECB as member of the European Troika, equally eliminating the proposal to oblige the ECB to restore to the countries under the Troika’s intervention the profits resulting from the complex processes of buying and selling of public debt titles. Marisa Matias was, still, the Parliament’s rapporteur for four opinion on European strategy for adapting to climate change, resettling of GDP calculation, proposal for a new pluri-annual financing framework and regulation defining indexes on the goods traded in stock market. As shadow rapporteur, meaning, MEP responsible within its parliamentary group, to follow and negotiate proposals led by other colleagues from other parliamentary groups, Marisa Matias followed, during the mandate, the making of 25 parliamentary proposals, having presented proposals for change and being present in negotiation meetings. So far, was also co-author of 119 proposals of parliamentary resolutions. While Vice-President of the Parliament to the relations with the Mashriq countries (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt) was part and presided to several parliamentary negotiations with these countries, coordinating processes of negotiation with the correspondent national parliaments. This was also done during the period known for the transformations introduced by the Arab Spring. Marisa is also member of the Parliament’s Delegation to the relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, having developed initiatives mainly concerning the siege of the Gaza Strip. On Oct. 18, 2015, Catarina Martins, co-ordinator of the Left Bloc, announced that, as no credible unifying leftist candidate had so far appeared for the Presidential elections of January 2016, Marisa Matias allowed her name to be put forward as representing her party in those elections."

His first works in the Swedish ballad tradition was works of Carl Michael Bellman, Sweden's unofficial national poet, who is sometimes considered the starting point of the Swedish ballad tradition. Best recorded three albums with Bellman's songs, mainly from the song collections Fredman's Epistles in translations by Paul Britten Austin, with some additions from Fredman's Songs as well as other Bellman works: To Carl Michael with Love (1975), Bellman in Britain (1978), and Songs of Carl Michael Bellman. Songs from the two first albums were later collected on a CD, also named To Carl Michael with Love. Other Swedish song poets performed by Best include Birger Sjöberg (1885–1929), with one album released in 1979."

  "text" : "Mollie Geraldine Dyer (1927–1998) was a Yorta Yorta woman who was an Aboriginal Child Welfare Worker and Aboriginal community worker, best known for co-founding the Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency in 1977. Auntie Mollie, as she became known, was the daughter of Margaret Tucker, an Aboriginal activist involved in establishing Australian Aborigines League, and Philip Tucker, an Irish man. Dyer grew up in Hawthorn and Hastings. Dyer was educated at a convent school in Abbotsford where she was the only Aboriginal pupil. She would frequently travel to New South Wales to stay with her mother's family at Cummeragunja Mission. When Dyer's father was serving overseas during World War II, Dyer, aged 15, left school to enter the workforce, where she experienced significant racism. Dyer's first marriage, to Alan Burns in 1947, produced six children all of whom were to become involved in Aboriginal community work and activism, and then married Charlie Dyer. In addition to her six biological children, Dyer would foster 19 children and provide short term accommodation for many more throughout her life. In the 1960s and 1970s, Dyer worked with a group of fellow Aboriginal women to establish and deliver services to the Aboriginal community despite a lack of funding. In 1966, Dyer accepted a full-time position with the Aborigines Advancement League, continuing and formalising her welfare work. When the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service was established in 1973, Dyer moved to a position there. In 1976, Dyer delivered a speech at a national adoption conference and this instigated discussion of an Aboriginal-run agency to support Aboriginal children and families. The Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency was established and Dyer served as Program Director, and soon similar organisations were established in other parts of Australia. Dyer worked to establish the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (SNAICC) in 1981. Dyer was part of the group that establish the Brambuk Living Cultural Centre in Halls Gap. Dyer received the Member of the Order of Australia medal in 1979 in recognition of service to the Aboriginal community. She also received an International Year of the Child Award and an Advance Australia Medal. The Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency headquarters was named in her honour. A street in the ACT suburb of Bonner is named after her."

  "text" : "Matt Apuzzo is an American journalist. He won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting in 2012. In 2013, Apuzzo co-wrote a book with Adam Goldman called Enemies Within. Apuzzo was born in Cumberland, Maine and attended Colby College. He wrote for the Waterville Morning Sentinel while in college. He then worked for The Standard-Times in New Bedford, Massachusetts before moving to the Associated Press. He reported on New York City Police Department corruption and misconduct and revealed its collaboration with the CIA to conduct surveillance in Muslim communities. He won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting with Adam Goldman, Eileen Sullivan and Chris Hawley. In 2013, it was revealed that the Justice Department secretly subpoenaed his phone records as part of leak investigation into who provided the Associated Press information about a bomb plot foiled by the CIA. It was later revealed that the Justice Department had conducted leak investigations into his stories twice before. He has been highly critical of government secrecy and the media's willingness to accept it. Since 2013, he has worked for The New York Times. In 2015, a New York Times front page story by Matt Apuzzo and Michael S. Schmidt about the Hillary Clinton email controversy drew criticism for inaccuracies. Apuzzo and Schmidt had reported that inspectors general had filed a criminal referral to the Justice Department on Clinton over her handling of classified information. Kevin Drum wrote, \"virtually everything about the story turned out to be wrong.\" Though the FBI did open an investigation, the referral was a \"security referral.\"  It turned out there was a criminal investigation into the emails, according to The Washington Post. The newspaper reported that Justice Department granted immunity to the man who set up the server for Clinton. In fact, FBI Director James B. Comey would later say in a May 2016 interview with reporters that Clinton's description of the FBI probe had left him baffled: \"I don't even know what that means. I'm not familiar with the term security inquiry.\" He added: “We’re conducting an investigation. That’s the bureau’s business. That’s what we do. . . . It’s in our name.” In December 2015, another New York Times story by Apuzzo and Schmidt (written together with Julia Preston) criticized the US government for missing crucial evidence during the visa vetting process for a woman who would later become one of the shooters in the San Bernardino attack. The director of the FBI dismissed the reporting as \"garble\" and it turned out that rather than having \"talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad\" as stated in the New York Times article, the woman had mentioned these in private communications. The public editor of the New York Times called for \"systemic changes\" after these two erroneous articles by Apuzzo and his coauthors, which both relied on anonymous government sources. These problems were described as a \"red alert\" highlighting the need for more diligent and skeptical reporting and editing."

Marguerite Lundgren was born to a Swedish father and English mother and during her childhood lived both in Sweden and England, being fluent in both languages. Through an aunt, who was one of the founders of the Wynstones School in Gloucestershire, she was able to attend the  Michael Hall school, then in South London. This stimulated her interest in Eurythmy, which she went on to study with Lieselotte Mann in England. In 1946, after completing her training, she joined the stage group at the. Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland, where her originality and talent were quickly spotted by the troupe leader, Marie Savitch. This led to a lifelong bond and common research between the two women. In 1948, she was asked to return to England to take over the Eurythmy school of Vera und Judy Compton-Burnett, where she came to know and work closely with Owen Barfield and Cecil Harwood, whom she married in 1953. Their cooperation led to her fundamental research in creating a Eurythmic form specifically for the English language. For many years she taught and performed with the London School of Eurythmy, which she directed, and the London Stage Group. The work took her regularly to Scandinavia, North America and South Africa, where she did much to assist the development of Eurythmy. The last years of her life brought with them the death of her husband, Cecil Harwood, from which she never quite recovered, and the move of her Eurythmy school from London to East Grinstead in Sussex, close to where they had lived for many years. She died in August 1983. The book Eurythmy and the Impulse of Dance written together with Cecil Harwood and Marjorie Raffé, records her research into the principles of Eurythmy in English."

  "text" : "Mervyn Patrick Wingfield, 9th Viscount Powerscourt (22 August 1905 – 1973) was an Irish peer. He was son of Mervyn Wingfield, 8th Viscount Powerscourt and Sybil Pleydell-Bouverie. He married Sheila Claude Beddington on 16 December 1932 in Jerusalem and They had three children, a daughter and two sons, Grania Langrishe, the heir Mervyn and Guy Wingfield. The second world war had a huge impact on the family. Viscount Powerscourt served in the war and was captured by the Germans in Italy. When he came home his health had been compromised and he suffered from shell shock. Lady Powerscourt had taken the family to Bermuda. They returned home when he did. He came into his inheritance of the Powerscourt Estate in 1947. His marriage never recovered from the impact of the war. In 1963 his wife left and as a result of the financial impact the family sold Powerscourt Estate. He was appointed the first Chief Scout of the Boy Scouts of Ireland (BSI) in 1949."

  "text" : "Maria Skytte af Duderhof (died 1703) was a Swedish Baroness and Countess known for her unconventional life style. She was the offspring of Baron Bengt Skytte and Christina Sparre and the niece of Vendela Skytte: Gustav Skytte and Christina Anna Skytte were her cousins. She was born sometime between 1636 and 1639. In 1664, she entered a long term relationship with riksråd Count Gustaf Adam Banér (1631-1681), the same year Banér married Katarina Lillie (1643-1667). Skytte lived openly with Banér, which was formally a crime and caused a national scandal which made them both infamous. When she accompanied him openly during his journeys around the country, they were publicly trialed. Maria Skytte was accused of having disguised herself as a male when she visited him in secrecy. which was also a crime at the time. This has attracted attention in gender studies, and Maria Skytte as well as Greta Benzelia has been regarded as an example of females posing as males when wishing to hide their identity. Banér was forced to swear before the court hovrätten that he had not consummated his relationship with Skytte sexually, after which he was warned and exiled from the royal court. After Banér was widowed in 1667 Skytte married him: the marriage was first declared non valid and Banér was declared exiled from the country for six years, but the couple managed to have it legalized. Maria Skytte was portrayed in the novel Fribytaren på Östersjön by Viktor Rydberg."

His purpose, as a representative of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, was to convert Americans to Islam and clear general misconceptions about it. Something that separated Mutfi Muhammad Sadiq from his contemporaries was the belief in Racial integration between all racial and ethnic groups not just African Americans. A large number of Islamic oriented organizations sprang up among African Americans in the 1920s and 30's such as the Nation of Islam were influenced by Mufti Muhammad Sadiq's teachings and turned toward his understanding of Islamic concepts. He was also important in trying to unite a hodgepodge of Muslim immigrants from Arabs to Bosnians to build mosques and have congregational prayer especially in Detroit and Chicago. Mufti Muhammad Sadiq entered the US without any financial resources, and embarked upon spreading the message of Islam in an area that was completely alien to his native culture. Consequently, he faced many difficulties, trials, and tribulations due to his skin color and religion. Mufti Muhammad Sadiq also managed to establish the Moslem Sunrise the longest running Muslim publication in America as well as writing many articles on Islam in various American periodicals and newspapers"

  "text" : "Mayra Alejandra [my'rah / aleh-han'-drah] (May 7, 1955 – April 17, 2014) was a Venezuelan television and film actress. Born as Mayra Alejandra Rodríguez Lezama, she was raised in a home of artists and was for sure bound to have some of the same passions. Her father, Charles Barry (born Carlos Rodríguez), was a humourist and founding member of the long standing Radio Rochela comedy show, while her mother, Ligia Lezama, was a teleplay writer and although an able actress. Besides, Mayra's family included her brother Juan Carlos Barry, a humourist like his father, and their uncle Miguel Ángel Barry, a lyric tenor. For most of her career, a Mayra character coped with the unfortunate turn of events that were inevitable in TV melodramas and movies by conveying a tense or worried expression. Her fits of tears or temperament were short and sweet, and it underscored the projected inner strength of her characters that proved a pictorial sense of feminism. Her technique was spontaneous and effective, but her acting genius and rhetoric relied on her expressive eyes and the graceful stylings of her hands. After attending high school, Mayra made her debut in the Radio Caracas Television telenovela Valentina (1975). Then, her first starring role was in Angélica (1976), where she played a character created especially designed for her by her mother Ligia Lezama. Later, the young actress excelled in La hija de Juana Crespo (1977), an effective drama from Salvador Garmendia and José Ignacio Cabrujas. Mayra next appeared in another hit, Luisana Mia (1981), but she is best remembered for her strong performance in Leonela (1983), where she played the role of a rape victim falling in love with her rapist. She also appeared in sympathetic parts in Bienvenida Esperanza (1983), Marta y Javier (1983) and La Mujer Prohibida (1991). Nevertheless, Mayra only needed two films to create a perennial image of femme fatale inside Venezuelan cinema. In 1978 she portrayed the ill-fated Carmen of Prosper Mérimée, as sensual as unprejudiced, dragged itself to tragedy, in Román Chalbaud's adaptation Carmen la que contaba 16 años. Eight years later she repeated her success as a troubled woman, but perhaps more fragile, more lover and friendly that Carmen, while characterizing the seductive and promiscuous Manon Lescaut of Abbé Prévost. In Manón, a reasonably faithful adaptation made by Chalbaud, Mayra projected an unforced dignity that bolstered her image and established herself as a reliable actress. Eventually, she appeared in a bunch of TV series and stage. In contrast to her controversial characters, Mayra lived a quiet life and was devoted to God and family values, but never thought of herself as a sex symbol. In the 1990s, she took this time at the height of her popularity to go on sabbatical to take care of her child. Motherhood was part of her public image, and her own children frequently was featured in fan magazine articles and photographs. Still beautiful at 45, Mayra went back to work in 2000, appearing as a guest star in the Venevisión telenovela Hechizo de Amor. In her later collaborations, she had become typed as a mother, usually playing the parent of grown-up children, appearing as characters that were older than herself, thus acquiring an older image that belied her actual age. Adapting to her new support role, she made significant appearances in Estrambótica Anastasia (2004) and Harina de otro costal (2010), a contemporary and correct version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. During her career, Mayra starred alongside leading men as Miguelángel Landa, both in television and films, as well as with Carlos Olivier, José Luis Rodríguez and Jean Carlo Simancas. Twice married and divorced, she was the mother of Aaron Salvador Pineda, born from her relationship with Mexican actor Salvador Pineda. In 2012, Mayra Alejandra announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer. She subsequently received chemotherapy treatment, being able to regain a level of normalcy in her life. She suffered a relapse in early 2014, and died in Caracas on April 17 at the age of 58."

  "text" : "Michael Fitzpatrick (born 1950) is a British general practitioner (GP) and medical author from London, UK. Fitzpatrick is known for writing several books and newspaper articles about controversies in autism, from his perspective as someone who is both a GP and the parent of a son with autism. His book Defeating Autism: A Dangerous Delusion (2008) describes his views on the rising popularity of \"biomedical\" treatments for autism, as well as the MMR vaccine controversy. Fitzpatrick's books have also focused on the pseudoscientific treatments for autism, such as Mark Geier's use of chelation therapy and Lupron as autism treatments, which Fitzpatrick has criticized as \"dehumanising and dangerous.\" He also condemned the use of secretin as an autism treatment in his 2004 book MMR and Autism: What Parents Need to Know, in which he wrote that \"the secretin bubble burst\" when a randomized controlled trial found that it was ineffective. In an interview with The Guardian, he proposed that special diets are appealing to parents of children with autism because so little is known about the cause or possible treatments for autism, \"And then someone else comes along and says your doctor's useless, that they know what caused it, and that you can do something about it\"."

Malka married her first-cousin, Rabbi Sholom Rokeach, son of Rabbi Elazar Rokeach and Rebbetzin Rivka Henna Ramraz, her father's sister. They had five sons and two daughters. Rabbi Sholom considered Malka as his partner in his Torah study and in all of his spiritual endeavors. He said that when he took it upon himself to remain awake one thousand nights to study Torah, Malka stood at his side to ensure that his candle remains lit so that he shouldn't have to interrupt his Torah study. Malka died in September 1853 (8 Elul, 5613 A.M.) and was buried in Belz. Each year on the day of her yahrzeit, 8 Elul, Belzer Hasidim continue to light candles in her memory. The girls' schools of the Belzer Hasidim are named in her honor. Her brother was the father-in-law of Rabbi Yechezkel Shraga Halberstam, in the latter's fourth marriage."

In 1988 he wrote the script for the comedy musical Quasimodo with music by Richard Rowland.Between 1971 and 1974 he recorded songs at Richard Branson's Manor Studio and these were issued in 1974 on an LP, titled \"Max\", on Virgin's budget Caroline label imprint. A single, \"Stephanie\" (B-side \"All I Know\"), was taken from the LP and released on the Virgin label proper (as was normal for those Caroline artists that got to release singles). The album and single were credited to \"Max\" with the surname dropped. The Virgin label connection came about because Handley had been on the production team for Richard Branson's \"Student\" magazine."

  "text" : "Maher Abd Al-Hafiz Hajjar (born 1968) is a Syrian politician, MP for Aleppo for the opposition People's Will Party and a candidate for the Syrian presidential election, 2014. Hajjar was born in Aleppo in 1968 into a prominent Sunni Muslim family of religious teachers. He graduated from Aleppo University with a diploma in Linguistic Studies. He joined the Syrian Communist Party in 1984 and when the party split in 2000 he joined Qadri Jamil's newly formed People's Will Party. He formed the party's branch in the city of Aleppo and became secretary of the party's council. He stood as an independent in the 2007 parliamentary election but failed to get elected. He stood again in the 2012 parliamentary election. This election took place during the Syrian Civil War after the Constitution of Syria had been amended to remove reference to the leadership of the Ba'ath Party. He was elected to the People's Council of Syria as one of only 5 of 250 MPs that were not part of the ruling National Progressive Front. He was nominated as one of only three candidates for the Syrian presidential election, 2014 running against President Bashar al-Assad. The armed opposition described it as just an attempt \"to give legitimacy\" to the election and that Hajjar had been persuaded to stand by the Syrian security services. Given that the Constitution of Syria requires at least 35 MPs to nominate a presidential candidate, nearly all of his nominations must have come from either independents or MPs from the ruling National Progressive Front. After his nomination, the People's Will Party distanced themselves party from Hajjar, claiming that Hajjar was no longer a member of either the party or the Popular Front for Liberation and Change and that \"Hajjar represented only himself\"."

Muhammad also had a brother named Shah ibn Mikal, who, during his early career, along with Muhammad, played an important role under the Tahirid ruler Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani. In 864, the Alid Hasan ibn Zayd conquered Tabaristan from the Tahirids, while another Alid named Muhammad ibn Ja'far ibn al-Hasan expelled the Tahirid governor of Ray, and captured the city. The Tahirid ruler Muhammad ibn Tahir shortly sent an army from Khurasan under Muhammad ibn Mikal, who managed to recapture the city and capture Muhammad ibn Ja'far. Hasan, however, quickly made a counter-attack under his Dailamite general Wajin, who managed to rout the army of Muhammad ibn Mikal, and kill the latter. Muhammad had a son named Abd-Allah Mikali, who achieved prominence under the Saffarids, a dynasty which had conquered Khurasan from the Tahirids."

Dudoit founded the literary journal 'Oiwi: A Native Hawaiian Journal in 1999 and served as its first editor. According to her successor, Ku'ualoha Ho'omanawanui, \"Mahealani knew how difficult it was for Hawaiian writers to get published in other venues for various reasons. Oiwi was created as a place where Hawaiian literary voices could be heard, nurtured, appreciated.\" She received the Ernest Hemingway Memorial Award for Poetry in 1989, the Elliot Cades Award for Literature in 1999, and a John Dominis Holt Fellowship in 2002. Dudoit was found dead in a Kaneohe hotel on August 28, 2002, along with her husband Sanford Kapana. The Honolulu police department ruled her death a suicide. This conclusion was disputed by the medical examiner's office, citing inconclusive autopsy results, a lack of motive, and a restraining order that she had filed against her husband."

  "text" : "Mukesh Chhabra is a Mumbai-based casting director, acting workshop director and actor who has cast several actors for movies including director Vikas Bahl's Chillar Party, Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur, Abhishek Kapoor's Kai Po Che and Nikhil Advani's D-Day. Chhabra graduated from Delhi University with an acting diploma from the Shri Ram Centre for Performing Arts. He completed a six-year acting and teaching stint with the ‘Theatre in Education’ Company (TIE) affiliated with the National School of Drama.(NSD) Chhabra came to Mumbai in 2007 and worked as an Assistant Casting Director before setting up his own casting company. His first film as independent casting director was the small budget film Chintuji. His casting for the film Chillar Party won him accolades based on which director Anurag Kashyap engaged him for the casting of his crime thriller Gangs of Wasseypur and also its sequel. Subsequently, Chhabra did the casting for films of different genres like Kai Po Che, Shahid, Chennai Express, Jai Ho, Hasee To Phasee, Mastram and D-day Apart from films, he's also done casting for TVCs. In his career, Chhabra has employed several unconventional casting methods. For example, he spotted the budding actor Irfan Khan, who played the character 'Fatka' in the film Chillar Party, on the streets of Mumbai. Chhabra's democratic style of auditioning has previously invited nuisance value from potential actors. Actor Rajkumar Yadav (now Rajkumar Rao) was chosen to play one of the leads for the film Kai Po Che only on Chhabra's insistence. Rao's talent in the film won him critical acclaim and later Chhabra cast him in Shahid as the leading man. Two of Chhabra's films, due to be released this year, are Anurag Kashyap's Bombay Velvet starring Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma and Rajkumar Hirani's P.K starring Aamir Khan."

Although her work has appeared in a number of publications, she had a long affiliation with The Washington Post newspaper. She was hired in 1968 by Post executive editor Ben Bradlee to write for the paper's Style section, and remained with the Post for over two decades until 1991. While there, she profiled the Watergate criminals and wrote a series on Vietnam veterans that led to her 1984 book Long Time Passing: Vietnam and the Haunted Generation. It was the first trade book to examine post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and, according to Vietnam expert Arnold R. Isaacs, one of the first to \"break the long national silence\" about the war. Her 2006 biography of I.F. Stone, All Governments Lie! The Life and Times of Rebel Journalist I. F. Stone, won the 2007 Ann M. Sperber Award for media biography, and was a finalist for a 2008 PEN Center USA literary award."

  "text" : "Margaret Stevenson Miller (1896 – 1979) was a British lecturer and researcher, who campaigned for women's rights. After studying at the University of Edinburgh, she gained her PhD at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (now part of University College London). Margaret learned Russian, and visited and corresponded with Beatrice Webb. Margaret joined the Department of Commerce at the University of Liverpool in 1928 and married a colleague, C Douglas Campbell in 1932, author of British Railways in Boom and Bust.Although British universities did employ married women,  on the recommendation of the Vice Chancellor, Dr H J W Hetherington, the University of Liverpool Council exceptionally introduced a marriage bar in February 1933 that forced her to resign. The resulting protest was taken up by other groups campaigning for equality for women, including the feminist Six Point Group, The British Federation of University Women which led to the Campaign of Right for the Married Women to Earn. Despite the University Council overturning the bar in 1934, Margaret was not reinstated in her post, and although her post was advertised, she was advised not to apply. During World War II Miller worked as a research strategist in Soviet affairs as part of the Political Intelligence Department's Foreign Research and Press Service in Oxford, at the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, and after the war she briefly worked in the Foreign Office's Economic Intelligence Department. After her appointment to the Central Electricity Authority, she continued to write, lecture and broadcast on Soviet economics until her death in 1979."

Her candidacy attracted national attention after she released a widely praised television advertisement that featured a former patient explaining how Wehby had saved her unborn daughter's life. However, the subsequent scrutiny uncovered allegations of stalking and harassment made against Wehby by former partners and found that significant parts of the policy platforms on her website had been plagiarised. Wehby struggled following these and other issues and ultimately lost the election to Merkley by a large margin, 55.8% to 37.1%."

After attending Georgia College she studied journalism at the University of Georgia in Athens. As a reporter for the Newnan Times-Herald, Barnes became interested in the 1948 case of John Wallace's murder of one of his tenant farmers. This interest lead to her book Murder in Coweta County which won an Edgar Allan Poe Award for an outstanding fact-crime study from the Mystery Writers of America. Murder in Coweta County was published in 1976 and made into a television movie starring Andy Griffith and Johnny Cash in 1983. Barnes' second book, A Buzzard is My Best Friend, was published in 1981. A Buzzard is My Best Friend was autobiographical, and dealt with her life in Virginia as a farmer, and earned Barnes a Georgia Author of the Year Award. Her third book, The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama, dealt with corruption and crime in Phenix City, Alabama, which is across the Chattahoochee River from Columbus, Georgia. Barnes died October 11, 2007 at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta of emphysema. She was 80 years old."

Timmerman and her 11-month-old daughter, Shannon, disappeared two days before Gabrion was set to stand trial on rape charges filed by Rachel the previous summer. Rachel's body was found in Oxford Lake, weighted down by cinder blocks. Shannon remains missing, but is presumed deceased. Gabrion is also a suspect in the disappearances of several other people, including a witness who was set to testify against him in the trial for rape. The case received national attention both for the brutality of the crime and for the controversial sentence. The crime was committed in Michigan, which does not have the death penalty, but prosecutors in federal court were able to seek a death sentence because the murder took place on federal land. Gabrion is the first person in the United States to receive the death penalty for a crime committed in a non-death penalty state since federal capital punishment was reinstated in 1988 as well as the first person to be sentenced to death in the state of Michigan since 1937."

  "text" : "Mikhail Aleksandrovich Kosenko (Russian: Михаил Александрович Косенко; born 8 July 1975) is a Russian activist who is a defendant in the Bolotnaya Square case. A participant in a protest against Russian President Vladimir Putin that took place in Bolotnaya Square in Moscow on May 6, 2012, the day before Putin’s third-term inauguration, Kosenko was charged with participating in “mass riots” and with “threatening the life or health of a representative of authority.” Although Kosenko and his fellow defendants in the case, Artiom Saviolov and Vladimir Akimenkov, professed their innocence and were backed up by ample video evidence, they were found guilty, with Kosenko sentenced to forced psychiatric treatment. Kosenko’s verdict and sentence were widely condemned as a political abuse of psychiatry, marking a return to the Soviet Union practice of sentencing dissidents to psychiatric hospitals, with one expert describing Kosenko’s case as “the first such clear and obvious instance” of “punitive psychiatry” in Russia since Soviet times."

  "text" : "Mariam [Meriam] Yahia Ibrahim Ishag or Maryam Yaḥyā Ibrahīm Isḥaq (مريم يحيى إبراهيم إسحق, born 3 November 1987 in Al Qadarif state, Sudan), Sudanese Religious Freedom activist and public speaker, is woman first sentenced to death because of her Christian faith and then released. Meriam Ibrahim was arrested during her second pregnancy and gave birth to a girl in prison on 27 May 2014. Mariam Ibrahim's case is part of a wider problem of persecution of Christians in Sudan. Meriam Ibrahim was born to a Muslim father, who left her Ethiopian Orthodox mother to raise her from early childhood. She was raised in her mother's faith and married a Christian man; the marriage certificate has been published. Meriam Ibrahim was reportedly turned in to the authorities by one of her relatives, who claimed Mariam was committing adultery by marrying Daniel Wani, a Christian. She was sentenced to death on 15 May 2014, for allegedly committing apostasy from Islam, meaning that she was accused of changing religion from Islam to a different (or no) religion. Although Meriam Ibrahim said she has always been a Christian, the prosecution claimed she should have followed the faith of her absent father, and demanded, with the support of the judge, that she abandon her Christian faith, and assent to belief in her father's faith, Islam. The judge told me that I needed to convert to Islam, and so these warnings made me anticipate I would be sentenced to death. (Meriam Ibrahim)  She was given three days to convert, but refused, arguing that she had been a Christian all her life, and could not rescind or alter her genuine personal faith at the request of a court. Her husband, Daniel Wani, appealed the sentence on both of their behalfs. On 24 June 2014 Meriam Ibrahim was released on the order of a Sudanese appeal court. The following day, as she and her family were to board a plane to the United States, she and her family were arrested and taken from the airport to Khartoum for questioning following a tip-off to the police by her half brother. The US Ambassador was summoned in protest at the granting of an exit visa, described by the Sudanese Foreign Ministry as 'a criminal violation'. Meriam Ibrahim was freed again on 26 June 2014 and took refuge in the United States embassy with her family. After extensive negotiations to enable her to leave Sudan, Meriam Ibrahim arrived in Rome on 24 July 2014 on an Italian government plane."

Morgan came to Fond du Lac in 1845 as a circuit rider, but a colleague would remember years later that while Noble was \"a man of superior talent\", his health proved unequal to the challenges of the role, and at the end of the two-year term he first \"took a location\" (i.e., ceased riding a circuit), and eventually sought a secular profession. While serving on the circuit, he was reportedly \"in great demand at all weddings.\" He and a fellow Methodist minister built a house which they shared in town, but when the two quarreled, they divided their interests by sawing the building in two."

He performed with Sims at Al Benson's rock and roll show in Chicago in November 1957, on a bill with Big Maybelle, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, The Dells and others. His final recordings, \"Love's Voodoo\" in 1958 and \"the Rock and Stomp\" in 1959, were released on his own label in Dallas. He was married, and at the end of his life worked in property maintenance. He died in Dallas, aged 47, in the early hours of September 10, 1977, as a result of a gunshot wound to the neck received during an altercation, and was buried in Carver Memorial Park."

He was born to Austrian-Brazilian parents who moved to Dresden when he was a small child. He began career as stage actor, but by the early 1930s was increasingly involved with the German film industry. He edited his first film in 1933. During the Nazi era he worked on a mixture of propaganda films and less overtly political entertainment such as To New Shores (1937) and the Marika Rökk vehicle Hello Janine! (1939). He often worked with the directors Douglas Sirk and Hans Steinhoff. After having previously made a couple of short films, Harbich directed Kriminalkommissar Eyck his first feature film in 1940. In 1946 he directed Free Land for DEFA in East Germany. The following year he returned to his native Brazil where he continued to work on films intermittently until the early 1960s."

  "text" : "Mandy Sayer (born 1963) is an Australian street performer-turned-writer (memoirist, novelist, poet, anthologist, reviewer, columnist). She was born in 1963 in the Sydney suburb of Marrickville, the third of three children. Her parents separated when she was aged ten. In 1983 she travelled to the United States with her father Gerry, a bohemian jazz performer. They busked together on the streets of New York, New Orleans and Colorado for three years; Gerry played drums and Mandy tap danced. In 1985 in New Orleans at Mardi Gras she met Yusef Komunyakaa, an African-American poet (later to win a Pulitzer Prize). They discovered a mutual interest in jazz and the novels of Patrick White. That year they married, and he became a professor at Indiana University, where she studied for an MA in English and Creative Writing with his financial support. They divorced in 1995, after the birth of his child from a one-night stand he had with a former girlfriend. During their marriage Sayer miscarried one child to him, and terminated another pregnancy against his wishes. She writes about this in her 2014 memoir The Poet's Wife. On return to Australia she gained a Doctorate from the University of Technology, Sydney. In 2003, she married novelist and playwright Louis Nowra, becoming his third wife. They had worked together when they co-edited the anthology In the Gutter ... Looking at the Stars in 2000. They have separate homes not far from each other near Kings Cross, in which their daytime writing activities are conducted, and they come together in the evening. In February 2014 they were named joint holders of the 2014 Copyright Agency Non-Fiction Writer-in-Residence at the University of Technology. She has won the Myrtle Armstrong Fiction Prize and the Keisler Poetry Award."

Brownell’s paintings are about the bizarre look nature has when seen from a scientific perspective, that is, reductively understood in scientific terms: They are about the estranging, unnatural effect the scientific conception of nature has on the appreciative perception of it.\"Brownell was born in 1971 in Chicago, Illinois to a sculptor, Nancy J. Schulson and a biophysicist, William E. Brownell. Mia began her academic training as a painter at the age of fourteen at the Baltimore School for the Arts. She attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the State University of New York, Buffalo. Her paintings are in several private, corporate, and public art collections including the National Academy of Sciences. In 2014 a traveling ten-year survey of her work accompanied a solo exhibition in New York City titled: “Delightful, Delicious, Disgusting: Paintings by Mia Brownell 2003-2013.” The exhibit traveled to museums in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Mia Brownell is a Professor of Art at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven."

After her graduation, she returned to the school and founded a mission club for Catholic students in 1905. While organizing the club, she met Father James A. Walsh, director of Boston’s Office for the Propagation of the Faith, later founder of Maryknoll Fathers & Brothers, through whom she was inspired to establish a mission congregation for women. Rogers moved to Boston in 1908 to teach at public schools and attend the Boston Normal School. The Maryknoll Sisters were founded in 1912. By 1955, the Maryknoll Sisters had over 1000 sisters working in some twenty countries."

  "text" : "Mike Rafferty (1926-2011) was an Irish traditional flute player. Rafferty was born on September 26, 1926 and grew up on a farm in Ballinakill, Co. Galway, Ireland. He learned music mainly from his father, Tom \"Barrel\" Rafferty who played the flute and uilleann pipes. Rafferty emigrated to the United States in 1949 and settled in northern New Jersey. He became known in the Irish traditional music scene in greater New York City and appeared at an extensive array of concerts and festivals all over US including the Smithsonian Institution’s Bicentennial Festival of American Folklife in 1976, and toured with the Green Fields of America. Rafferty was influential in helping Ireland's traditional music organization Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann (CCE) establish itself in North America through the Martin Mulvihill Branch; since then, a branch has been named after him, the Michael Rafferty Branch in New Jersey. Rafferty made three recordings with his daughter, multi-instrumentalist Mary Rafferty Clancy, a solo recording, and a recording with fiddler Willie Kelly. He taught extensively, both privately and at The Catskills Irish Week, the Augusta Heritage Center, and the New Jersey State Council on the Folk Arts Apprenticeship Program. In 2003, Rafferty was named Irish Echo's Traditional music of the Year; in 2010, he was awarded the National Heritage Award by the National Endowment for the Arts in 2010. With Paddy Carty, Jack Coen, and a few others, Rafferty was known as one of the best exponents of the East Galway style of flute playing, a rolling, lyrical style that is somewhat slower and less ornamented than other Irish traditional flute styles."

  "text" : "Mundiya Kepanga is a Papuan chief from the Tari region in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea. Originating from a traditional tribal community, Mundiya Kepanga has a unique vision on Western society, acquired following his multiple trips across Europe and North America. He is a seasoned speaker, regularly hosted by schools, natural history museums, scientists and assemblies devoted to indigenous people. Through his lectures, he seeks to raise awareness to the culture of his people while encouraging us to reflect upon our view of indigenous people and of ourselves. Among the actions he has taken to favor dialogue between cultures, he has made a gift of a complete set of his community's tribal costumes to the Museum of Natural History in Rouen (France). As well as putting into operation projects devoted to the preservation of the planet, he is the initiator of eco-development programs such as the creation of a traditional bed and breakfast, an essential resource for his village. Since 2000, several books and documentaries have been made on his perspective on the Western world such as \"Reversed Exploration\" (Production Bonne Pioche), which was broadcast by Canal+ and National Geographic in more than twenty countries. He also co-authored several scientific articles, including in collaboration with Yves Coppens and Jean Malaurie, in which he shared his vision of health, nature and environment. Invited as traditional chief to several meetings organized on the occasion of the COP21 Summit on climate change, he notably took part in the Indigenous People Facing Climate Change conference, organized at Musée de l'Homme in Paris joining Nicolas Hulot, Gilles Boeuf and Raoni Metuktire."

In 2009 he left politics and became CEO of Foreningen af Danske Interaktive Medier and after a company fusion became vice-CEO of Danske Medier in 2011. In September 2013, the Danish Social Liberal Party nominated him as their top candidate in the 2014 European Parliament election. Petersen won a seat in the parliament after the party received 6,7% of the votes in election; thus returning to the parliament with one mandate. Petersen is considered to belong to the right flank of the party and was opposed to the party's decision to be part of the Cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt."

Bracewell produced and/or directed six films and one documentary television series, most notably the short film Siren starring Craig Hall (actor) and Dean O'Gorman. The film screened at forty film festivals worldwide and was described by ImageOut as being \"A beautifully shot piece on the process of grief, this film deftly explores the conflicted emotions of a young soldier whose mysterious encounter with a siren allows him to come to terms with the loss of his best friend (and lover) in battle\". He co-hosted In The Pink, the first GLBTIQ show on an FM station in New Zealand, with Rick Huntington on Auckland's 95bFM Radio from 1991 to 1998. Miz Ima Starr cabaret shows include: \n* If Life Gives You Lemons at Festival of Voices and TasPride Festival;  \n* My Heart's A Drummer at Hobart Spiegeltent; \n* You Asked For It! at the Feast Festival and Adelaide Fringe; \n* Gender (Off)ender at the Sydney Opera House; \n* Bassey Your Ass Off at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival; \n* Welcome to Wherthehellawee! at Adelaide Fringe;  \n* Up The Disco at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival; \n* Hello Miz American Pie at Festival of Voices, Aroha Festival and the Melbourne Comedy Festival - where the show was reviewed as \"an expert blend of song and soliloquy retracing her fictional showbiz history\". Miz Ima Starr albums include My Heart's A Drummer and American Pie. Her duet with Baitercell of Trippin' (Push Push song) was originally recorded to promote the 95bFM float at the 1998 Hero Parade and was included on the soundtrack to the film I'll Make You Happy released by Flying Nun Records."

This army fought against the Arabs at Battle of Buwayb.

  "text" : "Moses Golola (Born 22 May 1980) is a Ugandan self-made celebrity, entertainer, and kickboxer known for building his personal brand. While his actual accomplishments as a kickboxer have been questioned by the media in Uganda, with accusations ranging from rigged events  to outright fraud, Golola has, nevertheless, been credited with popularizing the sport of kickboxing in Uganda (a discipline which previously generated minimal fan interest in Uganda)  and has managed to build up a large fan following in Uganda. His 2011 fight against Abdul Qadir Rahim managed to attract the largest attendance in Uganda outside of Ugandan national football team matches and Golola has perhaps the largest fan following in Uganda outside of the national football team. Golola has one of the largest online fan bases of anyone in Uganda. His fans have created various memes associated with Golola  and even their own parody version of Downfall starring Golola. He was also given the lead role in the Ugandan movie Christmas in Kampala. Golola is known for his humorous personality and flamboyant showmanship, traits which have helped him to popularize the sport of kickboxing in Uganda and helped him to gain a large fan following. He is the Kickboxing Champion of East and Central Africa having emerged winner in a controversial match against Hungarian Andras Nagy on 9 December 2011. Golola was involved in a financial dispute with his promoter at that time, Patrick Kanyomozi, and claimed that he was owed 30 million Ugandan shillings as his part of a 40-60 split from the fight. The dispute later caused him to split with Kanyomozi and introduce his own brother as his promoter."

Drawing a parallel between the oppression of men and women in Third World countries to the oppression experienced by lesbian and gay Asian Americans, she acknowledged they both stemmed from white racism. Fukaya called attention to both racism in the lesbian and gay movement as well as heterosexism in the growing Asian American community. Fukaya's writing appeared in publications such as Azalea: A Magazine by Third World Lesbians.

He has written several books devoted to the subject including The Path of the Righteous: Gentile Rescuers of Jews During the Holocaust published in 1993 by the KTAV Publishing House. Paldiel was born into a Hassidic family of Szlomo Wajsfeld, a diamond trader originally from Miechów near Kraków and Hinde née Labin from Uhnow (now Ukraine) as one of their five children before World War II. Thanks to a Catholic Priest who was able to smuggle them across the border, the family fled from Nazi occupied Belgium via France to Switzerland in 1940 when he was 3 years old. Later after the war the family emigrated to New York."

  "text" : "Mikhail Chapiro (also Shapiro; Russian: Михаил Шапиро; born 1938) is an artist of Russian Jewish origin currently living and working in Montreal, Canada. Chapiro was born in the Russian city of Novozybkov, near Belarus, in 1938. Soon thereafter his family moved to the nearby city of Gomel, Belarus, where Chapiro spent most of his childhood. During the German occupation of the western part of USSR (1941-1943) Chapiro's family was evacuated to the eastern part of Russia. Since his early childhood, Chapiro was captivated by painting. Thanks to his teachers, Peter Chernyshevsky and Boris Zvenigorodsky, the artists of great experience and talent, this endowment became his predilection, the raison d'être of his life. After 6 years of studies, he graduated from the Mukhina Institute of Arts and Industrial Design in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy). After graduation he was sent for obligatory work (as was practiced in the USSR) to the capital of Siberia, the city of Novosibirsk, where he spent 7 years working for the government as a stylist, and in his free time, at nights, working on his paintings. In 1974 Chapiro left Novosibirsk and moved to Moscow where he joined the Russia's underground avant-garde movement and regularly exhibited his works at the avant-garde center at Malaya Gruzinskaya 28, which in 1981 became the home of his solo exhibition. Like all underground artists, he was prosecuted by the Soviet regime. However, he was recognized by Russian intellectual elite, by scientists, especially physicists, by sportsmen, poets, musicians and artists. Only with Perestroyka he was recognized by a wider public. From 1988 to 1990 his paintings were exhibited at the Moscow Modern Art Gallery MARS. Chapiro immigrated to Canada from Russia in 1992. The themes of his paintings are portraits, landscapes, cityscapes, animals, flowers, and abstract works. The manner of Chapiro's paintings is a mixture of realism and abstraction. Chapiro paints mainly in oil on canvas. He is an author of portraits of Soviet physicists, such as Andrey Sakharov, Lev Landau, Evgeny Lifshitz, Mikhail Leontovich, Igor Tamm, Lev Artsimovich, Abram Ioffe. He is an author of a portrait of Russian ballerina Maya Plisetskaya. The painting is currently owned by St. Petersburg Museum for Theatre Arts. The portrait of Soviet composer Dmitry Shostakovich by Chapiro was exhibited at various exhibitions in New York and New Jersey. Chapiro's works represented at the Museum of Russian Art in New York. His personal exhibitions are regularly held in Montreal. His recent exhibition at Galerie Michel-Ange, Montreal, Canada, has included 15 portraits of most famous artists of 19-th and 20-th centuries, such as Claude Monet, Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso, Kazimir Malevich and others."

For models and other artwork outside of special effects, Trcic commonly consults with paleontologists in order to achieve a high standard of accuracy for his work. His sculpture has been compared to that of Brian Cooley, but with a \"somewhat more traditional\" style. He has provided dinosaur sculpture work for a variety of media and institutions, including IMAX, The University of Chicago, The National Geographic Society, Disney, and the Arizona Museum of Natural History, where his life-sized bronze Dilophosaurus sculpture is featured. His statue of the sauropod dinosaur Jobaria can be viewed at the Navy Pier of Chicago, Illinois. Trcic's work has also been published in a variety of written media, including Random House's book Hunting Dinosaurs and the magazines Earth Magazine and Prehistoric Times. Outside of dinosaur-related work, Trcic has also worked alongside the horror and sci-fi directors Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton, George Romero, Sam Raimi and James Cameron on \"Jurassic Park\", Batman Returns, Dawn of the Dead, Evil Dead 2, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, respectively. Trcic's film work has received multiple awards and distinctions, including Oscars for both Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park. He was also the recipient of the Lanzendorf PaleoArt Prize in 3-dimensional art in both 2000 and 2001. Trcic lives in Sedona, Arizona, where he has created Fine Art Bronze in Wildlife and Western Figurative."

As a junior runner, he represented his native country of Morocco at the 1981 World Cross Country Championships. His career shows no results through most of the typically peak running years of an athlete, their 20's. After undergoing a change in eligibility, he represented France first in the 1993 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships then in many cross country International championships; the 1994 and 1996 European Cross Country Championships and the 1994, 1997, 1999 and 2000 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. Just months after the 2000 Cross Country meet, on July 3, Ezzher ran the 5,000 metres in Sotteville in 13:43.15. The time beat the masters M40 world record that had been held by Frenchman Lucien Rault for 24 years. He has held that record since that date. No other man has come within much more than 10 seconds of his time."

  "text" : "Magne Rommetveit (4 October 1918 – 6 January 2009) was a Norwegian lexicographer. He was born in Stord. He finished his secondary education in Voss in 1940 and took the cand.philol. degree in 1950. He worked as a lexicographer associated with the University of Oslo, and eventually became a docent and professor of Nynorsk philology from 1978 to 1988. He was involved in Nynorskordboka and Norsk ordbok, but his main work was the agricultural lexicon Norsk landbruksordbok. Commencing the work in 1955, it was published at Samlaget in 1978 with 80,000 entries. He later wrote the more popular book on Nynorsk synonyms, Med andre ord. Published in 1985 as a follow-up of the earlier På godt norsk, it was reissued several times. He was a co-founder of several Nynorsk institutions in Oslo: Kringkastingsringen which fought for Nynorsk use in the NRK, where he was general manager from 1955 to 1970; the weekly newspaper Dag og Tid in 1962 for which he coined the name; and the news agency Nynorsk Pressekontor in 1969. He became an honorary member of Noregs Mållag in 1998."

Tall, pock-marked and having a pink complexion, Mam Nai impressed both Nate Thayer and François Bizot as the most frightening Khmer Rouge individual they ever beheld. Bizot further described Mam Nai as a 'true crime fiction character' with a terrifying 'gallows face'. He met him twice at the French Embassy compound in Phnom Penh, the second time during the arrest of Sirik Matak who had been hiding seeking political asylum."

  "text" : "Mirian Giorgadze (Georgian: მირიან გიორგაძე; born March 25, 1976 in Terjola) is a retired amateur Georgian Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's super heavyweight category. He represented his nation Georgia in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), and nearly ended his sporting campaign with a blistering bronze medal effort at the 2005 European Championships in Varna, Bulgaria. Giorgadze also trained as part of the Greco-Roman wrestling team for Dynamo Tbilisi under his personal coach Vasha Kraveshvili. Giorgadze made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's super heavyweight division (130 kg). He lost two straight matches each to Sweden's Eddy Bengtsson and Belarus' Dmitry Debelka, who later claimed a bronze medal at the end of the tournament in the prelim pool, finishing last out of twenty wrestlers in the overall standings. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Giorgadze qualified for his second Georgian squad in the men's 120 kg class by receiving a berth and placing third from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. Since his previous Games, Giorgadze could not recover a setback from his former rival Bengtsson on the opening bout, but managed to break a 2–2 draw and score a single triumph over Kazakhstan's Georgiy Tsurtsumia. Giorgadze's devised game plan did not effectively accomplish, as he was haplessly pinned by the host nation's Xenofon Koutsioumpas and Sweden's Eddy Bengtsson without receiving a single point, finishing third in the prelim pool and fifteenth in the overall rankings."

  "text" : "Marion Gering (June 9, 1901, Rostov-on-Don – April 19, 1977, New York City) was a Russian-born American stage producer and director. He moved to the United States in 1924 as a member of a Soviet trade commission in trading Siberian furs. He became involved in the theatrical community in Chicago, founding the Chicago Play Producing Company. His production of Georg Kaiser's \"Gas\", which was presented at the Goodman Theatre on January 28, 1926 was particularly successful. In 1927 he began producing plays in New York City, and married actress Dorothy Libaire in 1930. Gering became a Hollywood film director for Paramount Pictures in 1931, directing Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard in I Take This Woman on his debut. In 1932 he directed Tallulah Bankhead, Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, and a young Cary Grant in Devil and the Deep. He collaborated several times with producer Albert Lewis, producing films together like Ready for Love and later stage productions like The Walking Gentleman at the Playhouse Theatre. In 1935 he directed George Raft and Carole Lombard in the film Rumba, inspired by the success of Bolero the previous year, but it wasn't as successful. Gering's stint with Paramount came to an end in 1936, and he then joined Columbia Pictures between 1937 and 1939, and directed the 1937 British picture Thunder in the City for the Atlantic Film Company. His film career came to a halt by the end of the decade. He tried in the subsequent period, albeit in vain, to build on his previous accomplishments as a theatre producer and to pursue film directing in Europe. Between 1947 and 1949 he attempted to relaunch his film career in Cuba but with little success. In 1950 he briefly returned to film directing Michael Whalen, Doris Dowling and Tommy Wonder in the musical drama Sarumba. He later reportedly worked as a technical assistant and caretaker in colleges. He directed the sexploitation film Violated Paradise (1963)."

  "text" : "Mary Ellen Morris (née Mulry; 15 February 1921 – 1997) was an Irish nurse and writer, known for her war diaries during the second world war. These are stored at the Imperial War Museum and in June 2014 were published under the title 'A Very Private Diary', a reference to one diary entry: \"15 June 1944, Bognor Regis: Should have headed this 'Somewhere in Southern England' but this is a very private diary...\" Mary was born in County Galway, Ireland. She left her home at age 18, after passing the examination to train at Guy’s Hospital in London as a nurse probationer. After training, she was transferred to Kent. Her diaries start here with the arrival of survivors from the Dunkirk evacuation, and subsequently, injured pilots from the Battle of Britain. Here she also underwent training in fever nursing, a specialisation prior to antibiotics when whooping cough and diphtheria were fatal. Working at the 'home front' during The Blitz, Mary spent many nights moving very ill children and babies from their beds to safer underground shelters. Despite the wishes of her matron, Mary enlists with the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service Reserves, known as the QAs. It is with the QAs that she is dispatched to Normandy on a troopship on June 18, 12 days after D-Day. The field hospital follows the troops into Belgium, where she cares for survivors of the disastrous assault on Arnhem, and then later into Germany. During her active service in Belgium she met her future husband, Malcolm Morris, in 1945. The diary ends in 1947 with the birth of their son, Michael."

  "text" : "Marek Sitnik (born April 20, 1975 in Olsztyn) is a retired amateur Polish Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's heavyweight category. Sitnik has claimed two silver medals in the 90-kg division at the 1993 and 1994 European Junior Championships, and later represented his nation Poland in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Sitnik trained full-time for Śląsk Wrestling Club in Wrocław, under his personal coach and mentor Jerzy Adamek. Sitnik made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's super heavyweight division (130 kg). Sitnik delivered a mediocre effort inside the ring after losing out three straight matches each to Turkey's Fatih Bakir by a sudden death point, Czech Republic's David Vála (0–3), and Israel's Yuri Evseitchik, who eventually placed fourth at the end of prelim pool. Sitnik failed to advance further into the quarterfinals, as he finished seventeenth in the final standings. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Sitnik qualified for his second team, as a 29-year-old veteran, in the men's 96 kg class by rounding out the top eleven spots from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Créteil, France. He lost his opening match to Egypt's Karam Gaber, who later took home the gold at the end of the tournament, but redeemed himself to pull Kazakhstan's Asset Mambetov off the mat on his second bout with an effortless 3–0 decision. Facing off against the host nation's Georgios Koutsioumpas and by the delight of the crowd inside the Ano Liossa Olympic Hall, Sitnik could not exert enough power to subdue him into the ring, and lost the match by a quick single-point deficit. Finishing third in the prelim pool and fourteenth overall in the final standings, Sitnik's performance fell short to put him further into the game."

After the defeat of his father in 977 at the hands of his relative 'Adud al-Dawla, he, along with his father and uncles went to Damascus, where they were warmly received by its ruler, Alptakin, who, however, made them involved in his conflict with the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. A battle shortly ensured at Ramla between the army of Alptakin and the Fatimids. However, during the battle, Marzuban betrayed Alptakin and abandoned the battlefield. The forces of Alptakin were shortly defeated, and Marzuban's uncle Abu Tahir was killed, while his other uncle Abu Ishaq Ibrahim was taken captive by the Fatimids.

  "text" : "Júlia Malvina Hailliot Tavares (or Malvina Tavares ; Encruzilhada do Sul, 24 November 1866 — Cruzeiro do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, 16 October 1939) was one of the most active Brazilian militant anarchists, as well as a poet and a pioneer of modern education in southern Brazil. She was responsible for the creation of a secular school, the \"Modern School of Francisco Ferrer\", in the municipality of São Gabriel do Lajeado, which educated generations of libertarians. Tavares was the daughter of François de Lalemode Hailliot and Henriette Souleaux Hailliot, immigrant Frenchmen who came to Brazil in the mid-19th century. In her diary, she refers to the fact that her mother was born in a castle in Bordeaux implying a possible aristocratic origin of her mother's family. In the late 1880s, Tavares was sent to the Brazilian capital to study teaching at the Normal School of Porto Alegre. She studied with another future libertarian pedagogue Ana Amaral Lisboa Aurora. In 1890, she married the Portuguese trader, José Joaquim Tavares. In 1898, Tavares and her husband moved to Encruzilhada do Sul, and two years later, they moved to São Gabriel da Estrela. Despite adversity, Tavares persisted in her role as a teacher, taking herself with educating rural children. As a teacher, she abolished corporal punishment to learners, very common at the time, and went on to innovate in educational methods, abolishing religious education, and adopting revolutionary proposals by the anarchist Catalan educator, Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia."

Although Crain played as an offensive tackle, he was switched to center in 1963 and was voted at that position as an East All-Star. However, in 1964, the Alouettes had many problems on offense, winding up the season as the lowest scoring team in the east, and he was released after playing only 4 games.

Active in the first Romanian socialist party, the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party, he became dissatisfied with the party's passivity and its failure to openly support political rights for the Romanian Jews, initiating a separate Jewish socialist group. Following the party's demise, he was one of the main activists for the revival of the socialist movement in Iaşi, introducing to Marxism many future leaders of the Romanian socialist parties. Sympathetic to the 1917 February Revolution, he was arrested after attempting to gain the support of Russian soldiers present in the country during World War I. Wexler was assassinated in custody shortly after, with the Romanian authorities suppressing any formal enquiry into his death."

Since the 1990s, Fisher has also been producing paintings and installation works. His work has been included in three Whitney Biennial exhibitions, 1985, 2004 and 2014. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1987. Fisher's work has been noted for its relationship to the Southern California landscape and its architecture during a time when the region was staking an aesthetic and intellectual claim in the larger art world. Curator and critic Stuart Comer writes, \"Windshields, billboards, movie screens, ocean views, econ-o-box apartment buildings and long expanses of asphalt and concrete form a unique Angeleno vocabulary of monochrome surfaces on which the symbolic configuration called California is played out. This seemingly limitless expanse of flat planes is the arena in which Fisher has staked his challenge to existing regimes of representation and narrative.\""

  "text" : "Mahsa Vahdat (in Persian مهسا وحدت) (born 29 October 1973, Teheran, Iran) is an Iranian artist and singer and strong advocate of Freedom of expression. Her music style is contemporary expression inspired by old traditional and folk and regional music of Iran that she developed for many years and it is the result of work with many musicians from Iran and other countries. She writes most of her songs. In her music she also developed dialogue between other cultures in a high artistic quality and she got a huge response internationally. The text of her work is contemporary texts of different Iranian poets and classic poetry of Persian poets such as Hafez, Rumi, Hallaj and Tahereh Ghoratolein. She has released materials with her sister Marjan Vahdat (in Persian مرجان وحدت). as in albums Songs from a Persian Garden, I Am Eve and Twinklings of Hope. After learning to play piano, she studied traditional Persian singing from Pari Meleki and Mehdi Fallah and also studied setar with Ramin Kakavand then with Masoud Shoari. In 1993, she entered Tehran University obtaining a BA in Music from the university's music faculty, working alongside Sharif Lotfi, Ahmad Pejman, Hooshang Zarif, Behnam Vadani, Abdorreza Sajadi, Hushang Kamkar, and Mohammad Reza Darvishi. Her career in Iran was curtailed after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, when Ayatollah Khomeini decreed that women would no longer be allowed to sing solo in public, unless the audience was exclusively made of women. Most of her later materials were recorded outside Iran where she enjoys great fame with the Iranian diaspora and in world music circles. She has been living in Iran despite the restrictions in her career as she thinks it is so important to live in Iran. She encourages many women to learn and keep the Persian vocal arts. In Iran she teaches Persian traditional singing in her home, she has many students that come with dedication and they are so serious even though they do not see any bright landscape for singing officially. Mahsa encourages them a lot for keeping this tradition and she believes that they have a big role in keeping the treasure of this music for future and next generations ,they can transmit this music to their children and people among them and It keeps the female and also traditional Persian music alive. If she finds any international possibility to present her students or any talent, she encourages and helps them to take part.Following her participation in Lullabies from the Axis of Evil (2004), Mahsa started a long lasting collaboration with the Norwegian record label Kirkelig Kulturverksted (KKV) and producer Erik Hillestad, which led to a world wide release of a series of records. Since 2007 Mahsa has been one of the ambassadors of Freemuse Organization, an independent international organization that advocates freedom of expression for musicians and composers worldwide. In 2010, she was granted the Freemuse Award. Since 1995 Mahsa has performed as an independent artist in concerts and festivals in Asia, Europe, the US, and Africa together with musicians from Iran, Europe and America. All her works mean a lot for Iranian people in different layers of society and also for non Iranian audiences. In Iran she has a huge amount of fans in the younger generations and she developed a style based on traditional music that could impress young generations. She is one of singers that could attract a young generation to traditional and Persian classical music and poetry with her new musical expression rooted in tradition and regional music of Iran.Mahsa Vahdat has worked with many acclaimed musicians in the world such as Tord Gustavsen, Knut Riersrud, Pasha Hanjani, Atabak elyasi, Shervin Mohajer, Mathias Eick, SKRUK Choir, and Mighty Sam Mcclain. In 2007 she recorded “Songs from a Persian Garden “ in a charity concert in Tehran in the residence of Italian embassy in cooperation with UN for disabled children in Zahedan and it was released in 2007 in Norway and Europe and America. It was a mix ensemble of Norwegian and Iranian musicians together with her sister Marjan Vahdat as another lead singer. It has been arranged by Knut Reiersrud (famous Norwegian guitarist and musician).In 2008 she released I am Eve Album with her sister Marjan Vahdat that has a strong message for women in Iran, the lyrics of the first track “I am Eve“ is so strong and it expresses the power of women who have many restrictions under Iranian government .It has been arranged by Atabak Elyasi (Iranian composer).The album received many attention in world music societies and people in Iran and excellent reviews in world music magazines such as froots ,songlines and many other reviews. In 2009 she released “Scent of Reunion “ (love duets across civilizations) together with Mighty Sam McClain (American Blues singer) with KKV .The idea was based on poetic dialogue between an Iranian Poet (Mohammad Ebrahim Jafari) and Norwegian Poet (Erik Hillestad) about love .The importance of the album apart from its artistic value, that It was a dialogue between two singers that live in two countries who has no diplomatic relations and the two countries regarded each other as enemies. The message is strong “Love has no border “and no difference in culture and religion can stop lovers from searching each other in this planet. Mahsa and Sam both came from a society that suffered discrimination ,Sam because of the color of his skin in America (many years of his life) and Mahsa as a woman and also female singer in Iran .This project was recorded exactly before June 2009 Presidential election in Iran where the society of Iran was full of hope and people wanted to change their future and It was released after people ‘s uprising and green movement, where the situation was full of pain and tension. Even this project was about love but It was extremely well received in Iranian society and got a huge amount of attention and popularity among people and also musicians and many regard it as an important music event . It was also well received in many world music societies. It was arranged by Knut Reirsrud .In 2010 she released “I vinens Speil” (In the mirror of wine ) album with KKV. It was recorded with Norwegian Choir SKRUK and was arranged by Tord Gustavsen acclaimed Norwegian jazz Pianist .The idea started when Mahsa and Erik Hillestad started to work on Hafez poems and in the Jakob church in Oslo they started to use the translation of poem of Hafez in the Mass of that church every Sunday and It was a dialogue and presentation of Mystical old poems in Mass. It was an opportunity to introduce Persian poetry to society in Norway. Later Mahsa and Hillestad translated one hundred of Hafez' poems to Norwegian in a book (Hafez, Ivinense speil ,100 utvalgte dikt) that was published in 2010 in Norway by www.forlagetpress.no. It was the result of some years research. Hafez poem and the message that his poems have for Iranian society for centuries was very interesting and the book and the album had a lot of meaning for many Norwegians and also immigrant society in Norway. She also made a concert again In the residence of Italian embassy in Tehran with the whole choir in Tehran in May 2011 despite of many problems that security police of government created in front of the door of embassy and prevented some guests to come to concert .This Hafez project also was arranged in smaller setting as Hafez quartet and they had a tour on many schools in Norway in purpose of presenting Iranian culture and poetry for young generation in Norway in the time when people just see the dark political aspect of Iranian society and It had a big influence and It meant for many Iranian immigrants in Norway.In 2011 she released \"Twinklings of Hope\" together with her sister as another lead singer. This project was with Iranian ensemble and It was recorded in Italian embassy in an Persian old house and It was released by KKV .The lyrics are by some old classical and also some contemporary poets .The last track “Twinkings of hope “ (Daram Omidi ) is about hope and it is encouraging for many people. Twinklings of Hope is among Songlines Magazine’s editor’s choice selection of the 10 best new releases (Top of the World) in August–September 2012. Mahsa & Marjan Vahdat took top honors in the category of world traditional album with album Twinklings of Hope in the 12th annual International Independent Music awards in the US. In 2012 she also released album A deeper Tone of longing that is another love duet together with Mighty Sam Mcclain. It is the follow up of Scent of Reunion album and the idea is the same and it received excellent reviews from world music society and Downbeat Magazine.In 2013 she produced the album Blue Fields for Marjan Vahdat solo album together with Erik Hillestad.

Gochev qualified for the Bulgarian squad, as a 31-year-old veteran, in the men's 84 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by receiving an allocated berth from the International Federation of Associated Wrestling (FILA). Facing against two Olympic medalists from Sydney four years earlier, Gochev opened an astonishing 4–2 victory over Macedonia's Mogamed Ibragimov, but could not push South Korean wrestler Moon Eui-Jae off the mat, and suffered a defeat by a 5–9 score at the end of the round-robin. Finishing second in the prelim pool and twelfth overall, Gochev's performance was not enough to advance him to the quarterfinals."

  "text" : "Margaret Pinkley Varda (June 30, 1917 – February 13, 2011) was an American lawyer and politician. Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Varda received her bachelor's degree from what is now the University of Wisconsin–Madison and her law degree from University of Wisconsin Law School. She was one of the first 100 women to earn a law degree from the school. In 1941, she married John P. Varda whom she meet in law school. They then moved to Eagle River, Wisconsin where they open a law office: Varda & Varda. John P. Varda ran for and won a seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly on the Wisconsin Progressive Party ticket. John Varda resigned from the Wisconsin Assembly and joined the United States Army during World War II. Margaret Varda then ran for her husband's seat and was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly. She did not seek re-election and joined the Women's Army Corps in the United States Army during the war. She was assigned to the European theater and had the good fortune to be located only 50 miles from her husband, who, by the time she arrived, was serving as Deputy Military Governor in Aschaffenburg, Germany. She became pregnant with their first child, John Duncan, and returned to the United States. In 1950, Varda and her husband moved to Madison, Wisconsin and her husband was named general manager of the Wisconsin Motor Carriers Association (WMCA). In 1952, Varda ran in the Republican primary for a Wisconsin Assembly seat and lost the election, mainly for her refusal to endorse the politics of Senator Joseph McCarthy. She turned her focus to raising four sons and remained active as a public member on Joint Legislative Council committees regarding government taxes and operations (1964), educational reorganization (1968), and the Coordinating Committee on Higher Education (1962), which set the ground work for the consolidation of higher educational institutions into the University of Wisconsin system. In 1981, Varda and her husband moved to Hurley, Wisconsin when John Varda became a Wisconsin Circuit Court judge. In 2003, Varda moved back to Madison, Wisconsin. She lived there until her death in 2011. Varda had four sons: John Duncan Varda (attorney); Michael Varda (attorney); Anthony Varda (attorney); and Richard Varda (architect)."

  "text" : "Martin Powell, (fl. 1709–1720; d. 1729) was an Irish master puppeteer and puppet show impresario, who put on a repertoire of satirical and parodical marionette shows that invariably featured the Punch character. He drew audiences first at provincial towns such as Bath, then moving his venue to London. His theatre (dubbed \"Punch's Opera\" or \"Punch's Theatre\") established itself in early 1710 at its first location, at the north end of St. Martin's Street intersected by Litchfield St., not quite in Covent Garden. But by 1711 he relocated the theatre to the galleries of Covent Garden, at Little Piazza, opposite St. Paul's Church. He has been credited with establishing the stock form of the Punch and Judy plays. Charles Magnin, the learned author of the Histoire des Marionnettes en Europe, calls the years of Powell's pre-eminence \"the golden age of marionettes in England.\" It has been commented \"Powell is described as a deformed cripple but his powers of satire were considerable,\" to the extent that the ministry recruited Powell to lampoon the French prophets to diminish their influence among the populace. He not only narrated (spoke the lengthy prologues), with a wand in hand, but was a puppeteer himself, and he is thought to have built his own puppet figures and written the plays himself. A modern-day scholar assesses the period of Powell's prominent activity to be 1709–1720, the popularity of his puppetry having waned in the latter years, \"his son briefly carried on the tradition in the [1720s]\", and he died 1729."

  "text" : "Marie Purvis (born 24 September 1961), now known as Marie Morgan, is a British former racing cyclist who represented Great Britain at the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics. She won the British National Road Race Championships on five occasions. Purvis had excelled as a runner in her school years, scoring a top 15 finish in the English Schools National Cross-Country Championship, but gave up the sport after suffering a serious calf injury at the age of 19. She subsequently married John Purvis, a Manx cyclist who had finished fourth in the road race at the 1978 Commonwealth Games. Marie initially took up cycling at the age of 26 to improve her fitness, but soon progressed into competition, twice breaking the Isle of Man women's 10-mile time trial record in 1988. She was selected to represent the Isle of Man at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, and in the same year won her first British Road Racing title - she dominated the event in the first half of the 1990s, winning five out of six editions of the national championships from 1990 to 1995. She finished fourth in the road race at the 1994 Commonwealth Games. She became the first British rider to win a stage of the modern Tour de France Féminin since its establishment in 1984 when she won a stage of the 1993 race, following it up with another stage win in the 1995 edition. Purvis set a new British hour record at Manchester Velodrome on 10 March 1995, beating Mandy Jones' previous mark set in 1981 by over two kilometres. She scored her best result at the Olympics in the 1996 Games road race, when she finished 11th. She retired from international competition the same year. In 2001 she returned to her roots in athletics when she won gold in the half-marathon at the 2001 Island Games."

  "text" : "Robert Martin McBirney QC (1922–16 September 1974), known as Martin McBirney, was a magistrate and politician from Northern Ireland who was assassinated. McBirney studied law at Trinity College Dublin and became a barrister in Belfast, before being called to the bar at Gray's Inn. In his spare time, he became active in the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP), and served on its executive from 1964-67. In 1966-67, he was also party Chairman. He combined these roles as the first Chairman of the Northern Ireland Society of Labour Lawyers. McBirney stood for the NILP in Belfast Willowfield at the Northern Ireland general election, 1965, taking 35.1% of the vote. He was next a candidate in East Belfast at the 1966 general election, and took 45.3% of the vote in one of the party's best ever results, although he was not elected. His final contest was Belfast Pottinger at the Northern Ireland general election, 1969, where he took 48.6% of the vote and was fewer than two hundred votes short of being elected. In the 1970s, McBirney focused on his legal career. He was made a Queen's Counsel, was appointed a resident magistrate, and served as Senior Crown Prosecutor for Belfast. He worked as a lawyer for the defence on civil rights cases, including one involving the Derry Citizens' Action Committee, in which he defended, among others, Eamonn McCann. On the morning of 16 September 1974, McBirney was shot dead at his house on Belmont Road, East Belfast. He was killed in the attack, on the same day that another judge, Rory Conaghan, was murdered. Both murders have been attributed to the Irish Republican Army. On hearing of McBirney's death, his sister-in-law, Frances Cooke, suffered a fatal heart attack. McBirney was a Protestant who had married a Roman Catholic. The couple had one child. He was friendly with politician Paddy Devlin, with playwright Sam Thompson and poet Louis MacNeice. He personally wrote documentaries and plays for the BBC, including one on Daniel O'Connell. McBirney appeared as a contestant on the Round Britain Quiz."

In June 2014, the democratic bloc, which became a major force inside the coalition, voted Nyrabia to be its candidate to preside over the coalition, after Ahmad Jarba, who is a member of the same bloc.

He was first elected to Parliament in a by-election in July 1995, representing the Tewai-Siassi constituency (in Morobe Province). In July 1997, Prime Minister Bill Skate appointed him Minister for Defence, then reshuffled him in December to the position of Minister for Housing. Skate briefly shuffled him to the position of Minister for Forests in July 1998, then back to Minister for Housing in October. Out of the Cabinet from June 1999, he was back in it from December, this time under Prime Minister Mekere Morauta, as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Livestock. He held the position until November 2000, when Morauta sacked him, accusing him of disloyalty. In April 2003, the Leadership Tribunal found Mao guilty on nine charges \"relating to use of his discretionary funds to pay companies owned or controlled by his associates\". On recommendation of the Tribunal, which deemed him \"unworthy to continue in office\" for his mishandling of millions of kina, he was dismissed from Parliament in May by the Governor-General. Returning to Parliament in the 2012 general election, as a member of incumbent Prime Minister Peter O'Neill's People's National Congress Party, he was appointed Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources. In June 2015, he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George \"for services to the community and to politics\"."

  "text" : "Mihai Dumitru Ralea (also known as Mihail Ralea, Michel Raléa, or Mihai Rale; May 1, 1896 – August 17, 1964) was a Romanian social scientist, cultural journalist, and political figure. He debuted as an affiliate of Poporanism, the left-wing agrarian movement, which he infused with influences from corporatism and Marxism. A distinguished product of French academia, Ralea rejected traditionalism and welcomed cultural modernization, outlining the program for a secular and democratic \"peasant state\". His ideology blended into his scholarly work, with noted contributions to political sociology, the sociology of culture, and social and national psychology. He was a professor at the University of Iași and, from 1938, the University of Bucharest. By 1935, Ralea had become a doctrinaire of the National Peasants' Party, managing Viața Românească review and Dreptatea daily. He had publicized polemics with the far-right circles and fascist Iron Guard, which he denounced as alien to the Romanian ethos. He later drifted apart from the party's centrist leadership and his own democratic ideology, setting up a Socialist Peasants' Party, then embracing authoritarian politics. He was a founding member and Labor Minister of the dictatorial National Renaissance Front, representing its corporatist left-wing. He fell from power in 1940, finding himself harassed by successive fascist regimes, and became a \"fellow traveler\" of the underground Communist Party. Ralea willingly cooperated with the communists and the Ploughmen's Front before and after their arrival to power, serving as Minister of Arts, Ambassador to the United States, and vice president of the Great National Assembly. He was sidelined, then recovered, by the communist regime, and, as a Marxist humanist, was one of its leading cultural ambassadors by 1960. Always an avid traveler and raconteur, Ralea died abroad, while on mission to the UNESCO. He endures in cultural memory as a controversial figure. He is celebrated for his sociological and critical insights, but reprehended for his nepotism, his political choices, and his literary compromises."

Jimeno, who lived in Monterey, also was given land grants Rancho Salsipuedes (1840) in Santa Cruz County and Rancho Santa Paula y Saticoy (1843) in Ventura County and Rancho Jimeno (1844) in what is now Colusa County and Yolo County, California. Unlike many land grants holders, Jimeno was not required to show any use or development of the land and apparently he did not use the land, either for agriculture or ranching.

  "text" : "Muzaffar Abdul-Majid Al-Nawab (Arabic: مظفر عبدالمجيد النواب) is one of Iraq’s most famous and influential poets. Al-Nawab has family origins tracing back to India. Al Nawab was born in Baghdad, in 1934, where he completed his undergraduate studies from the University of Baghdad. He joined the Iraqi Communist Party and was tortured by the Hashemite Government. After the Iraqi revolution in 1958 which overthrew the monarchy, he was appointed as an inspector at the Ministry of Education. In 1963 he was forced to leave Iraq, after the intensification of competition between the nationalists and the communists who were exposed to prosecution and strict observation by the ruling regime. He was arrested and tortured by the Iranian secret police, before being repatriated to the Iraqi government. He was handed down a death sentence for one of his poems, which was later commuted to life imprisonment. He escaped prison by digging a tunnel and fled to the marshlands, where he joined a communist faction that sought to overthrow the government. Known for his powerful revolutionary poems and scathing invectives against Arab dictators, he lived in exile in many countries, including Syria, Egypt, Lebanon and Eritrea, where he stayed with the Eritrean rebels, before returning to Iraq in 2011. Before he returned to Iraq, he had been essentially stateless being able to travel only through Libyan travel documents. The first complete Arabic language edition of his works was published in London in 1996 by \"Dar Qanbar\""

  "text" : "Maryam Henein is a journalist, filmmaker and entrepreneur. She directed the documentary Vanishing of the Bees and is founder of HoneyColony.com. A native of Montreal, Canada, Henein is of Egyptian Canadian heritage. Henein interviewed documentarian Morgan Spurlock for Penthouse, as well as produced documentaries for the UK’s September Films on subjects that include pimps, drug dealers and porn stars in the Los Angeles area. She was also part of First Apartment, a reality show webcast in the late '90s and early 2000s on the now-defunct website crushedplanet.com, produced by Taxicab Confessions' Joe and Harry Gantz. Following a near-fatal pedestrian versus car crash that dragged her for 49 feet, which broke her leg, vertebrae and several ribs and necessitated a titanium rod for her recovery in 2002, she researched issues of health and nutrition to help her in her recovery and became aware of colony collapse disorder. With George Langworthy, Henein directed the 2009 documentary (which took five years to produce), Vanishing of the Bees with Ellen Page narrating the fillm. Since the release of Vanishing of the Bees, Henein has become an outspoken advocate of bees and bee colonies, non-GMO foods and the release of pesticides into the environment. Henein is the founder of HoneyColony Inc., a member supported online magazine that hosts a number of optimized-health and investigative writers called \"Hive Advisers\". Henein continues to work on projects involving bees and contamination of the food supply. She is working on a memoir titled Of Bees & Men and launched a year-long Save the Bees campaign in June 2014."

The names Linda, Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen are aliases created by Bob Mitchell in an effort to protect their identities. The girls' real names were put under a publication ban by the crown at the time because they were under 18 at the time of the murder. Linda Andersen's murder case was broadcast on the television series Deadly Women in 2010, and was the subject of Bob Mitchell's book The Class Project: How to Kill a Mother: The True Story of Canada's Infamous Bathtub Girls. In 2014, a crime drama film, Perfect Sisters, was released, which was additionally based on the murder of Linda Andersen."

  "text" : "Makhluf Haddadin is a Jordanian chemistry professor at the American University of Beirut. Makhluf J. Haddadin was born in Ma'in, Jordan. He won a full scholarship, by the Jordanian Ministry of Education, to study Chemistry at the American University of Beirut from which he graduated with a B.Sc. and an M.Sc. (Professor C. H. Issidorides) degrees. And thereafter, left for the University of Colorado Boulder, Colorado, USA where he received a Ph.D. degree in Organic Chemistry (Professor Alfred Hassner). After two years of postdoctoral work (Professor Louis Fieser) at Harvard University, he joined the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the American University of Beirut where he is now a Professor of Chemistry. Professor Haddadin considers himself a Heterocyclic Chemist whose contribution to this field of Chemistry is topped by his co-invention, with Emeritus Professor Costas H. Issidorides, of what is currently known in the chemical literature as “The Beirut Reaction”. This reaction can be described as a very simple method of making hundreds if not thousands of heterocyclic compounds some of which have antibacterial activities and anticancer properties. The latter are exemplified by the trade names of Carbadox and Mecadox which were marketed by the drug company: Chas. Pfizer. One compound that has been made by the Beirut Reaction is TPZ (3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazene 1,4-dioxide) which is currently in the third stage of clinical testing as an anticancer drug. In addition to the rich chemistry of the Beirut reaction, Professor Haddadin did original work in the areas of Isobenzofuran, Isoindoles, tetrazines, quinolines, furans, pyrroles, cinnolines and indazoles. He has ninety publications in internationally refereed journals, and some 42 patents in 25 countries. He served his alma mater as Vice President for Academic Affairs (12 years), Acting Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences (3.5 years), Chairman of the Chemistry Department (10 years), occasional Acting Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Acting Deputy President and Acting President. He values highly his services during the Lebanese civil strife (1975-1989). In addition to Heterocyclic Chemistry, he loves poetry especially Arabic poetry. Haddadin co-discovered the Davis-Beirut chemical reaction with Mark Kurth and first published about it around 2005. In their seventh paper on the subject, Kurth and Haddadin named it after the universities where they work, University of California, Davis and American University of Beirut."

  "text" : "Maurice Houvion (born 4 July 1934 in Saulcy-sur-Meurthe, Vosges, France) is a French athlete known for the pole vault during the early transitional time of the fiberglass pole. He represented France at the 1964 Olympics. Unfortunately he was injured at the Olympics and was unable to clear a height. He would continue vaulting and coaching, eventually becoming national coach establishing the rich French tradition in the pole vault. His son Philippe Houvion briefly held the world record in the pole vault in 1980. Maurice rose to being a top level pole vaulter in 1955. He was the national champion in 1962 and 1963. He took up coaching first with his 1964 Olympic compatriot Hervé d'Encausse who he coached to a bronze medal in the 1966 European Championships behind two future world record holders. Hervé's son Philippe d'Encausse is the coach of current world record holder Renaud Lavillenie. In the next two years Herve would hold the European record on two occasions. Other success stories included François Tracanelli who held the world junior record and would vault in two Olympics, Patrick Abada who also held the European record and Ferenc Salbert, winner of the 1989 Jeux de la Francophonie. In all his athletes would win 19 French national championships. His greatest success story was Jean Galfione who he coached through his entire career. Galfione won the Olympic gold medal in 1996 and became one of the members of the prestigious Six meters club. Maurice would hold the Masters M35, M40 and M45 world records. During the cold winters, Maurice would practice in a coal mine, 500 meters underground."

Thirty hours after the baby was born, she was treated with intense antiretroviral therapy. When the baby was about 18 months old, the mother did not bring the child in for scheduled examinations for the next five months. When the mother returned with the child, doctors expected to find high levels of HIV, but instead the HIV levels were undetectable. The Mississippi baby was thought to be the only other person, after the \"Berlin patient,\" to have been cured of HIV. As a result, the National Institutes of Health planned to conduct a worldwide study on aggressive antiretroviral treatment of newborn infants of mothers with HIV infections. It was thought that aggressive antiretroviral therapy on newborn infants might be a cure for HIV. On July 10, 2014, however, it was reported that the child was found to be infected with HIV. Whether the worldwide study planned by the National Institutes of Health will be conducted remains uncertain."

During 2012, Michael was staying at Santa Rosa, California to train for upcoming competitions. On one of his training rides, on 30 June, Michael was hit by a car coming around a bend. The then 25-year-old was thrown off his bike and hit the car windshield, breaking his arm and almost killing him. The driver fled the scene but was later caught and was sentenced to 10 years and four months in prison.Meanwhile, Torckler was airlifted to the nearest hospital, where he arrived in critical condition, close to death. Fortunately, Torckler didn't gain brain damage from the accident, but has no recollection of the accident. He was immediately moved to intensive care, where he stayed but was discharged after only 12 days. After returning to New Zealand after only a month after his accident, Michael was back on his bike and starting to train again.After four months, Michael returned to racing at the 2012 Tour of Southland and finished the race in 61st place.Known as 'King of the Comebacks', Michael raced in the Tour of Utah, and even won the King of the Mountains title. In November 2014 Torckler was announced as part of the Team Budget Forklifts line-up for 2015."

  "text" : "Malcolm Andrew Kelland (9 October 1963) is professor of chemistry at University of Stavanger in Norway, known for inventing environmentally friendly chemicals for the oil industry. He studied chemistry at Oxford University from 1983 to 1990 and was awarded a DPhil in Organometallic chemistry. From 1991 to 2000 he worked at Rogalandsforskning, a Norwegian research institute located in Stavanger (established 1973). Since 2000 he has worked at Stavanger College, which since 2004 has been known as the University of Stavanger. His research has resulted in Kinetic Inhibitors. These are chemicals that aim at preventing gas hydrates, which is ice formation in oil pipes, a process that also may clog the pipes and cause damage to personnel. The inventions are called Low Dosage gas Hydrate Inhibitors (LDHI) and cause less pollution than chemicals that have been traditionally used such as methanol and glycol. His inventions are inspired by how fish survive in cold waters, and use degradable components that resemble the protein found in fish. Kelland is registered as inventor of several patents, some owned by oil companies such as Exxon, and in 2011 he co-founded the company Eco Inhibotors. Since 2010 he has been the leader of the «Green Production Chemistry» research project. He has published numerous peer-reviewed journal articles on his research.In 2009 he also published a book entitled Production Chemicals for the Oil and Gas Industry. He has received prizes from the oil industry. In 2012 he was awarded the Lyse Research Award and in 2013 the Sparebank 1 SR-Bank prize for innovations."

  "text" : "Michael Oatley (born 1935) is a former Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) officer, involved in the resolution of \"The Troubles\" in Northern Ireland. He subsequently directed MI6 operations in the Middle East, 1984-88, and in Europe, 1988-91. He was responsible for counter-terrorist operations from 1985-88. Posted to Belfast in March 1973, notionally as Assistant Political Adviser to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw, Oatley soon became convinced of the need to develop dialogue with the leadership of the Provisional IRA with a view to influencing it in the direction of political action. By late 1974, despite the prohibition of any such contacts following the embarrassment of Whitelaw's attempt to negotiate in 1972, he succeeded in establishing three secure lines of potential communication, the most promising of which was via a Catholic businessman from Derry, Brendan Duddy. In a partnership lasting two decades the two men developed a secret back-channel link between the British Government and the IRA leadership which operated sporadically from 1973 until the 1990s. Its first fruit was the IRA's 1975/76 ceasefire. When this ended in response to the resumption of loyalist paramilitary killings the link continued in being without official sanction but was used in ending the first hunger strike at the Maze Prison in 1981. Kept alive by the courage and dedication of Duddy it eventually led in February 1991 to a crucial meeting between Oatley and Martin McGuiness, which helped lead to a resumption of dialogue and to the Northern Ireland peace process, opening the way to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's former Chief of Staff, described the three major times the back-channel was used: the negotiation of the IRA ceasefire in the mid-1970s; during the first IRA hunger strike in 1980; and in the early stages of the peace process in the 1990s. Peter Taylor's book Behind the Mask: The IRA and Sinn Fein, describes Oatley as the most important British agent to have worked in Northern Ireland."

She received her Ph.D. in 1949 from Harvard University and later served on the faculty at the College of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago and at Brandeis University. With Fritz Heider, Simmel co-authored 'An Experimental Study of Apparent Behavior,' which explored the experience of animacy. The study showed that subjects presented with a certain display of inanimate two-dimensional figures are inclined to ascribe intentions to those figures. This result has been taken to establish \"the human instinct for storytelling\" and to serve as important data in the study of theory of mind. In addition to her early work with Heider, Simmel went on to make important contributions in cognitive neuropsychology, for instance in her work on the phenomenon of phantom limb."

From journalism, she moved into a business role during wartime, later advising the British fashion industry and helping to form the London Fashion Group – a forerunner to the British Fashion Council. In 1948, she founded the first fashion course at the Royal College of Art, helping to develop a rigorous academic framework with a strong industry focus. Robert O'Byrne described Garland as among the female pioneers who: \"battled to have fashion design taken more seriously, in particular fighting for academic acknowledgment\". Garland's obituary in The Times noted: \"She was no society featherhead, but a key figure in the history of British fashion journalism, the British fashion industry and the training of fashion designers.\""

In WW2 hewas refused recognition as a conscientious objector, which led in turn to his refusing to submit to a medical examination as an essential preliminary to call-up; for this refusal he was sentenced to three months imprisonment, giving him a life-long concern for prison reform. On release from prison, he was allowed registration as a conscientious objector, and joined the Pacifist Service Unit in Tiger Bay, Cardiff. In 1944 he moved to the settlement Oxford House, Bethnal Green, joining fellow conscientious objectors Guy Clutton-Brock, John Raven and Peter Kuenstler. In 1954, he opened Norman House as a halfway home for people leaving prison. He appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 30 July 1962."

  "text" : "Holly Lynn Bobo (born October 12, 1990 – 2011) was an American woman who disappeared on April 13, 2011, from her family home in Darden, Tennessee. She was last seen alive by her brother shortly before 8 a.m. walking into the woods outside her home with a man wearing camouflage. In September 2014, her remains were found in northern Decatur County, Tennessee, and her death was ruled a homicide. Six men have been arrested for varying degrees of involvement in the crime. However, only three of the six men arrested have been prosecuted. The prosecution has been heavily criticized for their refusal to produce evidence against the defendants, missing multiple discovery deadlines, and for making frequent changes to the charges against the defendants with little explanation. The men are facing charges of especially aggravated kidnapping, first-degree murder, and rape. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Charges against two of the men were dropped and another named suspect committed suicide without any charges being filed against him. Most of the arrests were made on the basis of a confession by John Dylan Adams, who told police he saw his brother, Zach, and another friend, Jason Autry, with Holly at his brother's home after her kidnapping. It is unknown what led police to question Dylan about Bobo's disappearance. He has since alleged that the confession was coerced. All of the accused men deny involvement in the disappearance and no additional evidence has been released. Defense attorneys for the men complained that they still had yet to receive a bill of particulars detailing the case against their clients and the results of forensic testing done on evidence from the case over a year after the arrests were made. Prosecutors were ordered to turn it over by December 2014. Attorneys for the defendants have filed motions to dismiss charges on the grounds of \"silence or stonewalling\". On June 3, 2015, Judge C. Creed McGinley again issued a deadline, giving them 30 days to turn over the evidence. In July 2015, it was announced that the defendants finally received access to all the evidence against them, although it still has yet to be released to the public. The case has been met with several setbacks such as the death of a suspect, multiple changes to the prosecutorial team, and disputes with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI). The TBI briefly withdrew its services to the entire district after the prosecutor accused the TBI of compromising the case by proceeding \"so slowly that the culprits were always one step ahead and that TBI... was leaking information and possibly covering up evidence.\" District Attorney Matt Stowe said he and the TBI are still \"actively looking\" to bring criminal charges against additional people, although he declined to name the parties or the charges. A tentative trial date has been set for April 3, 2017."

  "text" : "Meta H. Given (January 25, 1888 – November 1981) was an American nutritionist, home economist, and best-selling cookbook author. Given grew up working on her family's farm in Missouri. There, little variety in foodstuffs were available, and after studying nutrition as an undergraduate at the University of Missouri and in graduate school at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the University of Chicago, Given grew interested in devising recipes that maximized the culinary and gustatory value of farm staples but minimized the cost to the consumer. Her best-selling The Modern Family Cookbook was first published in 1942; the Encyclopedia of Modern Cooking was published in two volumes in 1947. Both were revised and reprinted in succeeding decades and followed during the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s by other volumes about food and cooking. Given taught home economics for many years. She recommended that Americans help themselves each day to ten different categories of foodstuffs to ensure adequate nutrition: 1) milk; 2) meat (or cheese for those who don't eat meat); 3) green or yellow vegetable; 4) another vegetable; 5) potato (once a week pasta or rice can take the place but increase vegetable); 6) egg; 7) butter; 8) whole grain; 9) citrus fruit or tomato; and 10) another fruit. Meta Given died in Lakeland, Polk County, Florida, in November 1981."

  "text" : "Marcel Hillaire (April 23, 1908 – January 1, 1988), born Erwin Ottmar Hiller, was a German-born character actor who had a lengthy career, appearing on stage, in films and on television. Hillaire was recognizable by his gaunt appearance and his accent, which seemed to be a combination of French and German. Of Jewish descent, Hillaire first evaded the Holocaust in Nazi Germany by adopting a stage name and moving around constantly in traveling theater troupes; later he brazenly entered the bureaucracy of the Todt under his birth name, narrowly avoiding execution after capture. After World War II, Hillaire emigrated to America, again changed his name, and adopted a French persona, even touring the United States in a one-man stage show dedicated to celebrating French culture. In the early days of American television Hillaire guest starred in over a hundred episodes of various series, usually playing a Frenchman. In American films, Hillaire played the French chef training Audrey Hepburn's eponymous Sabrina and was featured as Fritz the director in Woody Allen's mockumentary Take the Money and Run."

  "text" : "Margie Pitts Hames (December 8, 1933 – July 19, 1994) was an Atlanta civil rights lawyer who argued the abortion rights case Doe v. Bolton before the U.S. Supreme Court. Hames was born in Milton, Tennessee to a poor rural family. As a schoolgirl, Hames encountered a schoolteacher who stated that the only acceptable time for an abortion was “when a black man raped a white woman.\" In 1951, Hames graduated from Kittrell High School in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. While working as a legal secretary, Hames began studying law at Middle Tennessee State University. She later transferred to Vanderbilt University, where she earned bachelor's and law degrees in 1961. In 1962, Hames entered law practice in Atlanta with the law firm of Fisher & Phillips, specializing in labor-management relations. In 1969, after the birth of her two children, Hames started volunteer work for the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. The Ford Foundation had funded this project with the goal of preventing confrontations between civil rights demonstrators and law enforcement. In 1970. the American Civil Liberties Union and the Georgia Legal Aid Society hired Hames to contest a 1968 abortion law in Georgia. The plaintiff \"Doe\" was Sandra Bensing Cano, a woman with an unwanted pregnancy who had been unable to get a legal abortion. The defendant was the Georgia attorney general, Arthur Bolton. Hames was the main lawyer in Doe vs Bolton when it came before the US Supreme Court along with Roe vs. Wade. On January 22, 1973, the court overturned the Georgia law. In 1971, Hames opened her own law firm. She would eventually served as legal counsel for the Atlanta Surgi Center, the Hillcrest Clinic, the Summit Medical Center, Midtown Hospital, and the Atlanta Center for Reproductive Health. She also handled civil rights claims regarding police brutality, employment discrimination, welfare rights and education cases. In 1982, she ran unsuccessfully for the Georgia Supreme Court. In 1994, Hames died at age 60 at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta after suffering a heart attack while driving. She is buried in Milton Cemetery in Milton, Tennessee."

  "text" : "Mabel Fonseca Ramírez (born May 8, 1972 in Guantánamo, Cuba) is a retired amateur Puerto Rican freestyle wrestler, who competed in the women's lightweight category. She produced a remarkable tally of four career medals; three of them were bronze from the Pan American Games (2003 and 2007) and World Championships and a silver in the 59-kg division from the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games. Fonseca also had an opportunity to represent Puerto Rico at the 2004 Summer Olympics, but her participation had been marred by a disqualification for failing the doping test. Throughout her sporting career, Fonseca trained as a member of the women's wrestling team for Esporto San Juan under her personal coach Reinaldo Jimenez. Fonseca highlighted her wrestling career at the 2002 World Wrestling Championships in Chalcis, Greece, where she picked up a bronze medal in the 59-kg division over France's Sandrine Seve, and then boasted for another one at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. When women's wrestling made its debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Fonseca qualified as a lone wrestler for the Puerto Rican squad in the 55 kg class. Earlier in the process, she chose to drop down her weight class by four kilograms and thereby placed fifth from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States. In the prelim pool, Fonseca pinned Ukraine's Tetyana Lazareva in her opening match, but fell behind Sweden's Ida-Theres Karlsson with a similar disposition before reaching the minute mark. Despite missing a spot for the semifinals, Fonseca had a chance to edge past U.S. wrestler Tela O'Donnell 10–7, and China's Sun Dongmei 8–6 in overtime during the classification rounds. Fonseca originally claimed the fifth position, but was disqualified from the tournament after being tested positive for stanozolol, allowing other wrestlers behind her to upgrade their rankings. Upon lifting her two-year suspension from anti-doping violation, Fonseca returned to the wrestling scene, and captured two more medals in the lightweight category at the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games in Cartagena, Colombia, and at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She also vowed to improve her gaming strategy and sought to compete for the 2008 Summer Olympics, but missed a spot from the Olympic Qualification Tournament."

Throughout his sporting career, Semenov trained full-time for Torpedo Wrestling Club in Moscow, under his personal coach and mentor Rerik Sadikhanov. Semenov qualified for the Russian squad in the men's 66 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens by filling up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling and the Russian Olympic Committee through a reallocation process. He lost his opening match to Armenia's Vaghinak Galstyan by a 2–2 draw, but bounced back to defeat Sweden's Jimmy Samuelsson with a solid 3–1 decision, placing second in the prelim pool round and did not advance to the quarterfinals. Semenov originally claimed the eleventh position in the final standings, but two wrestlers were both disqualified by a forfeit in a playoff, upgrading him to ninth."

  "text" : "Mohammad Reza Babulfath (born November 17, 1978 in Tehran, Iran) is a retired amateur Swedish Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's middleweight category. Babulfath obtained a fourth position in the 74-kg division at the 2003 European Championships in Riga, Latvia, and also represented his naturalized homeland Sweden at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Before his sporting career ended in 2008, Babulfath trained for Spårvägens Sports Club (Swedish: Spårvägens Idrottsällskap) in Stockholm, under Polish-born personal coach Ryszard Swierad. Babulfath qualified for his naturalized Swedish squad in the men's 74 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, he placed third from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro to guarantee a spot on Sweden's Olympic wrestling team. He lost his opening match 4–0 to Germany's Konstantin Schneider and endured a daunting 9–0 defeat from eventual Olympic bronze medalist Varteres Samurgashev of Russia, that left him severely injured and unable to compete against Ukraine's Volodymyr Shatskykh on his final bout of the prelim pool. Placing him at the bottom of the pool and last out of 20 wrestlers in the final standings, Babulfath failed to advance to the quarterfinals. Babulfath also sought to compete on his second bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics, but missed a spot from the Olympic Qualification Tournament and suddenly retired from his sporting career. Currently, he serves as an assistant coach for IK Sparta in Stockholm and trains for numerous Swedish wrestlers, including fellow Olympian Ara Abrahamian."

Although the jury in her first trial was unable to reach agreement, Avila was convicted after a second trial at Orange County Supreme Court and was sentenced to three years in San Quentin State Prison. She died there of pneumonia in September 1891 after serving two years and seven months of her sentence. Today Avila is considered to be a folk heroine of Latino people of the county, and is suggested as the \"White Lady\", a ghost said to haunt the area, reported to have been seen walking along the railroad tracks since the 1930s."

  "text" : "The Master of Pratovecchio (active between about 1435 and 1455) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance, named by Roberto Longhi in a 1952 article on the basis of stylistic similarities of a number of works to an altarpiece painted for the monastery of San Giovanni Evangelista in Pratovecchio. The centre panel of the triptych, depicting the Assumption of the Virgin is currently on deposit in Arrezo; the left and right side-panels are in the National Gallery, London. Other works attributed to the artist include Three Archangels in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, a Madonna and Child in the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts, another Madonna and Child in the Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan and a Madonna with six angels, in the Pierpont Morgan Library & Museum, New York. The Master's works are considered to be strongly influenced by the painters Domenico Veneziano and Andrea del Castagno, but also the sculptor Donatello. In 1974 a painting then in the Getty collection attributed to the Master of Pratovecchio (subsequently sold in 2011), depicting a Madonna and Child with Saint Bridget and the Archangel Michael, was linked by Burton B. Fredricksen to a painting similarly to have included the Archangel Michael and Saint Bridget, commissioned in 1439 for the Bridgetine convent at Pian di Ripoli, for which payment was made to a Giovanni di Francesco del Cervelliera da Rovezzano. However, due to marked differences in style between the works attributed to the Master of Pratovecchio and those attributed for Giovanni di Francesco later in the 1450s, it has been suggested that despite the payment, the work was not created by Giovanni di Francesco, but only later, by another. Another name, suggested by Padoa Rizzo in 1993, is Jacopo di Antonio (1427 - 1454), a cousin of Giovanni di Francesco. However, the only work previously associated with him is of a different style again, attributed by some instead to Pesellino or a close follower. Writing in 2005 Andrea De Marchi therefore considered the identifications so far presented to be \"not at all satisfactory\"."

  "text" : "Melvin Ainscow CBE FRSA (born 25 May 1943) is Professor of Education at the University of Manchester. He is also Adjunct Professor at Queensland University of Technology, Australia. He was educated at Ducie High School, the University of Birmingham (MEd), and the University of East Anglia (PhD, 1995). He worked as a Lecturer at the University of Cambridge from 1985 to 1995, before being appointed Professor of Education at Manchester in 1995. At Manchester he is also co-director of the Centre for Equity in Education. In 2013 he was appointed a specialist adviser to the House of Commons Education Committee. Professor Ainscow specializes in the areas of equity, inclusion and school improvement. Between 2007 and 2011 he led the Greater Manchester Challenge a project that involved a partnership between national government, ten local authorities, 1,150 schools and many other stakeholders, and had a government investment of around £50 million. The decision to invest such a large budget reflected a concern regarding educational standards in the region, particularly amongst children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The approach used in the Challenge built on earlier research carried out by Ainscow and his colleagues at the University of Manchester which suggests that, under appropriate conditions, greater collaboration within schools is a means of fostering improvements; and that collaboration between differently-performing schools can reduce polarization within education systems, to the particular benefit of learners who are performing relatively poorly. The impact of all of this was significant in respect to improvements in test and examination results and, indeed, the way the education system carries out its business. Currently Mel Ainscow is leading Schools Challenge Cymru, the Welsh Government’s multi-million pound flagship programme to accelerate the rate of improvement across the country’s schools. His new book, ‘Towards self-improving school systems: lessons from a city challenge’, was published by Routledge in April 2015. Another book, 'Struggles for equity in education: The selected works of Mel Ainscow', will be published in the Routledge World Library of Educationalists series in July, 2015. He was made a CBE in the 2012 New Year Honours, and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts."

Hinz also starred in numerous films, such as The Longest Day (in which he played Manfred Rommel, the son of his father's character Erwin Rommel), television series, and was the voice actor for Jeff Goldblum in The Ray Bradbury Theater and Scott Wilson in the 1967 film In Cold Blood. He is best remembered for playing Uncle Quentin in the British television series adaptation of Enid Blyton's The Famous Five in the late 1970s. Hinz's first wife was the actress Ingrid van Bergen, with whom he had his first daughter Carolin van Bergen, who later also became an actress. In 1967, he met the actress Viktoria Brams. They were married from 1968 until Hinz's death in 2008.

His works are characterized by an enameled, metallic finish and a decorative, linear Florentine School style. There is now approximately thirty paintings that have been attributed to him. He is known to have worked in and around Lucca. Apparent influences include Domenico Ghirlandaio and Filippino Lippi. The parish church of Santa Maria Assunta houses a fifteenth-century altarpiece painted by Michelangelo di Pietro."

Dasgupta has made key contributions in developing theoretical models to quantum tunnelling of composite objects, and has also designed efficient experimental particle detection equipment. Her current work aims to understand the quantum interactions of stable and unstable exotic nuclei, underpinning opportunities with next generation accelerators. Dasgupta's work is also advancing understanding on the transition from quantum to classical behaviour, which is important for the development of nanoscale technologies. In 1992, Dasgupta completed her PhD at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, India. Shortly after, she moved to Australia, and in 1998 was awarded a Queen Elizabeth II Fellowship by the Australian Research Council. In 2003, she became the first woman appointed to a tenured position in the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the Australian National University, and in 2004 she undertook a nationwide lecture tour as the 2004 Australian Institute of Physics (AIP) \"Women in Physics\" lecturer. In 2006, she was awarded the prestigious Pawsey medal from the Australian Academy of Science, which honours outstanding research in physics in Australia by a scientist under the age of 40. Dasgupta was elected a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 2011, and that same year was awarded the inaugural Georgina Sweet Australian Laureate Fellowship from the Australian Academy of Science. The fellowship funded Dasgupta in her efforts to increase the profile of women in science and work towards advancing early career researchers as well as facilitate leadership pathways for senior women researchers. She is also currently a member of the National Committee for Physics. That year she also represented the Group of Eight universities at the Women in Science and Engineering summit at Parliament House. Dasgupta has published more than 80 papers in journals such as Nature, Physics Letters and Physical Review C."

  "text" : "Mary Ann Augustin  FTSE is an Australian food chemist and dairy scientist who leads the Food Science Research Program at CSIRO. Much of her work has focused on understanding the changes that occur during dairy milk processing and the effect these changes exhibit on the proteins and minerals of milk, which are collectively referred to as \"milk functionality\". Dr. Augustin researches emerging food processing technologies and approaches to food processing for dairy and milk products, fish oils and probiotics. She leads the research on CSIRO's patented microencapsulation system, a high-tech ingredient-delivery technology. Her research on the chemistry of milk modifications has led to the development of specialised milk powders that improve the performance of liquid milk products as food ingredients. The most extensively used of Dr Augustin's innovations is a technology that allows milk powder manufacturers to guarantee that their product will be stable during subsequent processing in the manufacture of recombined products. Notably, she was also the driving force behind the research that produced calcium-enriched milk, enabling adults to ingest their recommended daily calcium intake from fewer than two glasses of the fortified milk. Augustin graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree with First Class Honours from Monash University, where she was also awarded her PhD. In 1988, she joined CSIRO laboratories and is now heads the Food Science Research Program at CSIRO Food and Nutritional Services. She was appointed as a Professional Fellow in the School of Chemistry at Monash University in 2005 as part of a special collaboration between CSIRO and Monash University. She is a member of the Australian Academy of Science, serves on the Research Advisory Committee for the Malaysian Palm Oil Board in China and in 2008 was elected to The Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE)."

Dr Friedel's research has made an outstanding contribution to better understanding the Australian rangelands from social, ecological and production perspectives, and the human-environment nexus in arid and semi-arid lands. Her research work has included collaborative scenario making to test regional development options for arid land communities, mainly in the Northern Territory. She is also well known for her research into the sustainable management of buffell grass – a species useful for pastoral meat production but disadvantageous ecologically as it is invasive and out-competes native grasses.

In 1870, she became the first female university student in Finland at the University of Helsinki. Women were not allowed to study there, but she was given special dispensation to do so, and thus became the first woman in the Nordic countries to do so: though women in Sweden was given the right to attend university the same year, the first woman, Betty Pettersson, did not enlist at university until the year after. Maria Tschetschulin was the first female to study at university, but she discontinued her studies in 1873 without taking her exam, and the first female graduate was Emma Irene Åström in 1882; she described herself as an anti-feminist, and did not wish to attend lectures in the company of only men.

  "text" : "Mieczyslaw Rys-Trojanowski (born October 21, 1881 in Krośniewice, murdered April 4, 1945 in Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp) was a General brygady of Polish Army in the Second Polish Republic. Rys-Trojanowski was born in a patriotic Polish family: his father Szymon fought in the January Uprising. After high school, Mieczyslaw went to Krakow, to study at Jagiellonian University. There he got in touch with patriotic organizations, which fought for the independence of the nation (see Partitions of Poland). Rys-Trojanowski participated in the Revolution of 1905, during which he was arrested on suspicion of attempting to kill Russian governor of Warsaw (see Congress Poland). In 1908 he moved to Austrian Galicia, where he became one of key members of the Union of Active Struggle, and organizer of local branches of the Riflemen's Association. Promoted to the rank of officer, Rys-Trojanowski fought in the Polish Legions in World War I, participating in all major battles of the unit, including the Battle of Kostiuchnowka. On November 1, 1916, he was named commandant of the 5th Legions' Infantry Regiment. In July 1917, after the so-called Oath Crisis, Rys-Trojanowski was imprisoned in Beniaminow. Later, he was kept in German camps at Rastatt, Holzminden and Werl. In early November 1918, Rys-Trojanowski became commandant of Chelm Military District and Chelm Infantry Regiment (later renamed into 35th Infantry Regiment), with which he fought in the Polish-Soviet War. On May 20, 1920, Rys-Trojanowski was transferred to the 17th Infantry Brigade, and on September 2 of that year he was named commandant of the 9th Infantry Division, remaining in this post until late July 1926. On December 1, 1924, President Stanislaw Wojciechowski upon request of Minister of Military Affairs Wladyslaw Sikorski, promoted Rys-Trojanowski to the rank of General brygady. On July 31, 1926, President Ignacy Moscicki named Rys-Trojanowski commandant of Military District Nr 9 in Brzesc nad Bugiem. In 1935, he was transferred to Warsaw, becoming commandant of Military District Nr 1. Rys-Trojanowski remained in this post until the Invasion of Poland (September 1, 1939). On September 4 he left Polish capital, tasked with creation of Prusy Army. Due to rapid German advance, this army was not created: Rys-Trojanowski involved himself with creation of Warszawa Army. He personally visited checkpoints on roads east of Warsaw, controlling the evacuation of civil servants, police officers and army personnel. In mid-September, he helped with creation of Lublin Army, gathering soldiers scattered in northern Lesser Poland, Podlasie and eastern Mazovia. On September 20, after Soviet invasion of Poland, Rys-Trojanowski fled to Hungary, where he remained until March 1944. He was a very active member of Polish organizations in Hungary, cooperating both with Home Army and Hungarian headquarters. On March 19, 1944, upon the invasion and occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany, Rys-Trojanowski was arrested and sent to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. He was murdered there on April 4, 1945."

She became acquainted with the author Alan Paton, and read his novel Cry, the beloved country (1948), whose main theme was racial discrimination in South Africa. This affected her greatly, and she became a campaigner for the rights of black people there. She worked with Michael Scott, (who, in 1946, was the first white man to be jailed for resisting South Africa's racial laws), and helped to found the African Bureau. She testified to the United Nations Committee on Apartheid in 1963, and was the first South African to do so. She was placed under house arrest and \"banned\" in 1966. She subsequently left the country and lived in exile. She appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 16 February 1997. She died in 2000. Her papers, including correspondence with Semane Molotlegi and those relating to her biography of Tshekedi Khama, are archived in the Bodleian Library of Commonwealth and African Studies at Oxford. Other papers, including material relating to her biography of Nelson Mandela and correspondence with fellow anti-apartheid activists, forms part of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies archive collections held at Senate House Library."

  "text" : "Dr. Mary Lee Edward (1885–1980) was a pioneer amongst women in medicine and a recognized hero in the First World War. She was the first female medical graduate of the University of Toronto in 1908. Ms Edward was born in Petrolia, Ontario, Canada, the daughter of Alexander Clark Edward and Jennie Gertrude Dawson. Interested in research, she moved to the New York Infirmary for Women and Children in New York City where she was awarded a scholarship to study surgery for a year in Vienna. On her return she was appointed chief resident surgeon at the Infirmary. In 1917 she volunteered for overseas service and joined the Women's Overseas Hospitals, an institution which she helped organize, supported by the National Suffrage Associations. Arriving in France on February 18, 1918, and as part of the Tenth Army, she was sent to the Chateau Ognon at Senlis on the front. There, during the great German offensive in the spring and summer, she operated on over 100 casualties in a 24-hour period, and as long as 60 hours at a stretch under enemy fire. For this, she was awarded the Croix de Guerre for her outstanding bravery and for her record of valour while under the direction of the French government. A true medical pioneer, Dr. Edward continued her practice in New York City after the war until her 85th birthday. A plaque is erected in her honour at the Assiginack Museum in Manitowaning, Ontario, near the Edwards family cottage. Much of the information above is excerpted or adapted from that plaque."

Just days before her 45th birthday, October 21, 1979 she won the masters division of the New York Marathon in 2:54:58 on what was later judged to be a short course. In January 1980, she won the Monza Marathon for the second time in 2:54:31. She had also won in 1978 in a comparable 2:54:16. She took on a full schedule at the European Veterans Championships in Helsinki, winning the 1500 metres, the 5000 metres and the Marathon in 3:02:00. On October 12, 1980 she won the Italian National Championship (open division) in Rieti the first time the championship was offered for women in 2:49:22.4. In early 1981, she went to Christchurch, New Zealand, where she dominated the WAVA Championships taking home gold in the W45 1500 metres, 5000 metres and the cross country event. The 18:09.03 in the 5000 m was a W45 world record. It lasted as the Italian masters record until 2009. September 13, 1981 she improved her marathon time to 2:48:46 in Agen, France. Then on May 9, 1982 she improved her time again to 2:46:13 for the W45 world record in Verona."

  "text" : "Maxine Drinkwater (born May 19, 1936 as Maxine Simmons) played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. She both batted and threw right-handed and played in first base and second base. Her nickname was Max. Max spent her childhood years in Camden and, during that time, her summers playing baseball with her brothers and other kids from the neighborhood. Clearly playing baseball came naturally to her. She said: “I didn’t have to learn how to play. I just knew. We had a good group of neighborhood kids and I lived right near the field.” As a player in 1954 for the South Bend Blue Sox, she earned a place in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Maxine played in 45 of the team’s 111 games, making her one of the league’s top fielding second basemen, boasting a .947 fielding percentage. With offensive however, she only batted .147. One of her claims to fame was that she was the first player chosen at the tryouts for the league. A year later however, the team folded. At 69 years old, on July 31, 2005, Maxine was amongst 11 individuals inducted in various ceremonies that took place at a Portland hotel. On being the first woman to be inducted into the hall of fame, Maxine was reported to have said, “I think it’s pretty good. It’s been a long time coming.”"

In 1975, he put a beehive on his roof in Chicago and was surprised at the amount of honey his urban beekeeping produced. In the summer of 2004, Thompson worked with two other beekeepers to start the Chicago Honey Co-op, which is dedicated to provide healthy food, passing down bee-keeping knowledge, and employing the formerly incarcerated. On January 2013, Thompson held his first urban beekeeping class that was open to the public at the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum."

  "text" : "Michelle Drouin is an American researcher who focuses on psychological issues dealing with social media and communications technology. She has studied deception during sexting, and how texting and sexting affect attachment in relationships between college students, as well as between adult relationships. She found correlations between coercive sexting and mental health problems as well as links between Internet trolling and sadism. She described how people sometimes use social media to maintain back-burner relationships to keep alive connections to possible future romantic partners. Much of her research focuses on social media sites such as Facebook; for example, she found that some people make new romantic connections by friending people on Facebook. She studied the issue of phantom vibrations experienced by many cell phone users in which a phone seems to vibrate but doesn't; a study she conducted found that 89% of students experienced a phantom vibration at least once every two weeks. She found that people were more likely to experience phantom vibrations if they expected to react emotionally to incoming communications. Her research found that young adults generally do not support the practice of employers using social media when making hiring decisions. Drouin is associate professor of psychology at Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne."

  "text" : "Martin Hewitt (born 16 November 1980 in Widnes, Cheshire) is a mountaineer, businessman and former Captain in the Parachute Regiment. He is most notable for his attempts to be the first to complete the Explorers Grand Slam with a team of disabled mountaineers. He is also known for his appearances on the BBC TV programme Harry's Arctic Heroes. Hewitt spent eight years as a commissioned officer in the Parachute Regiment. He was mentioned in dispatches in 2006 during his first tour of Afghanistan. Whilst leading a Platoon attack in Helmand Province, Afghanistan in 2007 on his second tour of duty he received gunshot wounds to the chest and foot from a 7.62 calibre machine-gun fired by insurgents. This resulted in his right-arm becoming permanently paralysed. Forced to quit active service with the British Army, Hewitt turned his mind to disabled sport and mountaineering. After forming and captaining the first Combined Services Disabled Ski Team, he went on to represent Great Britain in the Paralympic World Championships competing in Downhill Ski Racing. In 2011 he walked unsupported to the Geographic North Pole joined by HRH Prince Harry as part of the Walking With The Wounded team. In 2012 he summited Mount McKinley (Denali) in Alaska. Later that year he made his first attempt at climbing Mount Everest, again as part of the Walking With The Wounded team. Unfortunately treacherous conditions forced the team to abandon their attempt before reaching the summit. Hewitt is currently leading the Adaptive Grand Slam team on its attempt to be the first disabled team to reach the North and South Poles and to scale the highest mountain on all seven continents. As of November 2014, The North Pole, Mt McKinley (North America) and Mt Elbrus (Europe) had been summited and the team were currently in Tanzania in preparation to ascend Mt Kilimanjaro (Africa). 2016 is the target date for completion of the Adaptive Grand Slam. Hewitt also runs a business providing leadership and teamwork training and consultancy to organisations and sports teams."

  "text" : "Mildred Jordan (March 18, 1901 – October 23, 1982) was an American author and playwright. Born in Chicago, she worked at the Hull House before relocating to Reading, Pennsylvania after her marriage. Her first novel, One Red Rose Forever, which was based on the history of Lancaster County, was rejected by twenty-two publishers before finally appearing in 1941. Her subsequent books often focused on the lives of Pennsylvania Dutch immigrants to America. Public reaction to Jordan's work was mixed. While a 1954 review of her play The Wonderful Cornelia referred to her as \"one of the nation's best-known novelists\", John Updike expressed a more ambivalent view of her talents several years later, dismissing her in a sentence as \"an unmeetably rich industrialist's wife\". In addition to her own writing, Jordan also served as the editor of the Berks County Historical Magazine. She received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Albright College in 1979. Jordan was represented by the literary agent Annie Laurie Williams, whose other clients included Margaret Mitchell, John Steinbeck, and Truman Capote."

In 1865 Maxwell was joined in the practice by Charles Tuke, who became a partner two years later. The practice moved its main office to Manchester in 1884. Frank, son of James Maxwell, joined the practice in the later 1880s and became a partner. The two senior partners both died in 1893, and Frank Maxwell continued the practice, maintaining its name as Maxwell and Tuke. In the early years the practice designed relatively small buildings in and around Bury. Their first major commission came in 1871 for Cambridge Hall, Southport. Later works included the Ulster Reform Club in Belfast, and extensive temporary structures to house the Royal Jubilee Exhibition in Manchester in 1887/1888. After this they had their most notable commission, the design of Blackpool Tower. Both senior partners died before this could be completed, and the work was continued by Frank Maxwell. The commercial success of Blackpool Tower led to a commission to design the even larger New Brighton Tower. The practice continued to design notable buildings into the 20th century."

From the 1960s on, he combined the role of couturier with consultancy to mainstream fashion houses, most notably acting as a key consultant to Marks & Spencer. His obituary of 1985 in The Times described his label as \"the last great English tailoring house\", saying also that Donnellan's death: \"marks the end of an era\".

  "text" : "Michael Katakis FRGS (born 1952), is a writer, photographer, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and manager of Ernest Hemingway's literary estate. His photographs are represented in many institutions including the National Portrait Gallery (United States). Katakis was born in Chicago, Illinois, an only child. His father emigrated from Greece shortly after World War II. His mother, who was the daughter of Greek immigrants, died when he was a boy. Katakis began writing about 1975. He later started taking photographs and has always considered himself \"a writer who happens to take pictures.\" He travelled extensively throughout the world, making contact with a wide range of cultures and geographic locations. He visited many countries including China, West Africa, Cuba, Hungary, Morocco, Turkey, the United States, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, Italy, Greece, England, France and Spain. During this time he married Kris L. Hardin, an anthropologist, and they spent 25 years travelling together, collaborating on many projects and producing exhibitions and books derived from their work. In 2009 Michael Katakis and Kris L. Hardin donated thousands of pages and photographs of their work to the British Library. The couple gave interviews, which were placed in the Oral History section of the library. In 2011 an exhibition, 'Michael Katakis Photographs', was held in the Folio Gallery of the library to coincide with the publication of \"Photographs and Words,\" authored by Katakis and Hardin. The book featured photographs from the projects 'The Vietnam Veterans Memorial', 'Troubled Land: 12 Days Across America' (a portrait of the US in the days after the September 11 attacks) and 'A Time and Place Before War', which documented life in Sierra Leone before the outbreak of civil war in 1991). Details of these projects and the time spent in Sierra Leone by Katakis and Hardin, were covered in the interviews. In 1999 Katakis was working with Ernest Hemingway's second son, Patrick Hemingway, on a collection of essays, when Katakis accepted an offer by Hemingway to manage Ernest Hemingway's literary estate. The work of Michael Kataris has been translated into several languages including Greek, Bulgarian and Chinese and his photographs have been collected by institutions including the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C., the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Library and Stanford University's Special Collections Department.

Prior to starting the radio show, the Housewives League had its share of scandal due to conflicts of interest arising from endorsements of food manufacturers who also advertised heavily in the league's publications. Earlier in life, Heath also did some work with Jacob Riis at the Flower Mission and Riis Settlement House. Heath was born in Stonington, Connecticut, and died at her home in Douglaston, Queens in 1932, survived by her son Julian D. Heath, and was buried at Kensico Cemetery."

  "text" : "Muriel Petioni (1914-2011) was a doctor and community activist in Harlem. She was born in Trindad, but her father was exiled to Harlem in 1917 due to his opposition to the colonial government, and in 1919 the rest of his family joined him. Her father eventually became a doctor at the age of 40. In 1937 Muriel graduated from Howard University Medical School, where she was the only woman in her class. After taking a few years off when her son was born in 1947, she started her practice again on the ground floor of her home, which was also where her father had his practice. She was among the first generation of black doctors given staff privileges at Harlem Hospital in the 1950s. In addition to her private practice, she worked as school physician in Central Harlem for the New York City health department from 1950 to 1980, was supervising physician for Central and East Harlem from 1980 to 1984, and was a founder or leader of many community organizations in Harlem, including founding the Friends of Harlem Hospital. She also founded the Susan Smith McKinney Steward Medical Society for Women in 1974 (a professional association for African American women doctors in the Greater New York area), and was the founder and first chair of Medical Women of the National Medical Association, founded in 1976, which became the Council of Women’s Concerns of the National Medical Association. Working with the Coalition of 100 Black Women, she also developed a mentorship program to guide young African American women into careers in science and medicine. She was also a president of the Society of Black Women Physicians. Her awards include the Howard University College of Medicine Outstanding Alumni Award, given in 1992, and the 1999 Frederick Douglass Award, bestowed by Douglass's great-great granddaughter, which was the highest honor of the New York Urban League. In 2002 she shared the City College of New York's Generations Public Service Recognition Award with her son. In 2007 she was awarded a Barnard College Medal of Distinction. Petioni's obituary was included in The Socialite who Killed a Nazi with Her Bare Hands: And 144 Other Fascinating People who Died this Year, a collection of New York Times obituaries published in 2012."

  "text" : "Marcus Henry Milner (16 April 1864 – 16 January 1939) was an English racehorse trainer, soldier and civil servant and a cricketer who played two first-class cricket matches for Cambridge University in 1884. He was born at West Retford, Nottinghamshire and died at Liverpool. Milner was educated at Wellington College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Having captained Wellington as a left-handed opening batsman and a left-arm medium-pace bowler, he appeared as a lower-order batsman and bowler in his two Cambridge matches; he took five wickets and scored 20 and 4 in the first game against an invitational amateur side, but was not successful in the second, and did not appear again. Milner had a varied career after leaving Cambridge. In 1888, he married the Dowager Duchess of Montrose, 46 years his senior and, through her second marriage after the death of the Duke, an established breeder and trainer of racehorses, though forced by the conventions of the time to use a male pseudonym, Mr Manton, for the business; for some time after the marriage, the horses ran under Milner's name, though the whole business had been sold in the months before the Duchess's death in 1894. According to his own short obituary in The Times, Milner acted as \"controller\" to successive generations of the Stanley family, the Earls of Derby. He was also a decorated soldier, serving with the Imperial Yeomanry in the Second Boer War in which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and then as a major in the First World War, when he was aide-de-camp to the commanding officer of the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division and was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre. He also served briefly as a civil servant: he was assistant private secretary to the Under-Secretary for War in 1902 and private secretary from 1905 to 1906. \n* A Caricature of Milner from an 1890 edition of Vanity Fair"

  "text" : "General Mordaunt Cracherode (died 20 June 1773 - or in 1768 by some accounts) was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Fort St. Philip, Minorca, in 1753 and as a lieutenant-colonel was commanding officer of the marines during George Anson's voyage round the world. His son, Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode, was an important benefactor to the British Museum. Despite leaving them his large collections of books, prints and other artworks, his home-made will left his sister Ann his land and residual fortune; she was then 79, and without children or close relations. Clayton's friend, Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham descended upon her, and after exercising what many later felt was undue influence, persuaded her to make a new will, in which he was named sole executor, with wide power over the disposition of the funds. After bequests, some £30,000 was left for the executor to spend on \"such objects of benevolence and liberality as the trustee in his own discretion shall most approve of\" - perhaps equating to £2.1 million in modern terms. After Ann died in 1802 the will generated Morice v Bishop of Durham in 1805, an important English trusts law case concerning the beneficiary principle; the trust was held to be invalid."

  "text" : "Maccheroni alla molinara [makkeˈroːni ˈalla moliˈnaːra] or alla mugnaia [ˈalla muɲˈɲaːja] (Abruzzese dialect) is an uneven, long and thick fresh pasta that is hand-pulled to a diameter of about 4–6 mm. It is made using only water, durum wheat flour. The name literally translates to \"the miller’s wife’s pasta\". The pasta is characteristic of the province of Teramo and Pescara in the Abruzzo, Italy. These are manufactured by working the dough until it gets a hole in its center. The process requires trained hands that, facing one another, are able to slip into the hole to knead the dough in a circle, and gradually lengthening the ring to get a long noodle. This is then cut to length, generally about twice as long as a normal spaghetti, or served as one giant noodle loop with up to 10 meters in length. This pasta remains relatively unknown since it is typically served only in homes and at festivals, and it represents a dying trait even in Abruzzo. The history of this pasta dates back to the 14th century coinciding with the construction of watermills on the river Fino. Back then it was presented to King Robert of Naples when he visited the area."

  "text" : "Michael Balfour (11 February 1918 – 24 October 1997) was an English actor, working mainly in British films and TV, following his TV debut in the BBC's The Marvellous History of St Bernard, in 1938. He was a recognisable face, often in small character parts and supporting roles, in nearly two hundred films and TV shows, from the 1940s to the 1990s, often playing comical heavies or otherwise shady characters notable for their \"loud\" clothes. Sometimes convincingly cast as an American. He worked for a rollcall of film directors, including Tony Richardson, Pete Walker, Billy Wilder, Lewis Gilbert, Roman Polanski, Leslie Norman, Tim Burton, John Frankenheimer, François Truffaut, John Gilling, Stanley Donen, Ken Annakin, Cavalcanti, Lance Comfort, Terence Young, Gerald Thomas, Pasolini, John Paddy Carstairs, Terence Fisher, Val Guest, Frank Launder, John Huston, Basil Dearden and Howard Hawks. Balfour had parts in many popular TV shows of the era including Danger Man, The Avengers, Hancock's Half Hour, Dixon of Dock Green, Rogue's Gallery, Z-Cars, The Onedin Line, and the detective drama The Vise, playing Saber's assistant Barney O'Keefe. Balfour was also known as a passenger in the car driven by actor Bonar Colleano when it crashed, killing Colleano. Balfour's injuries required him to have 98 stitches, but he was released from hospital in time to attend Colleano's funeral. As his screen career began to slow down in the late 1970s, Michael Balfour went on tour with European circuses, as a clown. He founded Circus Hazzard, and created his own clown character. His son later became a circus manager. As well as performing, Balfour was a dedicated painter and sculptor, and in later years turned increasingly to sculpture and the arts, even running his own gallery for a while. For his subjects, he frequently drew on his own family career as a circus clown. Balfour bore a strong resemblance to American actor Slim Pickens."

In 1990, she graduated from ESAG Penninghen, the Higher College of Graphic Arts, and started exhibiting in Parisian galleries the following year. Immediately afterwards she was commissioned paintings by the Living Museum of the Horse in Chantilly to be permanently displayed in two rooms. At the same time she published a book, Les chevaux d’encre. Many art books would follow including Les chevaux du Sahara in 1998, Les chevaux du vent in 2002 and Les chevaux de rois in 2003. She would be rewarded by Prix Pégase for those last two books which testify to her passion for illustrations of all kind of horses, Arabians being her favorite. In 2014, she illustrated an art book dedicated to classical French riding with texts by Guillaume Henry. A sculptor too, she showed her first bronze casts in 1996. Over time, her work expanded as she explored different medium, creating designs for collections of Gien earthenware called « Horses of the Wind » and « Horses of the Sun » or as a regular contributor for Belin publishing. She mainly works using ink, no models, which enables her to exptas her unique style and artistic freedom. Her works have been exhibited all over the world, especially in Switzerland, England (London), the United States, the United Arab Emirates and China. In 2010 a major retrospective exhibition of her works was held at Saint Jean castle in Nogent-le-Rotrou, now a museum. Art reviewers have often praised the elegance of her stroke, the delicacy, the accuracy of anatomy, the movement and dream like quality expressed in her works."

  "text" : "Marcel Rieder (19 March 1862 – 30 March 1942) was a French painter. He was born in Thann. Rieder came from a distinguished family of Alsace; his grandfather Jean Jacques Rieder (1778–1852) was a minister of the Temple Neuf Protestant church in Strasbourg. Marcel Rieder studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He became a member of the Société des Artistes Français in 1894, and exhibited almost every year until 1939 in the \"Salon de Paris\". Rieder married Marie Poiriault on 25 June 1903. Their son, Jean, was born in August 1906. Rieder's painting style remained realistic throughout his life. He was initially influenced by the Symbolists, as evidenced in his painting Dante pleurant Béatrice (Dante weeping for Beatrice), now in the Musée de Mulhouse. From 1894 his style changed, and Rieder’s paintings became notable for their peaceful and intimate interior scenes of rooms lit by oil lamps or electric lighting. He also painted twilight landscapes. As a member of the Société Bach of Paris Rieder came to know Albert Schweitzer. His portrait of the physician is shown in the museum dedicated to Schweitzer. A painting by Rieder, Jours Heureux, was included in an exhibition staged at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool in the autumn of 1907. It featured in a room highlighting the work of overseas artists and was described by an anonymous columnist in the Manchester Courier as having \"beautiful colour rendering\". Rieder spent most of his life in Paris, but in 1927 he retired to Busseu near Fontainebleau. In later life, Rieder joked that he had gone over to a \"impressionistic\" painting style, due to fading eyesight and tremors in his hands. He died in Villiers-sous-Grez on 30 March 1942. \n* Marcel Rieder's paintings  \n* A vigil by the sea, Côte d'Azur \n* Romantic soirée \n* Choosing jewellery \n* Decorating the Christmas tree \n* Waiting by the window \n* Songeuse devant la cheminée \n* Solitude au bord du lac \n* A revery by the lakeside, Lac d'Annecy"

Her main achievement, begun in collaboration with her father in the early 1970s, intensified during the 1990s, and concluded just weeks before her death, was the preservation of traditional Faroese folk singing, which she presented in a number of large volumes with music notation transcriptions of sound recordings. Based on more than 6,000 such recordings, collected by many different scholars, including herself, throughout the entire 20th century, she published around 3,350 music notation examples of various genres of traditional Faroese singing, together with hitherto unpublished song texts, as well as historical and musicological analyses. Marianne Clausen also led and conducted several amateur choirs, most notably 1978-2000 the Faroese choir in Copenhagen, Húsakórið, and 1984-2013 the Danish choir Con Brio."

  "text" : "The following is a list of the film and television appearances of American actress Marlee Matlin. Matlin, who had previously acted in stage productions, made her screen debut as the female lead in the 1986 film Children of a Lesser God, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award. Matlin, who is deaf, generally plays deaf characters. However, in 1994 Matlin also played a hearing woman when she appeared in the title role of the television movie Against Her Will: The Carrie Buck Story, based on the true story of Carrie Buck, who was not deaf. Matlin was nominated for a CableACE Award for her performance as Carrie Buck. Although Matlin has continued to make occasional film appearances, most of her work has been in television. From 1991 to 1993, she starred in the police drama series Reasonable Doubts as Assistant District Attorney Tess Kaufman, receiving two Golden Globe nominations. She has had recurring roles as Mayor Laurie Bey in Picket Fences (for which she received an Emmy Award nomination), pollster Joey Lucas in The West Wing (appearing on all seven seasons of its run), attorney Ruby Whitlow in My Name Is Earl, gay sculptor Jodi Lerner in The L Word, and guidance counselor Melody Bledsoe in Switched at Birth. Her numerous guest appearances have included Seinfeld, The Practice, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, each of which brought her another Emmy nomination. Matlin has also competed on the game shows Dancing with the Stars and The Celebrity Apprentice. On the April 3, 2011 episode of The Celebrity Apprentice, Matlin raised $986,000 for her charity, the Starkey Hearing Foundation, setting a record for the most funds raised for charity in a single event on any television show. The show's production company then donated an additional $14,000 to bring the contribution to one million dollars."

She completed her secondary education in Kabul, and attended Tehran University for her Master's degree. Following the Russian occupation of Afghanistan in 1979, Mahboob left the country to move first to Pakistan, and then to Delhi, India in 1981. Along with other Afghan expatriates, Mahboob started the journal Gahnama (\"irregular journal\") to express cultural resistance against both the communist government of Afghanistan and the Mujahideen. However, facing pressure from the Mujahideen amongst the Afghan community in India, she migrated once again to move to Canada in 1983. Mahboob produced most of her major fiction works while in diaspora. Her works concentrate on the suppression and marginalization of women, while also expressing a revolt against the social norms and attitudes towards women."

  "text" : "Michael Hayes (3 April 1929 – 16 September 2014) was a British television director and newsreader. He was born in Barking in Essex. As a young man, Hayes was an actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Later he worked for the BBC in various roles, beginning as a studio manager for the World Service, and working his way up to directing for television. Perhaps his most notable work was directing the hugely successful BBC drama adaptations of various Shakespeare plays, collectively entitled An Age of Kings, in 1960. Like many TV drama professionals, after retirement he became better remembered for his work in television science fiction. Amongst Hayes’s many other credits, he directed three Doctor Who serials starring Tom Baker, including 1979’s City of Death, widely considered by fans to be one of the series' best stories. He also helmed the BBC’s 1961 adaptation of A for Andromeda. From 1986 to 1994 he was a newsreader for the World Service. He died in September 2014, at the age of 85."

In the 1890s he applied his method of interference fringes to an analysis of errors made in astronomical observations using meridian circles. He used his interference method to confirm Barnard's measurement of the apparent diameter of Venus. Hamy participated in the creation of l'Institut d'optique théorique et appliquée (SupOptique). He won the prix Lalande in 1895. Filling the empty chair created by the death of Jules Janssen, Hamy was elected in 1908 a member of l'Académie des sciences and then in 1928 its president. He was also elected a member of the Bureau des longitudes. He is a nephew of Ernest Hamy."

  "text" : "Margaret Wagar (April 6, 1902 – January 6, 1990) was an American bridge player from Delaware, Ohio and Atlanta, Georgia. The premier American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) annual championship for women teams since 1976 is the Wagar Women's Knockout Teams, named for Wagar. Previously it was the Women's Board-a-Match Teams, which she won six times including four in a row from 1943 to 1946 with identical teammates Emily Folline, Helen Sobel, and Sally Young. Her teams also finished second or tied for second ten times in 15 years from 1950 to 1964! Wagar also won the premier championship for women pairs four years in a row with Kay Rhodes, the 1955 to 1958 Whitehead Women's Pairs tournaments (and were partners on the runner-up women team seven years in a row from 1952 to 1958). She and Sobel won the Fall National Open Pairs in 1947 and 1948; she and John Crawford won the Rockwell Mixed Pairs in 1948 and 1949. (The Fall National was one of several \"national championships\" for open pairs; the Rockwell was and is the major championship for mixed pairs.) Olive Peterson and Wagar became ACBL Life Masters number 36 and 37 in 1943, the fourth and fifth women to achieve the rank after Sally Young, Helen Sobel, and Peggy Solomon.They had been the two women on the 1942 champion mixed team. Wagar retired from bridge competition in 1978. She had lived in Atlanta most of her life and she was honored by Atlanta bridge players on August 31, 1982. At that time Alan Truscott (New York Times bridge columnist and continuing editor of The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge) credited her with 27 \"national titles\", which he believed to be the greatest number for any living woman. In a column three months after her 1990 death, however, he credited her with 24—with comment only that they included two of \"the prestigious Spingold Knockout Teams\". Wagar was inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 1999. As a competitive bridge player at least during the 1940s she was sometimes covered under the names Mrs. Margaret W. Wagar and Mrs. Wilkinson Wagar of Atlanta. In one 1944 society column of The Atlanta Constitution, \"Margaret (Mrs. Wilkinson) Wagar\" appears in two of the three items."

  "text" : "Mary Jane Farell (1920 – 5 October 2015) was an American bridge player. She won major tournaments as Mary Jane Kauder too. Farell grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, and \"couldn't wait to get home from school to kibitz whenever my mother had the game at our house.\" The family moved to Los Angeles when she was 17 and she began playing duplicate bridge there \"with the young men I dated\". She married one of them, Arnold Kauder, who was her mentor. (They divorced.) She began teaching bridge after World War II. Mary Jane and Arnold Kauder won the Hilliard Mixed Pairs (a secondary \"national\" championship after 1946) in 1949 and finished second in 1950. They were second again in 1957, behind Bob Adams and Marilyn Johnson. Johnson and Mary Jane Farell became a strong partnership and won three world championships together. Her second husband Jules Farell died in 2005. Farell was inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 1998."

  "text" : "Matthew \"Matt\" Granovetter (born 1950) is an American and Israeli bridge player and writer. Granovetter is from Ballston Lake, New York and graduated from Hunter College. He subsequently moved to Netanya, Israel. After spending the years from 1993 to 2005 in Israel, he and his wife Pamela returned to the USA and now live in Cincinnati. In pairs competition, Granovetter and Karen McCallum won the 11th quadrennial World Mixed Pairs Championship in 2006, finishing first in a field of 487. In teams-of-four competition at the world level, Granovetter played on second-place teams in the 1974 Mixed Teams and the 2008 Seniors Teams. The latter, third in a quadrennial series played for the Senior International Cup, was a non-medal event at the inaugural World Mind Sports Games. Granovetter played with Russ Ekeblad on a US team that won its 5-day preliminary round-robin field of 16 teams with Japan second. After winning three long knockout matches each, over five more days, Japan defeated USA by merely 202 IMPs to 200 in the two-day final. Granovetter–Ekeblad scored very well in the 5-day preliminaries, third-best of about 100 pairs. In 1983, Granovetter took part in a televised match between teams representing the US and Britain, arranged by the BBC. The match was featured in a book that described him thus:He is a composer and lyricist and he plays Bridge like an artist. One moment he is suffused with extrovert optimism, the next he is submerged in gloomy introspection which leads to some unsound overbidding and some extreme conservatism. Very often, to achieve the artistically perfect result, he plays so slowly that the whole table seems frozen in some timeless still-life, but he demonstrated time and again that he was one of the best card players on either side. He and his wife Pamela Granovetter co-edit the magazine Bridge Today. He has written a number of bridge books, most of them collaborations with Pamela, as well as two musicals for children. He is the bridge editor of the Jerusalem Post. The Granovetters have developed a bidding system known as GUS, standing for the Granovetter Unified System."

He moved to Los Angeles a few years later, and won two Southern California Chess Championships before he switched to bridge. For most of his life, he earned a living at the bridge table, primarily by playing rubber bridge for money stakes at clubs. According to Eddie Kantar, who judged him \"America's greatest bridge player\" in 1972, Schleifer did have many clients at duplicate bridge, or tournament play, and could have become rich if he had not been a heavy loser betting on the horse races. Schleifer was inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 2000."

Hill studied at the Rambert Dance Company which she joined in 1944 at the age of 15 where she went on to become a soloist and a principal dancer. She joined the Royal Ballet in 1952. Sir Peter Wright described Hill as \"a superb artist who joined the company from Rambert, but who did not really fit into the required Royal Ballet mould\". Hill appeared in Kenneth MacMillan's first choreographed work, Somnabulism in 1953, alongside Maryon Lane. However, Hill fell ill at the last minute, and MacMillan himself danced her role, improvising his own choreography as he went. Nonetheless, the ballet was \"a triumph\", and it was televised by the BBC in 1954 under its new title, The Dreamers. Hill later returned to the Rambert Dance Company in 1953 for two years after which she returned to The Royal Ballet in 1956. She had a close relationship with Kenneth MacMillan, and he created Solitaire for her in 1956. Wright and The Guardian note that Hill was his first muse, but that Lynn Seymour was to supplant her in his affections and become more enduring and famous. Hill's first marriage was to Leonard Dommet, a violinist, at the age of 19. She later married fellow ballet dancer Michael Boulton (who was in the original cast for Solitaire) in 1959, with whom she has a son and a daughter."

After graduating from the University of Nottingham in 1953, she worked in the British Civil Service as an Agricultural Advisory Officer from 1955-1960. She moved to the USA in 1960 under the auspices of a Kellogg Foundation Fellowship to study Genetics and Statistics at Iowa State University. She married quantitative geneticist James F. Kidwell in 1961, obtained her MS degree in 1962 and moved with her husband to Brown University in 1963. She received her PhD from Brown University in 1973 under the guidance of Masatoshi Nei. From 1973 to 1984 she pursued independent research into a number of anomalous genetic phenomena in Drosophila which later lead to collaborative studies resulting in the discovery of hybrid dysgenesis and the isolation of transposable P elements. After appointment as Professor of Biology at Brown University in 1984 she moved to the University of Arizona in 1985 as Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Additional positions included Chair of the Interdisciplinary Genetics Program from 1988-1991 and Head of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from 1992-1997. Research at the University of Arizona has increasingly focused on the evolutionary significance of transposable genetic elements. In 1996, she was the first woman from Arizona to be elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences."

  "text" : "Mohammad Sarengat (October 28, 1939 – October 13, 2014) was an Indonesian track and field sprinter. Sarengat became the first Indonesian athlete to win a gold medal at the Asian Games. He won gold in the 100-meter sprint at the 1962 Asian Games. Born in Kedunguter in Banyumas Regency, he grew up in Batang Regency before settling in Surabaya. He came from a sporting family – his uncle Mursanyoto was a goalkeeper for the Indonesia national football team. Sarengat won the gold medal in the 100-meter sprint at the 1962 Asian Games held in Jakarta in 10.4 seconds. The win made Sarengat the first Indonesian gold medalist at any Asian Games. He also won a second gold medal at the competition, winning the 110-meter hurdles with an Asian record time of 14.3 seconds. He also won a bronze medal in the 200-meter sprint. Sarengat held the Indonesian record for the 100-meter sprint (10.4 seconds) for the next twenty-two years, until it was broken by sprinter Purnomo M. Yudhi at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Only two other Indonesian athletes have won gold medals at the Asian Games since 1962 - Supriyati Sutono and Maria Natalia Londa. Following his Asian Games win, his only other international medal of note was a silver medal in the 110 m hurdles at the 1963 GANEFO Games, where he placed behind China's Gao Jiqiao. Following his retirement, a football stadium in Batang Regency (his home area) was named in honour as the Moh Sarengat Stadium. After finishing his sports career he trained as a medic and went on to serve as physician for the Indonesian vice president Adam Malik. Sarengat died on October 13, 2014, at Pondok Indah Hospital in South Jakarta at the age of 73. He had been hospitalized since suffering a stroke in 2012. He was survived by his wife and children."

  "text" : "Moshe Bromberg (Moshe Bar-Am) (1920-1982) was a Polish-Israeli-Canadian artist. Bromberg was born in Piotrków Trybunalski, near Łódź, Poland in December 1920. He studied art in Kraków when the Second World War broke out. He and his brother were in a German concentration work camp for a short period but managed to escape, eventually ending in the USSR during the war, where he completed his studies and married Berta. Moshe's parents and sister perished in the Holocaust. He returned to Poland after the war and began his long and fruitful career as an artist, sculptor and art teacher. His first set of oil paintings and sketches, shown in various exhibitions throughout Poland between the period 1945-1950, depicted the horrors he experienced during the war. Bromberg (who changed his name to Moshe Bar-Am) continued his art work after immigrating to Israel in the summer of 1950 with his wife, son and daughter. After getting encouragement from the first President of Israel (Itzhak Ben-Zvi), he started working on a unique set of twenty miniature paintings in gouache, showing various biblical subjects. He exhibited his paintings in numerous solo and group exhibitions in Israel (mostly in Ramat-Gan), often addressed by VIPs such as Abba Eban and Menachem Begin. He was awarded artistic merits and distinction and had his art work displayed in various galleries and museums (besides Poland). Later on, his mostly oil paintings, on subjects ranging from Jewish Rabbis portraits, Partisans fighting, Israeli scenery and still life were also exhibited in Canada. Bromberg died after a lengthy illness in July 1982 in Toronto, Ontario."

  "text" : "Megumi Fujiwara (藤原 恵 Fujiwara Megumi, born 19 June 1969) is a Japanese former long-distance runner. Her career flourished in the early 1990s. Her first international competition came at the 1991 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, where she came 61st in the women's senior race. She set track bests the following year, running 32:03.78 minutes in Kobe (ranking in the top 30 for the year) then a time of 68:07.6 minutes for the 20,000 m track distance, placing her in the top ten all-time women for the infrequently competed event. Her greatest achievement followed that September when she ran at the 1992 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships and claimed the silver medal behind home favourite Liz McColgan, recording a lifetime best of 69:21 minutes for the event. The Japanese women's team including Miyoko Asahina and Eriko Asai were easily the champions, with their combined time being over two minutes faster than the British. As of 2014, this remains the only time that Japanese women have won that title. The last prominent appearance of her career came at the Miyazaki Women's Road Race, where she was runner-up to China's Wang Xiuting."
