  "text" : "Nuzha Yacoub Al-Ghussein, (1926-2013), was a lifelong political and women’s rights activist who helped establish many of the women’s institutions in the West Bank and Jerusalem and who organised the very first civilian protests against Israeli occupation post the June 1967 war. She was the founder of several orphanages and charity schools and a great advocate for empowering girls particularly from disadvantaged and refugee backgrounds. She also founded the Young Women’s Muslim Association, dedicated to the same purpose and was a tireless worker for the support of Palestinian political prisoners. Throughout her life she was a great believer that in the highly fragmented Palestinian political scene there was no limit to what could be achieved if one allowed others to take the credit. Born in Wadi Hunein and raised in what was reportedly the largest country house in Palestine, Nuzha was introduced to politics early when her father was the first Palestinian leader to be exiled by the British in 1936. She subsequently saw her country house fire bombed by Jewish terrorist organisations during the troubles. She married Anwar Bey Nusseibeh in 1942 who was also involved in politics with her father. She was possessed with a high degree of personal physical courage. When her husband’s second amputation (the result of a wound sustained in the 1948 war) failed and she was told of a British miracle drug available on the black market called penicillin, she drove with her husband’s law clerk from Beirut to Jerusalem (147 miles) under heavy shelling in the final stages of the 1948 war, gathered some Persian carpets and silverware from her home (seeing it for the last time) and drove back to Beirut, sold her possessions and bought the penicillin that saved her husband. This same personal courage was demonstrated when she organised one of the first nationalist Palestinian demonstrations against King Hussain’s administration after Sharon’s raid on Samou village in 1966. In the meantime, along with Hind Husseini and Amal Sahhar she helped establish several orphanages and charity schools for refugee girls as well as campaigning for women’s rights and creating women’s institutes. After the fall of Jerusalem in 1967 she organised the first civilian protest against Israeli occupation, made up entirely of women, which was then followed by several protest sit-ins and hunger strikes that attracted media attention to the Palestinian plight. She also organised the erection of monuments to mark the graves of fallen Arab soldiers in that conflict, against direct military orders to the contrary. These grave markers were subsequently removed by the Israeli military and she increasingly became the target of the attention of the Israeli security who often picked her up for questioning in the early hours of the morning. Nonetheless, she worked tirelessly to support Palestinian political prisoners, organising the delivery of food an clothing parcels to them and helping rehabilitate them once released from Israeli military prisons. By the mid 1970s she had moved on to rehabilitating Palestinian common criminals by channelling their energies towards political activism, thus launching the first Palestinian acting troupe that staged the first Palestinian political play in the YMCA theatre in Jerusalem in the midst of the 1976 troubles to much Palestinian acclaim, but which was shut down by the Israeli censors after one night. With advancing age she dedicated herself increasingly to her women’s organisations and charities, notably the YWMA which she established in 1975. A lifelong left-leaning populist she combined charity work with economic empowerment as a means of political liberation for the poor, particularly women. Despite the fact that her marriage was an arranged one and that she occupied the opposite political spectrum to her husband, they formed an effective political couple in occupied Jerusalem. She is survived by her children: Munira; Saida; Zaki; Sari; Hatem and Saker. Her funeral on 22 December 2013 in the Noble Sanctuary in Jerusalem was reported to be the largest funeral Jerusalem had seen since that of her husband who died in 1986. She was made a Knight of Jerusalem in 2010 in recognition of her lifelong dedication to Jerusalem."

  "text" : "Nince \"Sekyanzi\" Henry (born c. 1989) is a Ugandan song writer and a musician. he rose to prominence in Ugandas' music industry after writing successful songs to some big musicians in Uganda like Bebe Cool, Juliana Kanyomozi, Iryn Namubiru and others. As a singer Nince Henry has also released some songs which have won air play on Ugandas Radio stations, songs like Cinderella, Mali yangu, mpola mpola and others. In 2012, Nince had some song writing projects with juliana, following the writing of the song \"Sikyakaaba\" which juliana was supposed to release-however there were some unknown disagreements between the two parties (Nince and juliana) and the two musicians produced the same song with the same title and lyrics, this caused confusion over who owned the song, which aroused mistrust between the two musicians. In 2013 Nince stage his first concert \"MPOLA MPOLA CONCERT\""

  "text" : "Nathaniel Harrington Bannister (January 13, 1813 – November 2, 1847) was an American actor and playwright, one of the better American playwrights of his day. Bannister wrote over 40 plays, including the very popular Putnam, the Iron Son of '76 (1844) about the American Revolutionary War hero Israel Putnam which played for 78 consecutive nights in New York at the Bowery Theatre (produced by Thomas S. Hamblin), an astounding success for its time. The bulk of Bannister's many works, only some of which were published, are historical dramas. Bannister was born in Delaware (some sources report Maryland) in 1813, and made his first appearance on stage in Baltimore at age 16 in the role of Young Norval. He died in poverty in New York on November 2, 1847. Bannister was married to actress Amelia Greene, who was previously married to John Augustus Stone."

He served as FAS vice-chairman for two years before he was appointed chairman on 31 March 1976, and was a vice-president of the Asian Football Confederation. He stepped down as FAS chairman in 1982. He was a criminal lawyer by trade. Ganesan was born in Tank Road to Ceylonese Tamil parents, the youngest of five children. After the war, he studied at Victoria School and later at Anglo-Chinese School. He had been a table-tennis and hockey player, a track athlete and a footballer. He was responsible for changing the Malaysia Cup venue from the Jalan Besar Stadium to the 55,000 capacity National Stadium. He also revamped the local leagues and their 118 teams into the 30-team National Football League. Ganesan was a staunch supporter of coach Choo Seng Quee, whom he brought in as national coach after his election. Choo led Singapore to a Malaysia Cup title in 1977, twelve years after the team last won the competition. He fought for the Pre-World Cup tournament to be held in Singapore's National Stadium in 1977. Singapore finished second in the group but lost to Hong Kong in the play-off final. The Lion City Cup was founded by Ganesan in 1977 as the first Under-16 tournament in the world. The tournament would serve as inspiration for FIFA to introduce the FIFA U-16 World Championship in 1985. Ganesan was awarded the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat medal in 1978 for his services to Singapore football. He suffered a stroke in 2011 and moved to a nursing home where he has stayed since. He later died on 1 July 2015 in the morning, aged 82."

His art career began in 1992, and he has since exhibited at The Museum of Modern Art, The New Museum of Contemporary Art, The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, NGBK Kunsthalle Berlin and El Centro de Cultura Contemporània. His work is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Goldberg’s video Surfacing was featured on 15 screens in Times Square for the month of June 2013 as part of Midnight Moment, a program organized and supported by the Times Square Advertising Coalition in partnership with Times Square Arts, the public art program for the Times Square Alliance. Goldberg is a critic at the Yale School of Art. He has also appeared as a visiting artist at Parsons/The New School, The School of Visual Arts, Cooper Union, New York University, and Temple University. His work has earned him fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the New York State Council of the Arts, the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, the Harpo Foundation, Yaddo and the MacDowell Colony. Goldberg's 2012 solo exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York was the first video installation at that venue. Randy Kennedy of the New York Times has called Goldberg's work \"tender, moving and sad but also deeply funny.\" Time Out NY said \"Goldberg has produced some of the most quietly intense and affecting art of his generation.\""

  "text" : "Narayan Srinivasa Fugro (March 2, 1932 – September 1, 2009) was an Indian politician. He served as the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Goa, Daman and Diu between February 24, 1972 and January 20, 1980. He was the son of Shriniwas Krishna and Radhabai. Fugro became a municipal councilor in Diu in 1959. In 1967 he became the president of the Amichand Rupchand Charitable Dispensary Trust in Diu. He was elected as an independent candidate from the Diu seat in the first Legislative Assembly election in 1967, with 1,552 votes (23.60% of the votes in the constituency). In April 1971, he voted against a motion to include Konkani language in the Eight Scheduled of the Constitution of India. He retained the Diu seat in the 1972 election, obtaining 4,598 votes (58.08%). He again won the Diu seat in the 1977 election, with 5,522 votes (56.41%). His candidature was supported by the Congress (I). In 1979 Fugro withdrew his support to the Shashikala Kakodkar cabinet, leading to its fall and the imposition of President's Rule. He lost the Diu seat in the 1980 election, finishing in second place with 4,633 votes (43.44%). The election campaign was marred with violence, as followers of Fugro's opponent went on riot in Diu. Two people were killed in the clashes. Fugro again finished in second place in Diu the 1984 election, with 5,727 votes (47.15%). After Daman and Diu were separated from Goa and given Union Territory status of its own, a by-election for a new Lok Sabha constituency was held on November 7, 1987. Fugro finished in second place, trailing behind Gopal Kalan Tandel of the Indian National Congress. Fugro had stood as an independent candidate, obtaining 9,303 votes. He died at the age of 78, after prolonged illness."

  "text" : "Nicholas Netterville, 5th Viscount Netterville (1708-1750) was an Irish peer, who is mainly remembered nowadays for having been tried and acquitted by his peers on a charge of murder. He was the only son of John, 4th Viscount Netterville, and his wife Frances, daughter of Richard Parsons, 1st Viscount Rosse. He succeeded to the title in 1727. In 1731 he married Katherine Burton, daughter of Samuel Burton, High Sheriff of Carlow, and his wife Anne Campbell, and had one son and two daughters. He was a prominent Freemason, who served as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1732. In 1742 he was charged with the murder of Michael Walsh of County Meath. Possibly because no evidence was actually given at the trial, remarkably little information survives about the victim, his supposed connection with his killer, or the details of the murder. Lord Netterville claimed the privilege of being tried by his peers. The case aroused great interest among the public, no doubt partly because it was only 5 years since another Irish peer, Lord Santry, had been tried and convicted of murder. On 3 February 1743 the Irish House of Lords assembled to try Lord Netterville, who pleaded not guilty. The trial was something of an anti-climax, since the Crown explained that the two principal witnesses for the prosecution had died, and the law of evidence did not permit their depositions to be read. In the circumstances his peers had no hesitation in finding him \"Not Guilty\". He died on 9 March 1750 and was succeeded in the title by his only son John, 6th Viscount Netterville."

When Aratus insisted on the destruction of the portrait, Nealkes cried out in tears and finally offered to cancel the face by his own hand in order to save the rest of the artwork. He then painted a palm where the tyrant stood, but forgot his feet which remained visible underneath the chariot. The best known of his own paintings were a portrait of Aphrodite and a Battle on the Nile with a famous detail showing an ass on the bank of the river being attacked by a crocodile. His daughter was the painter Anaxandra, and his color-grinder was Erigonus, who was also a teacher of the modeller Aegineta."

Kapetanidis also published his own newspaper Epochi (Season). He got also involved in educational issues, supporting the use of vernacular Greek in the local schools. Moreover, he insisted that education shouldn't be controlled by the religious authorities, in particular the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Kapetanidis was hanged in Amasya, in September 1921, by the Turkish nationalists under Mustafa Kemal (later Ataturk) during the Pontic Greek Genocide. He was among several other notable figures of the local Greek community hanged there."

  "text" : "Nicholas Grigoryevich Sergeyev (1876–1951) (Russian: Никола́й Григорьевич Серге́ев, variously written in the Latin alphabet as Nicholas or Nikolai Sergeev, Sergueev or Sergueeff etc.) was a Russian ballet dancer, choreographer and teacher, and regisseur of the Imperial Ballet at the Maryinsky Theatre, St Petersburg. He fled Russia in 1919 and spent the rest of his life in the west, producing ballets for many of the leading western companies of the time. He is best remembered for preserving what is now called the Sergeyev Collection for future generations. Sergeyev was born September 15, 1876 in St Petersburg. He was accepted for training by the Imperial Ballet School and he graduated and joined the company in 1894. He was promoted to soloist and régisseur in 1904 and régisseur-général in 1914. He was thus the last ever régisseur-général of the Imperial Ballet. In 1919 he and his wife fled Russia, as did many Russian ballet professionals after the Bolshevik revolution. It was a hazardous journey and the last leg was from Riga on a British warship. He was not the only one the Royal Navy helped to escape. Tamara Karsavina escaped from Murmansk with her husband, the British diplomat Henry James Bruce, with the aid of sailors of a British cruiser stationed in the White Sea, and Mathilde Kschessinskaya escaped from the Black Sea port of Novorossisk with her lover and future husband, the Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich, with the aid of sailors at a British base there. Not for nothing did Soviet Russia describe the British and other nations that interfered in the Russian Civil War as the “foreign interventionists”. Sergeyev brought with him the records of the Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov choreographies of some 20 classical ballets in the Stepanov notation, what is now known as the Sergeyev Collection, fearing that these invaluable records would be lost to posterity in the upheaval of the Bolshevik Revolution and the Civil War that followed. He used these records in his subsequent employment by many of the leading Western ballet companies of the time, and after his death they finished up housed at the Harvard University Library Theatre Collection. In 1921 he met Serge Diaghilev in Paris. He had of course known Diaghilev in St Petersburg when they both worked for the Imperial Ballet. Diaghilev hired him for his Ballets Russes company and brought him to London to reproduce in its original form the ballet Sleeping Princess (now known as Sleeping Beauty) for his season at the Alhambra Theatre. After disagreements with Diaghilev he went to Riga as regisseur of the Latvian National Opera Ballet. He also founded his own company and produced Act IV of La Bayadere, La Fille mal Gardee, and Paquita, all from his Maryinsky notations. In 1925 the émigré Russian Prima Ballerina Olga Spessivtseva hired him to produce Giselle for her at the Paris Opera. This was a huge success, and gained for him the medal of L'Academie Nationale de Musique et la Danse. Back in Riga he found his own ballet company in financial difficulties, so he joined the newly formed Russian Opera Company as ballet master. The company went on a world tour producing excerpts from classical ballets and operatic interludes. In 1934 this company was disbanded and Sergeyev came to London. He produced Giselle first for the Camargo Society and then for the Vic-Wells Company, with Spessivtseva, Markova and Dolin as principals at some of the performances. He stayed with the Vic-Wells to produce Swan Lake, Coppelia, and Casse Noisette, all from his original Maryinsky notations. He also worked for the Markova-Dolin company, which operated from 1935 to 1937, and the Metropolitan Opera Ballet at some point. By 1940 his relations with the Vic-Wells (now renamed Sadlers Wells) and its director Ninette de Valois had become strained and he joined International Ballet, the fledgling touring company that had just been formed by Mona Inglesby. He never had a formal contract but it was an arrangement that suited both sides admirably and he stayed with International Ballet for the rest of his life. He had a new company of young dancers to train and rehearse in the traditions of the Maryinsky and a young director who believed in his methods. Inglesby had the only person in the world outside Soviet Russia who could produce the classical ballets in their original Petipa/Ivanov forms, which is what she wanted her company to do. Between 1941 and 1948 he re-created full length productions of the classics Giselle, Coppelia, Sleeping Princess and Swan Lake, as well as some shorter ballets and some short extracts from the classics. He worked with International Ballet until his health started to fail, and he died in Nice on 23 June 1951 aged 74."

A graduate at the University of Calgary in Canada, Jacobs trained for the university's wrestling team under his head coach Leigh Vierling. Jacobs qualified for the Namibian squad, as the nation's first and lone wrestler, in the men's heavyweight class (96 kg) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, with a remarkable milestone. Earlier in the process, he placed sixth in the 97-kg division at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, which automatically secured him a spot for his Olympic debut. He lost two straight matches each to Kazakhstan's Islam Bairamukov with a 1–7 decision, and Azerbaijan's Rustam Aghayev, who pinned him into the mat by both an eleven-point advantage and a technical fall, in the prelim pool, finishing eighteenth overall in the final rankings."

In 2013 he was signed to the AZ label after many years with the rap label Street Loud formed by members of the French rap collective Mafia K'1 Fry. He started earlier releasing his street album Niroshima III in 2007. Niro became the first independent act to be signed to Street Lourd. His first single \"70 Kg\" was released in 2011 followed by \"Dans ton kwaah\" and \"Pikassos\". He was featured on recordings by well-known rappers including Seth Gueko, Kery James and Booba. He is considered one of the prominent figures of French \"street rap\" (le rap de rue). In 2012, he released his debut studio album Paraplégique that contained many of his earlier hits. Immediately after the release of the album, he was involved in legal problems on some minor charges, arrested after a police chase and sentenced to a five-month term. While in jail, he composed his second album Rééducation that he released to critical acclaim in 2013 addressing his legal problems. In 2014, he returned with a third album Miraculé with AZ. He followed this with Si je me souviens in 2015 and Or Game in 2016."

Throughout his sporting career, Paslar trained full time as a member of the wrestling squad for Slavia Sports Club in Sofia under his personal coach Ilian Stefanov. As a naturalized member of the Bulgarian squad, Paslar emerged into the international scene at the 2001 World Wrestling Championships in Sofia, where he thrashed Iranian wrestler Amir Tavakkolian for the gold in the 69-kg division. For displaying his early success to the sport, Paslar was highly acclaimed the Best Wrestler of the Year by the Bulgarian Sports Federation and the International Federation of Associated Wrestling (FILA). At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Paslar qualified for his first Bulgarian team in the men's 74 kg class with an unforeseen result. Unable to fill an available spot from the World Championships, Paslar luckily received a ticket to the Olympics by defeating Georgia's Gela Saghirashvili for a first-place finish at the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Sofia. Paslar could not pull a 3–3 tie to overwhelm Poland's Krystian Brzozowski on his opening match, but eclipsed the neighboring Macedonia's Sihamir Osmanov with a 3–1 victory to close the round-robin. Finishing second in the prelim pool and eleventh overall, Paslar's performance fell short to advance him further into the quarterfinals. Determined to offer another shot of a medal from a four-year drought, Paslar had picked up a gold in the 74-kg division at the 2005 European Championships in Varna, and a bronze at the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary. He continued to flourish his sporting career at the next World and European Championships, but left them empty-handed before his impending retirement in 2007. In 2013, Paslar came out of retirement from the sport to compete again for the World Championships in Budapest. Fighting at ten kilograms heavier than his previous sporting years, Paslar qualified for the men's light heavyweight category, but made an unprecedented exit with a 5–0 loss to Georgian wrestler and 2012 Olympian Dato Marsagishvili in his opening match."

  "text" : "Nagendra Prasad Sarbadhikary, who is now known as the father of Indian football for his role in introducing soccer as a teenager in the year 1877 at Hare School, Calcutta. It is he who mobilized his classmates and started playing the game at the Hare School compound. Attracted by the enthusiasm of the boys in the school, the European teachers of the school and adjacent colleges encouraged Nagendra Prasad and his companions to promote the game among students in and around Calcutta. The Boys' Club, founded by Nagendra Prasad around this time, was the first Indian initiative at football organization. Later he formed a string of sporting clubs in Calcutta in the 1880s, one of the first being the Wellington. Moni Das was one of the first members to be inducted by Nagendra Prasad to the Wellington club, but, the other members of the club protested about playing with this man as he was from the lower caste. Sarbadhikary said that a sporting ground is beyond any prejudice. But he was however forced by the members' protest to dismantle the Wellington Club in 1884. Soon after, 500 members left and Nagendra Prasad founded the Sovabazar Club, one of the leading sports institutions of colonial India. The first member of this new club was Moni Das. He later captained the Mohun Bagan Club, yet another legendary institution of sports in India, colonial and post colonial. Thus a man from the lower caste, through cricketing prowess and sport broke into the upper echelons of the Hindu society."

  "text" : "Nicholas Kevin Dulvy is the Co-Chair of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Shark Specialist Group  and Canada Research Chair tier II in Marine Biodiversity and Conservation at Simon Fraser University. He has published more than 100 peer-reviewed papers and book chapters on life histories, extinction risk, the ecosystem impacts of fishing and the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of climate change. Dulvy was educated at The Royal School, Armagh. He received his Bachelor of Science in Zoology from University of Birmingham in 1992, and his Doctor of Philosophy from the University of East Anglia in 1998. He spent several years working for the UK Government Fisheries Agency before taking a position at Simon Fraser University in 2008. His contributions to marine ecology include providing evidence for fisheries-induced trophic cascades at the island scale on coral reefs and the discovery that fishes are moving to deeper habitats in response to climate change. Dulvy and co-authors were the first to document marine population and species extinctions. Dulvy's work is notable for its influence on biodiversity conservation, food security, and poverty alleviation. For this work he was the 2008 recipient of the Zoological Society of London's Marsh Award for Marine and Freshwater Conservation which is awarded for \"contributions of fundamental science and its application to the conservation in marine and/or freshwater ecosystems”. The award citation was for “research on the effects of climate change on fisheries and coastal communities, as well as threat and extinction risks in the context of improving fisheries management\". In 2010, he was made a Conservation Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, an award honouring individuals who have made exceptional contributions to conservation. In 2014 Dulvy was the primary author of the first global analysis of the vulnerability of chondrichthyans: \"Extinction risk and conservation of the world’s sharks and rays\", a collaborative effort involving 302 experts from 64 countries. As the most endangered species of sharks and rays are sawfishes, Dulvy and co-authors then developed the first global sawfish conservation strategy."

A number of his subjects have connections with Nottingham, including several owned by the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Castle Museum, and Nottingham City Museums and Galleries. One of his portraits of Jesse Boot, 1st Baron Trent is in the collection of the University of Nottingham, another of the same subject is on loan to the National Portrait Gallery. Among his other notable subjects were Albert Ball V.C. and William Booth, founder of the Salvation Army.

He studied the democratization processes in Finland at the Finnish Department of State (Prime Minister's Office,and also developed ideas and concepts related to social systems in business world. he is considered a major figure in the unification of Finnish trade unions. His magnum opus is a book about Corporate Democracy (Työntekijä ja Yritysdemokratia - January 1966). In his theories Koljonen argues that \"the superior-subordinate system in business enterprises is the enemy of individual freedom. Companies are suffering from this performance,\" and \"concentration of economic power in the hands of too few is alien to democracy.\" The book presents a world in which society in general has accepted democracy and right to vote, but the economic power is concentrated in a few hands, and business world is suffering from lack of worker motivation and poor decisions of the elite. Koljonen describes the empirical data sets on the basis of human motivation in terms of fertile forms of business where every employee is \"inner entrepreneur\", who is working towards a common goal. Foreword to the book was written by Mauno Koivisto.Koljonen set up a Corporate Democracy Association. Tarja Halonen, another president of Finland, was a founding member in the association. In his youth, Koljonen struggled for years to be free from the Soviet Union concentration camps. Niilo Koljonen was the first Finn ever to draw up a map of the Soviet Union concentration camps. In 2012, award winning book publisher and writer Sofi Oksanen released the map 2012 through Silberfeldt, at the National Audiovisual Archive."

  "text" : "Nurlan Altynbekovich Koizhaiganov (Kazakh: Нұрлан Алтынбекұлы Қойжайғанов; born March 27, 1977 in Ayagoz) is a retired amateur Kazakh Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's lightweight category. He scored top five finishes in the 60-kg division in two consecutive editions of the Asian Games (1998 and 2002), and later represented his nation Kazakhstan at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Before being retired from wrestling in 2005, Koizhaiganov also trained throughout his sporting career at Professional Sport Club Daulet in Semipalatinsk, under his personal coach Kanat Nurlasiev. Koizhaiganov qualified for the Kazakh squad in the men's 60 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, he placed first in his respective category from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tashkent, Uzbekistan to guarantee a spot on the Kazakh wrestling team. He easily ousted Italy's Paolo Fucile in his opening match by a quick 7–0 margin, and then overwhelmed 2000 Olympic bronze medalist Akaki Chachua of Georgia 7–6 in the prelim pool to clinch his spot for the next round of the competition. Koizhaiganov lost to neighboring Russia's Aleksey Shvetsov in the quarterfinal match at 1–3, and to Japan's Makoto Sasamoto in a consolation playoff with a comfortable 4–0 verdict, dropping him to sixth in the final standings."

  "text" : "Sir Nicholas T. \"Miki\" Sekers, MBE (12 December 1910 in Sopron, Hungary – 23 June 1972 in Yugoslavia) was a British-based industrialist who, with his cousin, founded Sekers Fabrics. He was also a patron of the arts. Sekers had trained in textile technology in Krefeld, Germany. At the invitation of John Adams (later Lord Adams) who was charged with overcoming the 50% unemployment from which West Cumberland was suffering at the time, Sekers arrived in Britain from Hungary in 1937 with his cousin, Tomi de Gara, to establish West Cumberland Silk Mills at Richmond Hill, Hensingham, West Cumberland, in 1938. During World War II West Cumberland Silk Mills was required to make parachute silk. When supplies of silk ran low, and the new experimental product nylon was introduced as a replacement, Sekers began experimenting with the new synthetic fabric, seeing its potential for dressmaking. An introduction to Christian Dior led to Sekers producing fabrics for him and many others in the field of Haute Couture. In the 1960s, Sekers began to design and produce furnishing fabrics. In 1962 he was awarded the Duke of Edinburgh's Award for Elegant Design (now known as the Prince Philip Designers Prize). He sat on the boards of Glyndeborne, the Royal Opera House, London Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Mozart Players and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and was an early supporter of the painter Percy Kelly. He was an early patron of the portrait painter Judy Cassab and commissioned work by Oliver Messel, Graham Sutherland, John Piper and Suzanne Balkanyi. Sekers established and endowed a trust to convert a barn at his home at Rosehill, Whitehaven, into the Rosehill Theatre. He appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 22 April 1968. He was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1955 for services to the fashion industry, and was knighted in 1965 for services to the arts. Sekers died on 23 June 1972, in Yugoslavia, while on holiday. His portrait, a 1969 photograph by Godfrey Argent is in the National Portrait Gallery."

  "text" : "Nathaniel Penistone Davis (1895-1973) was an American career diplomat. Davis received his B.A. from Princeton University in 1916, and joined the Foreign Service in 1919. He served as Consul in Recife (then Pernambuco), Brazil from 1926 to 1929, then as Vice Consul in London, UK. He was appointed Consul in London in 1929. He returned to State Department assignments in Washington, DC, an inspection tour of US diplomatic missions in South America, and a subsequent inspection tour of US diplomatic missions in the Far East. He was interned in Manila, Philippines, from 1942 to 1943. Davis returned to the Philippines in 1946 as the State Department representative on the staff of the U.S. High Commissioner in the Philippines during the U.S. military occupation. He remained after the independence of the Philippines as Counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Manila from 1946 to 1947. He was American ambassador to Costa Rica from 1947 to 1949, including during the Costa Rican Civil War. He was United States Minister to Hungary from 1949 to 1951. Diplomatic relations between the US and Hungary were downgraded during the Cold War, and there was no US Ambassador to Hungary during that time. The Minister was the chief of the U.S. diplomatic mission. During his time as Minister to Hungary, he handled negotiations with the government of Hungary which led to the release of Robert A. Vogeler, an American citizen and Vice President and representative for Eastern Europe of the International Telephone and Telgraph Co. (ITT) who was arrested in Hungary and tried and convicted as a spy. Davis received the Medal of Freedom in 1946, and the Distinguished Service Award on his retirement from the State Department in 1951. In 1952, after his retirement, he returned to Washington for a month to conduct a confidential review, at the request of Secretary of State Dean Acheson, of the record of O. Edmund Clubb, a U.S. diplomat who had been accused of being a Communist sympathizer by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. On the basis of Davis' report that Clubb was not a security risk, Acheson overturned the decision against Clubb by the State Department's loyalty board, and restored Clubb's pension. Davis was born in Princeton, New Jersey, on May 1, 1895,. He was the son of John D. Davis (Professor at Princeton Theological Seminary and author of Davis' Bible Dictionary) and Marguerite (Scobie) Davis, grandson of Robert and Anne Williams (Shaw) Davis, and great-grandson of John and Anna Maria (Johnston) Davis. He was married in 1919 to Sarah Louise Collins. After his retirement, he lived in Glens Falls and Silver Bay, New York, and later in Winter Park. Florida. He died on September 12, 1973. His autobiography, Few Dull Moments: A Foreign Service Career, was self-published in 1967. His papers are in the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri."

  "text" : "Nina Sergeevna Golubkova (Russian: Нина Сергеевна Голубкова) (January 28, 1932 in Leningrad – August 24, 2009 in Saint Petersburg) was an award-winning Russian lichenologist. In 1955, after graduating from Leningrad State University with a degree in mycology, Golubkova joined the Komarov Botanical Institute, where she worked under the supervision of Vsevolod Savich. In the 1960s, she studied specimens which had been retrieved during various Soviet expeditions to the Antarctic; her research on these samples led to multiple scientific publications and the identification of several new species. She also participated in specimen-collecting expeditions to the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan, and to the steppes, taiga, and desert of Mongolia, and in 1978, she was a contributor to volume 5 of the Handbook of Lichens of the USSR. In 1982, Golubkova was promoted to director of the Institute's Lichenology and Bryology Laboratory, a position she retained for over 20 years. In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, she arranged for the publication of volumes 6 through 10 of the now-renamed Handbook of Lichens of Russia , of which she served as editor-in-chief. In 2000, Golubkova was awarded the Acharius Medal for lifetime achievement in lichenology. Two lichen species, Chaenothecopsis golubkovae and Catillaria golubkovae, have been named in her honor. The standard author abbreviation N.S.Golubk. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Natalia Ivanova (Russian: Наталья Иванова; born May 11, 1969 in Angarsk, Russian SFSR) is a retired amateur Russian and Tajik freestyle wrestler, who competed in the women's middleweight category. Considered one of Russia's top female wrestlers of her decade, Ivanova has yielded a remarkable tally of six career medals, including two silver at the World Championships (1995 and 1996), before she acquired a dual citizenship to compete for Tajikistan in 2002. Since then, she scored a sixth spot in the 63-kg division at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, and also finished eleventh at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Ivanova is also a member of the wrestling squad for Pobeda Sports and Military Games Club in Angarsk, under her personal coach Valery Saiziev. While competing for the Russian team, Ivanova emerged herself into a sporting fame at the 1995 World Wrestling Championships in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where she captured a silver medal in the 61-kg division, losing to Austria's Nikola Hartmann. By the following year, she campaigned for her runner-up defense in the same tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria, and then boasted for the bronze at the European Championships in Oslo, Norway. Before leaving for the Tajik squad in 2002, Ivanova held a remarkable record of six medals; three of which came from the World Championships, and the rest from the European Championships. When she entered the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea as a crowd favorite in the women's middleweight category (63 kg), Ivanova missed a chance to capture another medal to her career hardware, placing sixth in the process. When women's wrestling made its debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Ivanova qualified for her naturalized Tajik squad in the inaugural 63 kg class. Earlier in the process, she placed third and guaranteed a spot on the Tajik wrestling team from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tunis, Tunisia. Ivanova lost two straight matches each to Belarus' Volha Khilko (1–4) and eventual Olympic bronze medalist Lise Legrand of France (0–3), leaving her on the bottom of the pool and placing eleventh in the final standings."

Mossolow first came to Namibia, then named South West Africa, in 1931 to visit his mother who had emigrated to that country and married a German Karakul farmer shortly after his father's death. He returned to Europe to study History of Art, Anthropology, Archaeology and Ancient Languages at the University of Dorpat in Estonia, the Friedrich-Wilhelms University in Berlin, and the German Archaeological Institute in Rome. but returned to South West Africa in 1939 when he saw that the outbreak of WWII was inevitable. He then worked as an archivist in the National Archives in Windhoek and later published numerous historical books and articles about South West African places, persons and events. Mossolow married Gisela Herta Alice Wollmann, and on his retirement in the early 1980s, he and his family moved to Somerset West outside Cape Town, South Africa, where he died on 9 November 1988. His daughter is the well known South African operatic soprano Sabina Mossolow."

Nathan was the youngest son of Daniel Boone. Nathan Boone was born at Boone Station, near Athens, Fayette County, Kentucky in 1780 and moved to Spanish Missouri with the family in 1799. In 1807 he and his brother Daniel first worked the Salt licks in what became known as the Booneslick Country. The brothers built the Boone's Lick Road, which became a major overland route in early Missouri. Boone took part in the War of 1812 as captain of a company of rangers which scouted in the country between the Mississippi and Illinois. He also took part in an expedition led by Henry Dodge to relieve settlers who had been raided by Miami Indians. He and Dodge saved 150 Miamis from massacre by members of their own militia. The Miamis had agreed to surrender as prisoners of war, and certain members of the militia became angered when they found contraband belonging to a settler who had been killed in the original raid, but Dodge and Boone literally stood in the line of fire and forced the nearly mutinous troops to back down. He attained the rank of major in the militia in this war. After he was mustered out Boone retired to his farm in St. Charles County, Missouri. He built the first stone house north of the Missouri and his father died there. In 1820 he was a delegate to the Missouri constitutional convention He participated in the Black Hawk War in 1832. After the conclusion of those hostilities, he entered the regular army as captain in the United States Regiment of Dragoons, direct predecessor of the 1st Cavalry Regiment (United States Army), the regiment's first commander being Colonel Dodge. He participated in the First Dragoon Expedition, notable for making the first contact between the United States federal government and the southern plains Indians. His army service further included participation in the Second Dragoon Expedition, surveying the boundaries between the Creek and Cherokee Indian nations, and leading his own expedition into the southwestern plains in 1843. In 1847 was made major in the army, and lieutenant-colonel in 1853. In 1853, Nathan Boone resigned and retired to his home in Missouri, Greene County, Missouri, where he died in 1857. In the fall of 1851, Nathan Boone and his wife Olive were interviewed by Wisconsin Historical Society archivist Lyman C. Draper concerning his famous father. Along with the interviews, Boone presented Draper with a collection of family papers. Draper wrote a manuscript about Daniel Boone which was finally published as an edited and annotated version in 1998."

As such, he would have ruled in the 17th century BC from Avaris over the eastern Nile Delta and possibly over the Western Delta as well. Alternatively, the egyptologists Erik Hornung and Elisabeth Staehelin read the inscription on the scarab attributed to Nuya as Khyan, the name of a powerful Hyksos king of the 15th Dynasty c. 1610–1580 BC. This reading is emphatically rejected by the egyptologist Darrell Baker however, who remains cautious about Nuya's identity."

  "text" : "Nevzat Halili (born September 15, 1946), is a Macedonian politician and teacher of English. Halili was first elected to the Macedonian parliament in 1991 and is a member of the Party for Democratic Prosperity. In an open letter to president Kiro Gligorov in 1993, Halili argued that the Albanians in Macedonia were discriminated against in the state administration and the public sector. He was minister without portfolio in the second government of Branko Crvenkovski (1994-1998). During the 1990s, Halili was sentenced to prison for participation in demonstrations and preventing police officers from exercising their duty. In 2001, Halili joined the National Democratic Party established by Kastriot Haxhirexha and Xhezair Shaqiri (\"Commander Hoxha\"). He was later linked with several paramilitary organisations campaigning for the unification of Albanian-populated territories in the Balkans. On 2 July 2002, the US state Department blocked the assets of Halili for providing leadership or material support to armed insurgents in the western Balkans. This activity threatened international stabilisation efforts in the region. Halili was arrested in 2006 in Prishtina on suspicions of arms trafficking, but was released after eight months in custody. In January 1992, the Republic of Ilirida, a territorial entity, was self-proclaimed by Nevzat Halili and other Albanian activists in Struga. The republic would cover approximatively half of Macedonia's territory and aimed at uniting all Albanians under former Yugoslavia. Later on, the aim of the republic was that of favoring the federalization of Macedonia. On 19 September 2014, Halili read out a declaration of an \"independent Republic of Ilirida\" at Skanderbeg Square in Skopje to a few dozen ethnic Albanians."

Triffitt had a reputation for being outspoken and opinionated. A journalist wrote in 1987: \"Nigel Triffit enjoys criticism. He doesn't mind being called rude, enfant terrible or genius. It's bland reporting with no comment that bores him.\" He was openly gay. In 1994 he published a gay-themed novel Cheap Thrills. Despite not being a Triffitt by birth, he maintained a blog on the history of the Triffitt family. He died of an AIDS-related illness in Melbourne."

  "text" : "Nikolija Jovanović (Serbian Cyrillic: Николија Јовановић, born on 19 October 1989), professionally known just as Nikolija, is a Serbian R&B/Hip hop recording artist, dancer and photo model. Known for her drastic changes in stage appearance and seductive music style, she is currently one of the most popular singers in Serbia and the region. Her desire to become a singer emerged mainly because of her mother Vesna Zmijanac, who is a well known folk singer in the Balkan region. She started her music career in 2011 in Greece as a club dancer and master of ceremonies. Nikolija also recorded her first song there, but failed to achieve success. After that, she moved to Serbia to restart her career in 2013 with R&B and rap songs which had attention-grabbing and controversial lyrics. Actually, she brought that kind of music to west Balkans. After successful singles like Kako posle mene, Alkohola litar and Opasna igra Nikolija gained enormous popularity in the region. Additionally, her music video for Opasna igra was the second most watched video in Serbia for 2015. She is currently working on her long-awaited debut album. Jovanovic has a university degree and speaks three foreign languages (Greek, English, and French). Nikolija has been in a relationship with singer Relja Popović, former member of Elitni Odredi band, since 2014 and got pregnant with him. Unfortunately, she lost their baby in the third month of pregnancy. In the first half of 2016, Nikolija got pregnant again. On 26th September 2016 she gave a birth to a girl named Rea (meaning to flow in Greek). Both of her pregnancies were the hot topics in media for months that followed. Nikolija took part in the reality television show, Survivor Srbija VIP: Philippines in 2010 and Ples sa Zvezdama (Season 1) in 2014."

  "text" : "Naheed Abidi was born in 1961, in a Muslim zamindari family at Mirzapur, in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Choosing Sanskrit as her subject, Abidi did her graduation at the Kamla Maheshwari Degree College and secured her MA from the K. V. Degree College, Mirzapur. She moved to Varanasi, an ancient seat of Sanskrit scholarship after her marriage with Ehtesham Abidi - an advocate in the city. Varanasi is deemed holy by the Hindu text Garuda Purana. She went on to secure a doctoral degree (PhD) from the Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith (MGKV), a public university in the city, and published her thesis titled as Vedic Sahitya Mein Ashviniyon Ka Swaroop (The Form of Ashvinis in Vedic Literature) in 1993. In 2005, Abidi started working as a lecturer without any pay at Banaras Hindu University. Soon after, she joined the Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith to work as a part-time lecturer on a daily wage scheme. However, the Sanskrit scholar,known as the first Muslim female to have worked as a lecturer in Sanskrit, had difficulties finding a regular job. Her first book was published in 2008 and was titled Sanskrit Sahitya Mein Rahim - which is an account of the Sanskrit leanings of the renowned poet, Abdul Rahim Khan-e-Khana. This was followed by Devalayasya Deepa, a translation of Chairag-e-Dair, written by poet, Mirza Ghalib. The third book was Sirr-e-Akbar, a Hindi translation of 50 Upanishads, earlier translated by the Mughal prince, Dara Shikoh into Persian. She has published a Hindi translation of Vedanta, translated into Persian by Dara Shikoh and also the Sufi texts by the prince. Naheed Abidi lives with her spouse Ehtesham Abidi and her two children, a son and a daughter, in VDA colony in the Shivpur area of Varanasi. She also serves as an Executive Council member at the Sampurnanad Sanskrit University."

  "text" : "Nobin Chandra Das (1845–1925) was a notable Bengali confectioner, entrepreneur, businessman and Bengali cultural icon of the second half of 19th century and early 20th century. Born and raised in Kolkata at the time of its rise to prominence as the capital of East India Company’s Indian possessions, Nobin Chandra Das’s major contribution to Bengali culture and society was his innovative confectionery which created completely new sweetmeats for the Bengali palate. His creations constitute an important and lasting component of Bengali cuisine today. Widely known as the creator of the iconic Bengali sweetmeat “Rossogolla”/\"Rasgulla\", a popular limerick of 19th-century Bengal labeled him as the “Columbus of Rossogolla”. His other creations include “Abaar Khaabo”, “Dedo Sondesh” and “Baikuntha Bhog”(both of which use \"Kacha Pak\" as the base ingredient), the well known “Kastura Pak” which serves as the refined base ingredient for Sandeshes like “Aata (custard apple) Sondesh” and “Kathaal (jackfruit) Sondesh.”"

During the Operation Blue Star on 6 June 1984, he provided cover for his company commander from heavy firing by the Sikh militants using medium machine guns. Sensing danger to his company from a light machine gun in a pot hole, Singh charged towards the gun. Although he suffered bullet shots on his legs, he crawled to reach the pot hole and lobbed a grenade into the basement, but exposed himself to heavy firing and succumbed to the injuries. For his bravery, he was posthumously awarded the Ashoka Chakra, the highest peace time military decoration in India."

  "text" : "Norman F. Carnahan (born February 27, 1942, New Iberia, Louisiana) is an American chemical engineer, a Fellow of The American Institute of Chemical Engineers. His education in science and mathematics began at St. Pius X High School in Houston, Texas, and continued with engineering and science studies at the University of Houston, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1965. He then worked with Dow Chemical Company Research and Development, where he was mentored by Dr. Daniel R. Stull. In 1968, Carnahan began graduate studies at the University of Oklahoma. His graduate advisor was Professor Kenneth Earl Starling. During his graduate studies, he was influenced by Professors Sherrill D. Christian, Jack Cohn, Cedomir Sliepcevich, and by correspondences with Berni Alder, Bill Hoover, E. Brian Smith, and Ben Widom. Carnahan's vision of molecular interactions and fluid behavior was strongly influenced by the works of Johannes Diderik van der Waals and by René Descartes. His interest in statistical mechanics, physics of fluids, molecular phenomena, and fundamentals of equations of state led to the development of the Carnahan-Starling equation of state. (1969) for the fluid phase of rigid nonattracting spheres, as single components and mixtures (Mansoori-Carnahan-Starling-Leland, 1971) Upon completion of his doctoral studies at University of Oklahoma, in 1971, he began a long research and teaching association with Professors Riki Kobayashi and Thomas W. Leland, Jr., at Rice University, in Houston, Texas. In the 1980s, he resumed work on extending the Carnahan-Starling equation of state to systems of rigid nonattracting nonspherical particles. Together with Professor Erich A. Muller, a series of papers were published in which a shape factor concept was incorporated to enable the equation developed for rigid sphere fluids to be extended to describe the fluid phase of many rigid nonattracting nonspherical particles."
