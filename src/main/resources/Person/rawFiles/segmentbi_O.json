  "text" : "Otto Hitzberger (October 2, 1878 in Munich – July 22 1964 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen) was a German sculptor. Otto Kaspar Hitzberger was born the son of the photographer Josef Hitzberger and his wife Anna. In 1883 the family moved to Partenkirchen. From 1891 to 1895, he learned the craft of wood and stone sculpture in Partenkirchen. In Munich, he worked with Joseph Flossmann. Then Hitzberger worked under George of Hauberrisser at Munich New Town Hall as a stonemason. He perfected his skills as a wood sculptor at an old church sculptor in the Württemberg town of Sussen. He worked throughout Germany, followed by Switzerland, Italy and Austria. In all these countries he worked in many studios and workshops. In 1910 he was again briefly in Partenkirchen, after which he lived for three years in southern Africa, where he worked on altar figures for Boer churches, and cabinets and door panels for farm-houses. In 1914 he returned to Germany, after Berlin, where he became head of the workshop until 1917 Josef Wackerles was. 1917 he was appointed by Bruno Paul to head the wood and stone sculpture class at the educational institutions of the Berlin Museum of Decorative Arts. 1924, with the union of the higher schools of art Hitzberger moved to Charlottenburg as head of a training workshop for wood and stone sculpture. He held this office until 1943. His work consisted among others in the collaboration in the design of facades and interiors with well-known architects, plastic decoration for interior, reliefs and sculptures full. During the First World War, he was commissioned to the copy the figure of Christ in the Trier Church of Our Lady to copy to preserve the originals from war damage. He also took on the difficult technical part of the a giant statue of Christ by Ludwig Gies, who, after the partial destruction by citizen of Lübeck, was again restored by the maintenance department of the trade show in Munich. The figure was exhibited in the National Socialism as \"degenerate\" and was probably destroyed latter. In 1938, three of Hitzbergers works were exhibited in the Exhibition of Degenerate Art. After the war he developed in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, a late work, which is characterized by unusual vitality and superior wisdom and religiousness. Otto Hitzberger was married twice. From 1902 in Munich closed marriage to Victoria Gaugler (1876-1942) had three children: Anna (born 1903), Otto Georg (born 1904, sculptor) and Friederike (1906). This marriage ended in divorce in 1918. With Martha, divorced Bernhard, born Maass, 1922 in Berlin, he joined his second marriage, which was childless."

The Wetterau had been one of the counties of his father Gebhard, and Odo also acquired two other counties that had been his: Rheingau in 917 and Lahngau in 918. Odo is best known for the Battle of Andernach on 2 October 939. The rebellious dukes Gilbert II of Maasgau and Eberhard of Franconia had looted the counties of Odo and his nephew Conrad (Count of Lower Lahngau) east of the Rhine. Their force was so great that Odo and Conrad could not resist them. But when the insurgents crossed the Rhine again at Andernach to return to Lorraine, Odo and Conrad had a chance. Gilbert and Eberhard were still at their rear on the eastern shore when the bulk of the army had made the crossing. At that moment Odo and Conrad fell and defeated the troops who were left behind. Eberhard was thereby slain and Gilbert drowned when he tried to flee on the Rhine. The rebellion was thus broken and Emperor Otto I the Great could easily recover his authority. Odo thus became a favorite of Otto: at the death of Conrad (949), he was also appointed Count of Lower Lahngau. He married a daughter of Herbert I, Count of Vermandois, presumably named Cunigunda. They had the following children: \n* Gebhard (d. 938), killed in the fight against the insurgency of Thankmar, the elder half-brother of Emperor Otto. \n* Herbert (c. 930 – 992) \n* Otto \n* Odo (d. 26 Aug 965), appointed Bishop of Strasbourg on 13 Aug 950, possibly the same person as his brother Otto. \n* Judith"

Oskar Rabin was one of the originators of non-conformism and one of the organisers of the ‘Lianozovo Group’ which grew up around Yevgeny Kropivnitsky. Over a period of seven years (1958-1965), the former camp barracks in Lianozovo, where Oskar Rabin lived with his wife, Valentina Kropivnitskaya, acted as the centre of the progressive intelligentsia. Soviet material life and its dramatic absurdity was for many years the central theme of Rabin’s creativity. The artist’s favourite genres included landscape, still life and interiors, continuing in the tradition of 1920s European expressionism. Rabin uses a distortion of perspective, the principles of deformation and the destruction of large-scale relationships. Oskar Rabin was an organiser of the dissident Bulldozer Exhibition, an unofficial art exhibition on a vacant lot in the Belyayevo urban forest by Moscow avant-garde artists on September 15, 1974. The exhibition was forcefully broken up by a large police force that included bulldozers and water cannons. In 1978, Oskar Rabin emigrated to Paris."

She is married to Spanish Grandmaster Miguel Illescas. This resulted in an awkward situation in the final round of the 2011 Spanish championship, when the couple found themselves paired against each other with the national title at stake. They agreed a quick draw, allowing Alvar Alonso Rosell to catch Illescas and claim the title on tie-break. She has won the women's Ukrainian Chess Championship in 2004, and the women's Spanish Chess Championship in 2013. She has competed twice in the Women's World Chess Championship."

  "text" : "Oswald Jozef Leroy (Passendale, Belgium, 1936) is a Belgian mathematician known for his contributions to theoretical acousto-optics. Leroy's biggest achievement was a theoretical study of the interaction of light with two adjacent ultrasonic beams under different conditions in terms of beam shape, frequency content and intensity. Understanding of this phenomenon was very important in the 1970s when new acousto-optic devices were developed (mainly due to novel developments in laser technology) that utilized adjacent ultrasonic beams. Such devices were being used in optical modulators, optical scanners, information processing, optical filtering and frequency-spectrum analysis. Before his contribution only the interaction of light with one ultrasonic beam was understood. Since then, acousto-optic devices have been used in telecommunication and military applications."

  "text" : "Oleksandr Valeriyovych Zakharuk (Ukrainian: Олександр Валерійович Захарук; born August 25, 1976 in Kiev) is a retired amateur Ukrainian freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's featherweight category. Considered as one of the world's top freestyle wrestlers in his decade, Zakharuk had claimed five European championship titles, picked up three bronze medals at the World Championships (1999, 2002, and 2003), and achieved top eight finishes in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Zakharuk trained as a member of the freestyle wrestling team for Ukraina Kiev Sport Club, under his coach Serhiy Obesnyuk. Zakharuk entered the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, as a top medal contender, in the men's bantamweight category (54 kg), after claiming a bronze from the 1999 World Wrestling Championships in Ankara, Turkey. During the preliminary pool, Zakharuk pinned neighboring Russia's Leonid Chuchunov on his opening bout, and then eclipsed Bulgaria's Ivan Tsonov with a powerful effort and a 10-point advantage to earn him a spot for the quarterfinals. Followed by the next morning's session, Zakharuk fell behind U.S. wrestler and 1998 world champion Sammie Henson with a score 4–8, before he sought a chance to fight back in a consolation battle against Kazakhstan's Maulen Mamyrov for a fifth-place finish. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Zakharuk qualified for his second Ukrainian squad, as a 28-year-old, in the men's featherweight class (55 kg) with another brilliant sporting record. After the abolition of the bantamweight division in amateur wrestling that propelled him to fight at least a single kilogram heavier than in 2000, Zakharuk picked up his third career bronze medal in the men's featherweight category at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, which earned him a spot on the Ukrainian Olympic team. He continued to deliver a more stellar performance from Sydney four years earlier by pinning Kazakhstan's Baurzhan Orazgaliyev and overpowering Belarusian wrestler and 2001 world champion Herman Kantoyeu to seize another shot of an Olympic medal. Fighting against Russia's Mavlet Batirov in the quarterfinal match, Zakharuk could not score a single point to push him off the mat, and instead, managed to finish only in seventh at the end of the tournament."

  "text" : "Ole Edvard Borgen (8 November 1925 – 24 March 2009) was a Norwegian theologian and Methodist bishop. He was born in Lillestrøm as a son of meat merchant Omar Emil Borgen (1900–1985) and Harda Pytte (1901–1989), and older brother of Peder Borgen. In June 1949 he married Martha Olava Rygge (1928–2003). He attended Tomb Agricultural School from 1944 to 1946, and also completed an apprenticeship in sausage making, intent to take over his father's store and the family farm. He was elected to Lillestrøm city council, serving from 1950 to 1956. Besides that, the entire family adhered to the Methodist creed, and in 1956 Borgen travelled to the United States to study different subjects. From 1959 to 1962 he was a choir leader and pastor for youths in Edgemont Baptist Church, Durham, and from 1963 he was a pastor at West Side Avenue Methodist Church in Jersey City. In 1968 he took his doctorate at Drew University with the thesis John Wesley on the Sacraments. A Theological Study. He had then been stationed in Stockholm since 1966, as an aide to the Methodist bishop to the Nordic countries, Odd Hagen. After a spell as secretary at the Methodist World Council office in Geneva, Borgen served as the Methodist bishop to the Nordic countries from 1970 to 1989. He was a delegate to the World Council of Churches and became president of the Council of Methodist Bishops, as the first non-American. He rounded off his career as a professor of systematic theology at Asbury Theological Seminary from 1989 to 1992. He died in March 2009 in Lørenskog."

  "text" : "O Song-nam (Korean: 오성남; born July 16, 1982 in Pyongyang) is a retired amateur North Korean freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's featherweight category. He finished sixth in the 55-kg division at the 2004 Asian Wrestling Championships in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and later represented his nation North Korea at the Summer Olympics a few months later. O also trained for the national wrestling team, under his personal coach Ri Ho-jin. O qualified as a lone wrestler for the North Korean squad in the men's featherweight class (55 kg) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by receiving a wildcard invitation from the International Federation of Associated Wrestling (FILA). He lost his opening match 3–4 to the host nation's Amiran Kardanov, much to the delight of the home crowd inside Ano Liossa Olympic Hall. Despite a single defeat, O rallied his stretch to edge Armenia's Martin Berberyan off the mat (5–2), and then awarded a free pass to score another triumph, when his other opponent Harun Doğan did not show up on the final bout because of sustained injuries. Finishing second in the prelim pool and eighth overall, O's performance was not enough to advance him to the quarterfinals."

He was born in Porsgrunn as a son of assurance director Olaf Karenius Abrahamsen (1853–1936) and Caroline Marie Halvorsen (1855–1925). In July 1915 in Hemne he married painter Signy Hassel, a sister of architect Kaspar F. Hassel. In 1916 he changed his last name to Willums. He originally worked as an engineer, graduating from Skiensfjorden Mechanical Vocational School in 1904 and a technical college in Germany in 1907. He worked as a turbine constructor at Amme Giesecke & Konegen in Braunschweig from 1908 to 1912. He then attended the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts from 1912 to 1913 and the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry from 1913 to 1915. From 1919 to 1945 he was a teacher at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts. He has been described as \"a very popular teacher for a whole generation of Norwegian printmakers\". Willums was also active in artists' organizations. He co-founded the Association of Norwegian Printmakers in 1919, served as vice chairman and then chairman from 1925 to 1929. As a painter he debuted at the Statens kunstutstilling in 1913, and also at the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition. He had separate exhibitions in Oslo, Copenhagen and London, and was later invited to exhibit in numerous cities worldwide. In addition to paintings he did etchings, woodcuts, lithography and chalcography. The National Gallery of Norway owns two paintings and some woodcuts, and his chalcographics were bought by Kupferstichkabinett, Dresden, British Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum. He also made several ex libris. During the German occupation of Norway he was a member of the Temporary Consultative Arts Council from November 1940 till 1942, and then of the Cultural Assembly (Norwegian: Kulturtinget) until the war's end. He was a member of the Fascist political party Nasjonal Samling. In 1944 he issued a book on partyfellow and painter Søren Onsager. After the Second World War, he dedicated himself to painting. In 1958 he finally managed to exhibit the series of seven grand paintings, Draumkvædet, on which he had worked for thirty years. Draumkvædet is owned by Porsgrunn municipality. He died in February 1967 in Eidanger."

From 1875 to 1879 he studied philology, classical archaeology and Egyptology at the University of Strasbourg, where his instructors included Adolf Michaelis, Rudolf Schöll and Johannes Dümichen. Later on, via a grant from the German Archaeological Institute (DAI), he conducted studies of ancient sculptures in Alexandria and Cairo (1881–83). In 1883, on behalf of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, with Carl Humann and Felix von Luschan, he took part in an expedition to Nemrud Dagi, where he visited the tomb of Antiochus I Theos of Commagene. In 1889 he received his habilitation in Berlin. With Robert Koldewey, he conducted research of Greek temples in southern Italy and Sicily (1892 & 1893/94), and in 1895, investigated the ancient walled city of Paestum (southern Italy). During the following year, he succeeded Franz Studniczka as chair of classical archaeology at the University of Freiburg (1896). In 1900 he undertook an expedition to Baalbek, and in 1907, with Ludwig Curtius and others, travelled to the excavation site of the Hittite capital of Hattusa. In 1910 he took a trip to North Africa in order to study the Roman cities of Lambaesis and Timgad."

  "text" : "Oswald Philip Lancashire (10 December 1857 – 23 July 1934) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Lancashire, Cambridge University and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), plus other amateur sides, between 1878 and 1888. He was also a successful Association football player. He was born at Newton Heath, Manchester and died at West Didsbury, also in Manchester. Lancashire was educated at Lancing College and at Jesus College, Cambridge. He won a Cambridge Blue for football in 1878, 1879 and 1880, when he captained the team against Oxford University; in all three years, Cambridge won the university match. As a cricketer where he played as a right-handed batsman, often appearing in the lower middle-order, Lancashire played for both Cambridge University and for the county side of Lancashire in 1878 and 1879 without much success. In 1880, he passed 50 for the first time in making an innings of 60 for Cambridge against the \"Gentlemen of England\" side in a high-scoring match. He was then awarded his cricket Blue, and in the 1880 University match he made 5 and 29 as a strong Cambridge team beat Oxford by 115 runs. Lancashire was still at Cambridge in 1881 but though he played a few more matches for the university cricket team he did not do well enough to win a second Blue. After leaving Cambridge, Lancashire continued to play county cricket fairly regularly for the next half dozen years without ever making much of an impact: in 1886, for example, he played in 19 first-class matches, all but one of them for the Lancashire county team, but he averaged only 10.03 with the bat and his highest score that year was just 49. In 1884, he scored 119 for Lancashire in a non-first-class game against Cheshire. But his highest first-class score was an innings of 76 against MCC in 1885, when he was left undefeated when Lancashire won the match by eight wickets. He did not play first-class cricket after the 1888 season. Unmarried, Lancashire appears to have had no profession or occupation and to have been of \"independent means\". He was a Justice of the Peace for Lancashire from 1887. He was chairman of Lancashire County Cricket Club from 1913 to 1927 and president in 1923-24."

  "text" : "Otto Young (December 20, 1844 – November 30, 1906) was a German American merchant and real estate mogul from Elberfeld, Prussia. After his father died in his youth, Young struggled to earn enough money to follow his mother to the United States. After he did, he sold toys on the streets of New York City before attending some school. He then worked as a clerk in a cigar store, eventually amassing enough money to open a jewelry store. The store was very successful and Young moved west to establish a new store in Chicago, Illinois. With the earnings from his Chicago store, Young purchased a half interest in The Fair Store. The value of the store skyrocketed afterward and Young became wealthy. He maintained several interests in real estate, including the Heyworth Building, and served on the board of trustees of the First National Bank of Chicago. Young was also a philanthropist, and often donated to the Chicago Home for Incurables in memory of his son. Young's estate in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin is today recognized on the National Register of Historic Places."

  "text" : "O. E. L. Graves (1897 - 1971) was an American artist and painter/sculptor based in Palm Springs, California during Hollywood's golden years. His client list included many of the rich and famous of his era, from movie stars (Clark Gable, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Janet Gaynor) to business magnates (Raymond Loewys, George R. Hearst Sr.) to shady criminal kingpins. His own personal life was just as full of high intrigue and secrecy as the famous clients he cultivated. As a result, his need to maintain a relatively low profile in his private life has relegated him to near obscurity in death as an artist. Graves experimented constantly with new media and techniques for expressing his art. His works include delicate watercolors, fine detailed portraits, impressionistic oils, sculptures in metal, and some techniques of his own invention. Graves claims to have invented \"sculpted oil painting\", where multiple layers of thick oil paint are placed on masonite and then cut away to create the image. His sculpted oil paintings were displayed in some of the trendiest galleries and art museums, including the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, which purchased some of his sculpted paintings after they had been shown there. Winthrop Rockefeller tried to purchase Grave's favorite sculpted painting from him (Ptolemy's Daughters) for a very tidy sum, only to be refused by the artist, who wouldn't part with it. Born in London, Ontario (Canada), Graves had a strong interest in Native Americans throughout his career, which is reflected in many of his paintings. While still a youth, he became a full member of the Sarcee Indian tribe after many years of association with its people. He was also a cowpuncher, rodeo rider, and trick roper, able to throw a 100-foot circle of rope and lasso eight horses at once. He rode in the famed Calgary Stampede, displaying his cowboy skills. He had developed an interest in drawing as a boy and drew pastel sketches on sandpaper even during his cowboy days. During World War I, he was a fighter pilot with the Royal Flying Corps. After the war, he came to the United States to work as a commercial artist. During World War II, he worked as a designer of airplanes and guided missiles with North American Aviation. After World War II, Graves moved to Palm Springs, California to illustrate covers for The Palm Springs Villager magazine, a local publication in the famous celebrity town. Palm Springs then became his base of operations for a successful career as a fine artist. After his death in 1971, court battles erupted for his estate between his wife and his mistress. During the hearings, it was discovered that O.E.L. Graves had another legal wife in Canada. In exasperation, and to recover back taxes due, the court finally awarded his remaining unsold artwork to the state of California. Immetta Davis purchased the entire collection from the state at auction. Achilles Fine Arts and Antiques in Palm Springs, owned by Jack Louis Midling, then purchased half of the works from Immetta Davis."

She was booked to perform at the Calgary Spoken Word Festival in the summer of 2014.

Sedakova was born in Moscow and graduated from Moscow State University (faculty of philology) in 1973. Subsequently, she went to graduate school. In 1985, she obtained a degree of Candidate of Sciences (philology). She befriended Venedikt Yerofeyev and kept the manuscript of Moscow-Petushki in her house. A deeply religious person, Sedakova started writing poetry in 1960. The Christian subject matter made her Neoclassical works unpublishable in the Soviet Union until 1989. As of 2014, she has authored seven books of poetry. Her poems were translated into a number of languages including English, French, German, and Italian. It was through her mentor Sergei Averintsev that Sedakova became involved in the ecumenist movement. She is known to have exchanged poetry collections with John Paul II who presented the inaugural Vladimir Solovyov Prize to her (1998). She also criticised the Russian Orthodox Church for taking an intolerant stance on other forms of Christian faith. Sedakova is the recipient of several major literary prizes, including Andrei Bely Prize (1983), European Prize in Poetry (1995), and Solzhenitsyn Prize (2001)."

She grew up in Cairo, but eventually fled when the Nasser regime came to power. Her most famous work is Ramza, and while it is considered fiction, many scholars view portions of it through an autobiographical lens. Because of her extensive travels to Europe, (France in particular), Kouloub was very well received abroad. Her work was demanded by many cultures. All of her books were written in French and some have been translated into English, German, Arabic, Dutch, and Indonesian."

After he died in June 1934, Peterson assisted Goren \"especially at bridge teachers' conventions\"; \"in seminars for 35 years\". Peterson and Maud Zontlein were the first winners of the Whitehead Trophy in 1930, the national championship for women pairs that continues as the Whitehead Women's Pairs (North America-level in the ACBL). With different partners she won again in 1932 (Mrs. Jay Jones) and 1945 (Peggy Golder), placed second in 1935 (Doris Fuller). In the Hilliard Mixed Pairs, then the premier tournament for mixed pairs (male–female), she was 1942 runner-up with John R. Crawford and 1943 winner with Goren. In women teams-of-four, she was a winner in 1938 and 1942, a runner-up four times from 1948 to 1954 – perhaps in partnership with Peggy Golder/Solomon from 1942 onward (Women's Board-a-Match Teams). In mixed teams, she was a winner four times from 1940 to 1944 and a runner-up in 1952 (Master Mixed Teams). She was Master Individual runner-up in 1942; women were winners only twice, runners-up only twice, in thirty renditions before that individuals championship was discontinued. Peterson and Margaret Wagar became ACBL Life Masters number 36 and 37 in 1943, the fourth and fifth women to achieve the rank after Sally Young, Helen Sobel, and Peggy Solomon. Peterson's husband was Pete Peterson. She died in Philadelphia, probably February 11, 1965. At the time she was reported to be 66 or 67 years old."
