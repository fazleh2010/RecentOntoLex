  "text" : "Pauline Wilhelmine Rasmussen Schmidt (1865-1944), was a professional Danish magician and photographer. She was one of very few females in her profession during her career. Pauline Schmidt was a successful magician and a well known and appreciated artist in Sweden and Finland during the 1880s. In 1888, she married the Finnish photographer Niels Rasmussen and became his colleague in Tampere. She opened her own studio in 1914. During the 19th-century, female magicians were extremely rare and she was somewhat of an exception in her profession. As a career as a professional magician was considered shameful by the norms of the day, however, her former profession was never mentioned after she had retired. Pauline Schmidt is portrayed in the novel Pauline Wilhelmine – trollkonstnärinna (Pauline Wilhelmine – a female magician), by Elisabeth Sandelin (2013)."

  "text" : "Philip Tannura (March 28, 1897 – December 7, 1973) was an American cinematographer who worked on over a hundred films during his career. Tannura also directed and acted in several short films and worked on a number of Three Stooges shorts as cinematographer. Tannura spent much of his career making mid to low-budget films for a variety of different Hollywood studios. In the early 1930s he went to London to work in the booming British film industry. He was able to work on more expensive, quality productions during these years including several films produced by the Hungarian-born tycoon Max Schach. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, he returned to America. In 1941, he was cinematographer for the Rita Hayworth and Fred Astaire musical You'll Never Get Rich. Generally much of his later work, often at Columbia Pictures, was on film series such as the Lone Wolf and The Whistler. From the early 1950s to the end of his career, he worked in television."

  "text" : "Patrick A. Duffy (July 1934 – 1996), known as Paddy Duffy, was an Irish nationalist politician. Born in Stewartstown, County Tyrone, Duffy studied at St Patrick's Academy in Dungannon and then Queen's University Belfast before becoming a solicitor. He became politically active in the Nationalist Party, then in the Unity movement, acting as agent for Frank McManus, the successful candidate in Fermanagh and South Tyrone at the 1970 general election. After the election, Duffy was a key founder member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and served as its first treasurer. He was elected to Cookstown District Council at the Northern Ireland local elections, 1973, and then at the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election he won a seat in Mid Ulster, which he successfully defended on the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975. He also retained his council seat in 1977 and 1981. However, he proved less successful on the national stage, taking second place in Mid Ulster at the 1979 general election. In the late 1970s, Duffy became known for his outspoken support of Northern Irish independence, although he did concede that there would need to be some form of federal structure covering the entire island. He objected to the arrangements for the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election, refused to stand, and unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the SDLP to boycott the election, and called for its assembly members to withdraw after Seamus Mallon was disqualified. Following this, he withdrew from involvement in the SDLP, although he was re-elected as a nominal party member to Cookstown District Council in 1985 and 1989. Outside politics, Duffy built up a large legal practice, with offices in small towns across Northern Ireland. He was also active in the credit union and co-operative movements. At the time of his death in 1996, he was a member of the board of the International Fund for Ireland."

  "text" : "Peter Chartier (1690—c.1759) (Anglicized version of Pierre Chartier, sometimes written Chartiere, Chartiers, Shartee or Shortive) was a fur trader of French and Shawnee parentage who became a tribal chief and was an early advocate for Native American civil rights, speaking out against the sale of alcohol in indigenous communities in Pennsylvania. He first attempted to limit the sale of rum in Shawnee communities in the Province of Pennsylvania, then launched a movement to prohibit it altogether. Conflict with the colonial government motivated him to lead his community of over 400 Pekowi Shawnees on a four-year odyssey through Ohio, Kentucky, Alabama and Indiana, eventually resettling in Illinois. He later fought on the side of the French during the French and Indian War. Two communities (Chartiers Township and Chartiers (Pittsburgh)), several rivers including Chartiers Creek, Chartiers Run (Allegheny River) and Chartiers Run (Chartiers Creek), and two school districts (Chartiers-Houston School District and Chartiers Valley School District) are named after him."

Self received his undergraduate degree in 1981 from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. In 1984, he procured his law degree from Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge.

Self is affiliated with the National Association for Court Management and the American Judges Association. He teaches at the North Louisiana Criminal Justice Academy in Plain Dealing in Bossier Parish. On October 19, 1991, Self ran as a Democrat for the District 37 seat in the Louisiana State Senate, encompassing Caddo and Bossier parishes. The position opened when Sydney B. Nelson, also a Shreveport attorney, retired after three terms. In the nonpartisan blanket primary, another DemocratGregory J. Barro of Shreveport led the field with 11,224 votes (34 percent). Republican Ronald Bradford \"Ron\" Fayard (October 1, 1946 – March 7, 2011), a Mississippi native, real estate broker, and civic leader from Bossier City, trailed with 10,228 votes (31 percent). Self finished a strong third with 29 percent of the vote. A second Republican candidate, Shreveport attorney Leroy Havard Scott, Jr. (1922-2003), a former member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee, held the remaining 5.5 percent of the ballots cast.Barro subsequently defeated Fayard in the general election. In a special election for his newly-created judgeship held on October 4, 2003, Self, still a Democrat, defeated the Republican candidate, \"Ted\" Johnson, 18,962 (54.2 percent) to 16,035 (45.8 percent). Self since switched his party registration to Republican. His court colleagues include Jeff R. Thompson, Charles Jacobs, Mike Nerren, Michael Craig, and Jeff Cox. Self and fellow Republicans Nerren, Craig, and Cox were all unopposed in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on November 4, 2014. Jacobs ran without opposition to succeed John M. Robinson; Thompson to succeed Ford E. Stinson, Jr.Self will become the senior judge of the six-member court in January 2015.

  "text" : "Peter K. Machamer (born October 20, 1942) is an American philosopher and historian of science. Machamer is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh. His work has been influential in philosophy of science in developing an account of mechanistic explanation which rejects standard deductive models of explanation, such as the deductive-nomological model by understanding scientific practice as the search for mechanisms. His research has also focused on 17th-century history of philosophy and science, on Galileo Galilei and René Descartes in particular, and on values and science. He was also a wine columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for fifteen years, and he has reflected on wine and beer in philosophical writing. Machamer is also the \"Philosopher in Residence\" for the Pittsburgh dance company Attack Theater."

  "text" : "Phil Donkin (born November 1980 in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear) is a British Jazz bassist. Donkin began playing electric bass at 12 years old. At 17 he unsuccessfully auditioned for the then vacant bass player position in the British band Jamiroquai. At 19 he then moved to London to study at the prestigious Guildhall School of Music and Drama where he completed a degree in Music. It was here that he began playing the acoustic bass, where this became the instrument he played exclusively. After graduating in 2003, Donkin was active in the London Jazz scene. He worked with many great UK musicians such as Kenny Wheeler, Julian Arguelles, Tim Garland, Stan Sulzmann and Gwilym Simcock. In the years that followed, Donkin's reputation had spread beyond the UK and he toured Europe with people such as John Abercrombie, Marc Copland, Bill Stewart, Greg Osby, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Chris Speed, Ari Hoenig, Jonathan Kreisberg, Terrell Stafford, David Binney, Tyshawn Sorey and many others. He also performed with some jazz legends such as Quincy Jones, Roger Kellaway and Eddie Henderson. In 2010, Donkin moved to New York City where he furthered these musical relationships and began many new ones, playing with artists such as Ben Monder, Kevin Hays, Adam Rogers, Mark Turner, Seamus Blake, Steve Cardenas, Bruce Barth, Edward Simon and many others. As of 2013, Donkin is based in both Germany and New York. Donkin is a member of many projects in Europe, such as Dhafer Youssef's 'Bird's Requiem' featuring Eivind Aarseth and Nils Petter Molvear. He is a member of Rainer Böhm's trio, and a collaborative quartet featuring Pablo Held, Johannes Enders and Nasheet Waits. He also plays regularly with Nils Wogram's 'Root 70', Marius Neset's 'Birds' quartet, the Ben Kraef Trio and the Max von Mosch Tentet. Donkin has led projects as a band leader, releasing the album Dimaxis in 2006  and the Album The Gate in 2015. Donkin has played on over 50 recordings as a sideman both in Europe and the U.S, on various labels."

He is Belgium's most successful athlete at the Summer Paralympics, having won seven gold medals in athletics between 1980 and 1988. In his first Paralympics in 1980, he was a gold medallist in the 4 × 100 m relay (category 2–5) and the category 3 slalom. Two further golds followed in 1984, this time in the 400 m 1500 m. He was also the silver medallist in the 100 m and 200 m sprint events, as well as taking a bronze in the category 3 slalom. Van Winkel medalled in all the events he entered in 1988: he was first in the 400 m, 800 m and 5000 m wheelchair races, and was the runner-up in the 200 m and the 1500 m. In his fourth and final Paralympic Games in 1992, he came close to further medals with a fourth place in the 800 m and fifth in the 200 m. He did not make the 400 m final and failed to finish in the 5000 m, making his last appearance one without medals. He twice medalled in the demonstration wheelchair race at the Olympics, winning the inaugural event in 1984 and coming runner-up four years later. He has also competed outside of Olympic competition and took three consecutive victories at Grandma's Marathon in two separate streaks. He encouraged fellow marathon racer Marcelo Ordaz-Cruz to enter the sport, after Ordaz-Cruz became paralysed due to a gunshot wound. Van Winkel now lives in Minnesota."

He was the brother of Franz Osten and Ottmar Ostermayr. In 1907 they took over their father's photography business and turned into a film studio. After serving in the First World War he founded a company which later evolved into Bavaria Film, and acquired the Emelka Studios in Munich. While Bavaria went on to become a leading German production company, Ostermayr had left by the mid-1920s and worked at several other studios including the giant UFA. Following the Second World War he entered independent production, and specialised in heimatfilm. He was made an honorary president of the West German Film Producers' Association. His son was the film director Paul May."

  "text" : "Patricia L. Brown (born October 1, 1928) was the first female chemical engineer to graduate from Southwestern Louisiana Institute. She was one out of a total of two female chemical engineers at Stephan Company in 1993. Brown served as the president and a lifelong active member of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) from 1961 to 1963. She co-founded the Detroit section of SWE in 1952. She was one of the first members, a Charter Member, of the South Ohio SWE section. When she arrived in Dallas, there was no regional section of SWE, so she kept in touch at the national level. You can’t be everything to everybody, but the fact that some women didn’t need us didn’t mean that there weren’t an awful lot more women who did. – Patricia Brown She was a key Member in helping keep SWE afloat in the late 1950s, when money was scarce and membership was low. While Brown was president of SWE, she worked with Lillian Moller Gilbreth to help advance SWE's goals to encourage women engineers to succeed. As president, because of a minor miscommunication, Brown presented an honorary award to Marlene Schmidt, a German engineer who was also Miss Universe at the time. She attempted to persuade Grace Hopper to help SWE's cause as well, but Hopper did not believe in a separate society for women."

  "text" : "(Not to be confused with the Worcestershire and Oxford University wicket-keeper Philip John Whitcombe (born 1928).) Philip Arthur Whitcombe (23 April 1923 – 11 August 2015) was a first-class cricketer who played in England from 1947 to 1960. He was educated at Winchester, where he was a contemporary of Hubert Doggart, a future England cricketer. During the war he served with the Royal Horse Artillery before going up to Christ Church, Oxford. He played in the Oxford University team from 1947 to 1949 and won a Blue three years running. He worked for P&O as a shipping agent, while working in India, when he met his wife-to-be, Rosemary, daughter of Lord Clydesmuir, the last Governor of Bombay. His most notable season was 1948, when he took 47 wickets at an average of 15.93. In Oxford's match against Yorkshire he bowled Len Hutton in each innings, finishing with figures of 5 for 32 and 2 for 33. In the University Match he played a large part in Oxford's innings victory: \"Well-maintained length at fast-medium pace with the pavilion as background, coming from such a high delivery as that of the six feet four inches tall Whitcombe, seemed beyond interpretation by the Cambridge students, and in taking seven wickets for 51 runs he influenced the proceedings to such an extent that the other Oxford bowlers invariably checked any suggestion of easy scoring.\" A few days later he opened the bowling for the Gentlemen, taking the wickets of Cyril Washbrook (twice) and Denis Compton. A few days after that, playing only his second match for Middlesex, he dismissed Bill Brown and Don Bradman to leave the touring Australians 28 for 2. He played no more county cricket after 1948, and after the university season ended in 1949 he played no first-class cricket until 1954, when he began playing occasionally for Free Foresters. He was a captain in the Royal Artillery. He and his wife Rosemary (1927-2009), daughter of John Colville, 1st Baron Clydesmuir, had a son and a daughter. His father, Major-General Philip Sidney Whitcombe, played some first-class cricket while serving in India, and also played for Berkshire."

  "text" : "Pieskaret (pees-ka'-ret) (died 1647) was a famous chief of the Adirondac Indians. His tribe fought against English forces helping French in the early 17th century. Adirondacs under him drove the Iroquois Confederation out of Canada. Pieskaret is reported to have distinguished himself by going at night just by himself into an Iroquois village, where he hid himself during the day, and for three successive nights attacked and scalped the members of a tribal lodge. He was killed in 1647 when he encountered a large band of Iroquois. Pieskaret. The Algonkin name, often written Piskater, of a noted Algonkin (Adirondack) chief, who lived on the N. bank of the river St. Lawrence, below Montreal, in the first half of the 17 th century. According to Schoolcraft ( W. Scenes and Remin ., 87,1853) the dialectic form in his own tribe was Bisconace ('Little Blaze'). Although he became noted by reason of his daring, comparatively few incidents of his life have been recorded. Charlevoix (New France, II, 181, 1866) says he was \"one of the bravest men ever seen in Canada, and almost incredible stories are told of his prowess.\" His most noted exploit occurred during an excursion into the Iroquois country with but four followers, well armed with guns, when they encountered on Richelieu r., in five boats, a band of 50 Iroquois, most of whom they killed or captured. On another occasion Pieskaret ventured alone within the Iroquois domain, and coming to one of their villages, by secreting himself during the day, succeeded in killing and scalping the members of a household each night for three successive nights. He was ultimately brought under the influence of Catholic missionaries and in 1641 was baptized under the name Simon, after which he was commonly known among the whites as Simon Pieskaret. After his acceptance of Christianity so much confidence was placed in his prudence and ability that he was commissioned to maintain peace between the French and the Indians, as well as between the Hurons and Algonkin; he was authorized to punish delinquents, \"and especially those who committed any fault against religion. It is wonderful how he discharged his office.\" (Jes. Rel. 1647, XXXI 287, 1898.) He was present and made a speech at the conference between the French governor and the Iroquois and other tribes at Trois-Rivières, Quebec, in 1645. Two years later, while a large body of Iroquois were going on a pretended visit to the governor some of their scouts met Pieskaret near Nicolet, r., and treacherously killed him while he was off his guard."

  "text" : "Ender Petru Sudureac (born June 23, 1974 in Botoşani) is a retired amateur Romanian Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's heavyweight category. Sudureac has claimed a silver medal in the 97-kg division at the 1995 World Wrestling Championships, and later represented his nation Romania in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Sudureac trained as part of the Greco-Roman wrestling team for Dinamo Bucureşti, under his coach Nicolae Zamfir. Sudureac first emerged into the international scene at the 1995 World Wrestling Championships in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where he won the silver medal on his final match against Turkey's Hakkı Başar in the 90-kg division. He also sought his bid to compete at the 1996 Summer Olympics in the same venue from the World Championships, but was shortlisted. Destined to fulfill his goal and Olympic dream, Sudureac was selected to be part of the Romanian Olympic team, and ultimately made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's heavyweight division (97 kg). He lost his opening match to the formidable Swedish wrestler Mikael Ljungberg, but managed to beat Bulgaria's Ali Mollov in the prelim pool with a score of 6–1. Finishing second in the elimination round and eleventh overall, Sudureac fell short of his chance to put him further into the quarterfinals. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Sudureac qualified for his second team, as a 31-year-old veteran, in the men's 96 kg class by finishing third and receiving a berth from the third Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Fighting against Iran's Masoud Hashemzadeh and Lithuania's Mindaugas Ežerskis in the prelim pool, Sudureac could not be able to produce a satisfactory record from Sydney, as he lost two straight matches and ended his Olympic campaign with a fifteenth overall finish."

Pecha represented his nation Slovakia in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), and also achieved a top 5 finish in the 130-kg division at the 2000 European Wrestling Championships in Budapest. Throughout his sporting career, Pecha trained as part of the freestyle wrestling team for AŠK Dukla Trenčín, under his longtime coach and mentor Petr Hirjak. Pecha made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's super heavyweight division (130 kg). He lost his opening bout against Germany's Sven Thiele with a technical superiority, and could not fight for the following match against Russia's David Musulbes, who later took home the Olympic gold in the final, because of a hip injury sustained from the previous match. At the preliminary competition, Pecha finished in third place but sixteenth in overall final rankings; he was severely injured during the Games. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Pecha qualified for the Slovak squad, as a 29-year-old, in the men's heavyweight class (96 kg) by receiving a berth from the second Olympic Qualification Tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria. Pecha could not beat China's Wang Yuanyuan into the ring on his opening duel, but managed to redeem himself by eclipsing the host nation's Alexandros Laliotis in his second match. Pecha finished the preliminary competition second, and twelfth in overall rankings; he did not advance to the quarterfinals."

  "text" : "Pieter Erberveld (ca. 1660 – April 14, 1722) was a Eurasian resident of Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta), the headquarters of the VOC in Asia, during the 17th and early 18th centuries who was accused of plotting a rebellion with Javanese for January 1, 1722, but was captured and executed, and a monument erected where his house had stood. Although he is often described as half-Javanese, or half-Dutch, Pieter Erberveld was the son a German (Westfalian) father, a tanner of hides, and Siamese Christian mother. He was born around 1660 in the Siamese kingdom of Ayuthya. When his father moved the family to Batavia, he had them all baptized in November 1671. Erberveld was among the more wealthy residents of Batavia, although he was not a VOC employee. In the early 18th century, he had a dispute with the VOC authorities about his inheritance, which may have played a role in later events. In 1721, he was accused of plotting a rebellion with thousands of Javanese, with the goal of establishing an Islamic state, but was arrested at his residence with a small number of people, tortured, and executed. The monument which was erected on the site of his residence featured a concrete or plaster skull on a spike (which was rumored to be real), and carried a plaque stating that no one should ever build or plant on this site again. This monument remained in its original location on the Jacatraweg until the Japanese demolished it in early 1942, as one of their efforts to rid Indonesia of the Dutch and the colonial atmosphere, but even Japanese visitors had been regularly taken to visit the monument in prewar years. After the war, the monument was rebuilt, before being moved again to the Taman Prasasti Museum in Tanah Abang. Pieter Erberveld was locally relatively well known, and is sometimes referred to as Pangeran Pecah Kulit (broken skin prince) either because of the means of his death (drawing and quartering) or more likely from the local area's nickname, derived from the presence of a tannery in the area. Numerous stories about Erberveld have circulated in Indonesian society since at least 1888, including a novel published in 1924 by Tio Ie Soei and one version of the story about his was made into a TV drama in the 1980s. The spelling of Pieter Erberveld varies in different sources, including Pieter Erbervelt and Pieter Elberveld."

  "text" : "Paul Anthony Christie (born 1951) is an American voice actor. He was born and raised in Manhattan. Over his long career Paul has worked as an artist, writer, narrator, and comedian, as well as an voice actor. In the 70's Paul was a contributing editor for Crawdaddy magazine. In the 1980s he performed stand up in and around New York and was a founding member of the improvisational group The House Band. His graphic artwork was well known in New York through Kid Christie, the company he co-founded with Theresa Fiorentino. As a writer Paul co-wrote the albums \"Midnight at the Lost and Found\", and \"Blind before I Stop\" for the rock star Meatloaf. He is probably best known over the past 35 years as a voice artist. Over his career Paul has done thousands of commercials for clients including Chrysler, Dominoes, Pontiac, Canon, Calvin Klein and Budweiser. His award winning role as \"Louie the Lizard\" for Budweiser, became an advertising legend. Paul's career in animation and children's video and television is far reaching. Recently he created the character of Vinnie, the wise guy panda, for Fox's Biscuits in England. At home in the U.S., he created the character of Zook for CTW's \"Zook and Allison\". Some other well known roles include Carr in Adult Swim's \"Stroker and Hoop\", and the handsome Ram in Disney's \"Brother Bear\". As a narrator Paul has worked extensively for Discovery, the Nature series on PBS, as well as A&E, History, Biography, and many others. For Nature, his credits include the six part series \"Deep Jungle\", as well as \"Owl Power\", \"Killers in Eden\", and \"Can Animals Predict Disaster\" among others. Presently he narrates both long running Discovery series \"Gold Rush\", and \"Dual Survival\". His true home away from home though has been Nickelodeon. In the 90's Paul voiced Stick Stickly for Nick's ground breaking \"Nick in the Afternoon\" created by Agi Fodor and Karen Kufflick. Stick endures to this day as Nick is currently celebrating its 20th anniversary. On Nick Jr. (formerly Noggin) Paul voiced the beloved Moose A. Moose from 2003 until 2012, and just voiced the new Nick app for kids online. Paul Christie was also the NY President of the Screen Actors Guild from 2003-2007. During that same time frame he also served as the 2nd National Vice President of the Guild. He served on the Board of Directors from 2000-2009."

  "text" : "Pablo Dolores Regino is a Mexican laquer artisan from Temalacatzingo, Guerrero. He began learning traditional lacquer techniques when he was a small child and today he runs one of the most important workshops in his small town in an area known for lacquer ware. Dolores Regino’s creations are made from a variety of gourd called cucurbita, which has a hard shell especially when dried, and comes in a variety of shapes and sizes which he uses to create various figures and objects. Finished products include toys such as carrousels, Ferris wheels, animal figures (birds, fish, armadillos etc.) as well as boxes and other storage containers for small items such as sewing supplies and jewelry. He also makes nativity scenes. Dolores Regino works with his son-in-law Julio Santos at their workshop and property where the crafts are made from growing the gourds to the finished product. After the various sizes and types of gourd are harvested, the insides are cleaned out and the hard shell is left to dry. The outer shell is lacquered with chia (preferably), linseed or other oil, and then painted with tlapilole, a powder with coloring that serves as the base. The piece is then burnished to make sure the tlapilole is well-set and the process is repeated to make sure the gourd is well sealed. After drying, the piece is ready to be decorated, usually with traditional floral designs of Guerrero. The designs tend to be less dense than those of neighboring Olinalá and usually include animals such as birds, rabbits, deer, owls and more. The colors are made from earth and other natural pigments mixed with chia or linseed oil. The artisan has been able to market his goods in other parts of Mexico, exhibiting it in venues such as the Palace of Iturbide in Mexico City. In 2001, the Fomento Cultural Banamex named him a “Grand Master” of Mexican folk art and in 2010, his work “Diablo” won honorable mention at the seventh “Living Legends” (Leyendas vivientes) event sponsored by FONART."

  "text" : "P. Venu (Malayalam: പി. വേണു, 8 November 1940 – 25 May 2011) was an Indian film director, producer and screenwriter with over 20 films to his credit. His directorial venture Udhyogastha in 1967 was the first ever multi-starrer film of South India. His work in Malayalam cinema was significant and most influential, covering all themes and genres over a career spanning 40 years. One of his most recognized film C.I.D. Nazir in 1971, revolutionized movie-making in the investigative genre in Malayalam cinema. Following the commercial and critical success of this film, he came up with two more in the series - Taxi Car in 1972 and Prethangalude Thazhvara in 1973, which were recognized as the first investigative sequels in the history of Malayalam cinema. From the late 60s to the 90s he continued to make films and then decided to take a break to devote more time to his family. His last film Parinamam (The Change) in 2003 won an honour for Malayalam cinema, winning the Best Screenplay Award at Ashdod International Film Festival held in Israel. In 2005 he was bestowed with the Kala Prathiba (Icon of Creative Arts) Award by the Kerala Film Critics Association for his immense contributions to Malayalam cinema. He was also an active member of MACTA (Malayalam Cine Technicians Association). He published his book titled Udyogastha Muthal (meaning ‘From Udyogastha Onwards’) in 2010 reminiscing his life as a filmmaker and his experiences in the film industry."

Born into a family of răzeși (free peasants) in Săcărești, Iași County, he attended primary school in Târgu Frumos. In 1852, he enrolled in Academia Mihăileană; among his teachers were August Treboniu Laurian and Simion Bărnuțiu. He entered the University of Paris in 1865, studying chemistry there. He returned home following graduation, teaching physics and chemistry at Iași's National College and at the military high school. In 1878, he became a professor at the University of Iași, at first teaching at the medicine and science faculties, later only in the mineral chemistry department of the latter. He served as Religious Affairs and Education Minister three times: in 1891, 1895-1896 and in 1918. A bitter rival of his was the Conservative Titu Maiorescu, and he was obliged to leave the Liberal cabinet in 1896 after a dispute related to the Romanian Orthodox Church. When not in government, he continued to work in his chemistry laboratory in Iași. A titular member of the Romanian Academy from 1879, he was also the Academy's president between 1898 and 1901, and again between 1916 and 1920. His wife was the poet Matilda Cugler-Poni."

  "text" : "Patrick Maisonneuve (born 1 March 1955) is a French lawyer of criminal law. He began his legal practice in 1979, and has become famous for taking on widely reviled high-profile clients that other lawyers have shunned. In 2013 and 2014 GQ ranked him the sixth most powerful lawyer of France. He experienced a turning point in his career around 1990, when he joined the defense team in the COGEDIM affair (bogus invoices produced by an important building company) and the one of Henri Emmanuelli (in another affair of bogus invoices). Indeed, as a result, he gradually moved from cases of general criminal law to white collar criminality (without giving up the cases of murder, rape and terrorism entirely). He defended Edmond Hervé in the ministers' trial of the Infected blood scandal in 1999, after years of investigations and procedure; Gilles Ménage (former chief of staff of François Mitterrand) in the trial (2005) of the Presidency's abusive wiretappings (1983–1986); and Sébastien de Montessus, former director of mines of Areva, sued by his own ex-boss, Anne Lauvergeon, for alleged spying of her private life (Sébastien de Montessus has been acquitted). One of his most unpopular clients was Fabrice Burgaud, made famous by the Outreau affair. He defended him in front of the Conseil supérieur de la magistrature (CSM, Higher Judicial Council), and sued two national newspapers as well as Bertrand Tavernier for libel. The newspapers and the movie director have been sentenced. In 2009, Maisonneuve defended the Church of Scientology on charges of profiting illegally. He is defence lawyer for Yoo Som-na, the eldest daughter of Yoo Byung-eun and Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund Regardless, Maisonneuve is on the plaintiffs' side in some important cases, especially the case of the Fédération nationale de la mutualité française against Laboratoires Servier (Mediator scandal). On May 26, 2014, Maisonneuve revealed during a press conference that the company Bygmalion, for which he is the lawyer, made bogus invoices as a result of the pressure exerted by the staff of Nicolas Sarkozy and by the UMP: instead of making bills for Nicolas Sarkozy's campaign, Bygmalion was requested to exaggerate or to invent works for the UMP's ordinary activities, because the electoral expenses exceeded the legal spending limit. Patrick Maisonneuve estimated the total amount of the fake invoices to \"more than 10 million euros\" and called the demand of the UMP for \"financial blackmail\". The next day, the chairman of the UMP, Jean-François Copé announced his resignation. The criminal investigation accelerated during the following months. In the name of his clients, Patrick Maisonneuve also filed three complaints against Le Point, who, in three different articles, had accused Bygmalion of profiting illegally (an accusation never endorsed by the investigative magistrates in charge of the case). After Nicolas Sarkozy was formally indicted in February 2016, Patrick Maisonneuve expressed his satisfaction and reiterated his position: The bogus invoices were all about the excessive expenses of Nicolas Sarkozy's campaign."

In the fall of 1945, Klaehn returned to Saskatoon as regional administrator for the federal Department of Veterans Affairs. In 1946, he became commander of the 17th Infantry Brigade and later the 21st Militia of Saskatoon. Klaehn retired from the militia in 1958 but was named honorary lieutenant-colonel for the North Saskatchewan Regiment. Between the First and Second World Wars, Klaehn also taught school in Saskatoon, North Battleford and Weyburn. He was a high school coach for Ethel Catherwood, who later won a gold medal for Canada in the high jump at the 1928 Summer Olympics. He was elected to Saskatoon city council in a 1958 by-election and served on council until 1963. He was elected mayor following the resignation of Sidney Buckwold in 1963. He was defeated by E. J. Cole when he ran for reelection in 1964. Klaehn was named an officer of the Order of the British Empire. After leaving politics, Klaehn returned to teaching. He served as principal of Biggar Composite School and also taught in Rosetown and Harris. He returned to Saskatoon after he retired from teaching and later died there at the age of 88.

Throughout his sporting career, Cheema trained full-time for NIS Patiala Wrestling Club under his coach and father Sukhchain Singh Cheema. Cheema reached sporting headlines at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, where he grappled his way over Canada's Eric Kirschner to fetch the gold medal in the 120-kg division on technical superiority. Following his immediate sporting success, Cheema went on to pick up a bronze at the Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, and silver at the Asian Championships in his native Delhi by the following year. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Cheema qualified for his first Indian squad, as a 21-year-old, in the men's 120 kg class. Earlier in the process, he placed second at the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria, and guaranteed a spot on the Indian wrestling team by winning his second silver from the Asian Championships in Tehran, Iran. He lost two straight matches each to eventual Olympic champion Artur Taymazov of Uzbekistan on technical superiority, and four-time Olympian Marek Garmulewicz of Poland (4–6), leaving him on the bottom of the prelim pool and placing fifteenth in the final standings. At the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, Cheema campaigned for his bronze medal defense over fancied Kazakh wrestler Marid Mutalimov in the 120-kg division. In 2007, Cheema bid his early retirement from wrestling at the age of 24, capping off his career with a remarkable tally of seven medals (one gold, four silver, and two bronze).Also holds RUSTAM-E-HIND title."

He won two gold medals at the Asian Championships (2001 and 2003), picked up a bronze in the 74-kg division at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, and represented Iran in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Zeidvand trained full-time for Rahahan Wrestling Club under his coach and mentor Gholamreza Ghetassi. Zeidvand made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's welterweight category (69 kg). He lost two straight matches each to Azerbaijan's Islam Dugushiev (5–0) and Finland's Juha Lappalainen (2–1), leaving him on the bottom of the prelim pool and placing sixteenth in the final standings. After his first Olympics, Zeidvand proved particularly successful in his career with two gold medals in both 66 and 69-kg division at the Asian Championships (2001 and 2003). Fighting at five pounds heavier than in his early 2000s, Zeidvand picked up a bronze over Uzbek wrestler and 2000 Olympian Ruslan Biktyakov in the men's 74 kg category at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Zeidvand qualified for his second Iranian squad, as a 24-year-old, in the men's 66 kg class. Earlier in the process, he finished second at the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro to guarantee his spot on the Iranian wrestling team. Redeeming from his previous Olympic setback, Zeidvand dominated the prelim pool with two powerful verdicts over Kyrgyzstan's Kanatbek Begaliev (5–0) and Spain's Moisés Sánchez (3–1) to secure his place for the next round. Zeidvand kept his Iranian squad wrecking with a grueling 2–1 defeat to Azerbaijan's Farid Mansurov in the quarterfinal match. For refusing to appear in the fifth-place match, Zeidvand, along with reigning Olympic silver medalist Kim In-Sub of South Korea, were disqualified from the tournament and thereby received a lifetime ban from the sport by the International Federation of Associated Wrestling (FILA)."

  "text" : "Paddy Cardiff (8 November 1925 – 3 June 2005) was an Irish trade unionist. Born in Dublin, into a family heavily involved in trade unionism, Cardiff left school at 13 and joined the British Army near the end of World War II. He returned to Dublin in 1948, where he soon started work at Guinness, and became active in the Workers' Union of Ireland (WUI). He was one of a group of trade unionists who secured recognition of the union by the company, and he rapidly rose through the union, working for it full-time from 1964. In 1969, he was elected as Deputy General Secretary of the WUI, in which role he led the union's campaign for Ireland to join the European Economic Community. Cardiff was elected as General Secretary of the WUI in 1977, and led negotiations which several years after his 1982 retirement brought about a long-anticipated merger with the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. He served as President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in 1983, then retired on account of ill health."

  "text" : "Pierre Daboval (3 July 1918 - May 2015) was a French artist. Daboval studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, the Académie Julian and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, 'plucking here and there from the teachings, until I had enough to make a bouquet'. From 1949 to 1951 he lived and worked in Sweden, and then, on his return to France he lived successively in Auvers-sur-Oise and Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. The Musée Estrine in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence holds an important collection of his work. He has exhibited in Switzerland, Belgium and France. In 1974 his works were shown at the Galérie Romanet, Paris, as part of an exhibition of erotic drawings ('Un peu d'erotisme'), alongside Hans Bellmer, Bernard Buffet, André Masson, Josep Puigmarti and Picasso. In 1970 Daboval gave up painting to devote himself to drawing: 'I felt definitively that drawing, which I had always loved, was truly my vehicle: firstly the incisiveness of the pen, then the pencil, with its sensual inflections- these were to become my means of expression for these delicate things.... I feel there are infinite possibilities to exploit, despite the obvious restrictions of black and white. There are further subtleties to discover when entering this universe in which I feel at home and which I discover, little by little, to be under-exploited, perhaps because it still instils fear.' Between 1975 and 1990 Pierre Daboval explored what he called the 'fantastico-érotique'. 'He is able to synthesise the male and the female like no other artist I know of (except Picasso, Masson and Bellmer) but with a totally different personality.'  From 1990 he mainly produced portraits, especially self-portraits. From 1998 to his death in May 2015 he lived and worked in Mirepoix, Ariège."

She was trained by her father along with her older three brothers Francis, John, and Charles, and two sisters Sarah and Magdalen, who took up their father's profession and became draughtsmen and miniature painters as well. They continued his workshop after their father died in 1658 and all died in London. Attributions of works have sometimes been difficult because of the similarities in style between Francis and his children. Penelope has been ascribed two miniatures of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter (1677), and Dorothea, daughter of Richard Cromwell (1668), signed P.C."

  "text" : "Petia Yanchulova (Bulgarian: Петя Янчулова; born July 3, 1978 in Sofia) is a Bulgarian beach volleyball player. She represented her nation Bulgaria in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), along with her partner and elder sister Tzvetelina. Despite being born in Bulgaria, Yanchulova trained most of her sporting career in San Diego, California, United States, playing for the University of San Diego's volleyball team. Yanchulova began her sporting career at the University of San Diego in San Diego, California, where she competed for the San Diego Toreros volleyball team. While playing for the Toreros, she led her team to two impressive victories at the West Coast Conference Championships, and was also named the Defender of the Year in 1999 because of her tremendous impact to the university's volleyball program. Petia was named to the First Team All-American team (together with Misty May and Kerri Walsh) for two years in a row in 1998 and 1999. Petia was also honored in the San Diego Hall of Champions and was induced in the West Coast Conference Hall of Fame for her outstanding accomplishments at the University of San Diego. Since 1998, Yanchulova competed professionally at the FIVB World Tour along with her sister Tzvetelina. The Bulgarian tandem also made their official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where they both placed seventeenth in the women's beach volleyball, defeating European bronze medalists Deborah and Rebekka_Kadijk along the way. Four years later, at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the Yanchulova sisters qualified for their second Olympics in the same tournament by obtaining their berth from the FIVB Grand Slam Series in Klagenfurt, Austria. This time, defeating the reigning European Champions of Germany in pool play, the sisters advanced to the Round of 16, eventually losing in a dramatic battle against eventual Olympic silver medalists of Brazil, Adriana_Behar and Shelda_Bede and placing 9th overall. When her elder sister retired from the sport in 2007, Yanchulova went on to play indoor volleyball professionally in Europe from 2008–2009."

In 1844 he, his wife Margaret, and their three sons and four daughters came to the Greenfield, Wisconsin area from Prussia, buying eighty acres of land at the interception of what are now Cold Spring Road, South 76th Street, and Forest Home Avenue. In addition to farming, he ran a tavern, was postmaster, and even lent money since there were no banks nearby (he charged interest rates from seven to ten percent). By 1864, when his son Hubert Lavies became postmaster of Root Creek, Peter was a widower, and retired. He would die at the age of 86 as the result of a fall from a wagon."

He was born at Chawton House, Alton, Hampshire and died there as well. Knight was the son of Edward Knight, who was himself the eldest son of Edward Austen Knight, the brother of the novelist Jane Austen who changed his own family name to \"Knight\" in 1812 in order to inherit substantial landholdings in Kent and Hampshire. Edward Knight and three of his brothers (George Thomas, Henry and Brook) played first-class cricket; one of Philip Knight's brothers and several brothers-in-law also played. Philip Knight was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, though there is no record that he completed a degree there. After Cambridge, he joined the Royal Welch Fusiliers, rising to the rank of major and seeing service in the Indian Mutiny and in the siege and capture of Lucknow. In 1865, he was adjutant of the East Kent Militia."

He also discovered the laws of modern software engineering and architecture in the early 1990s (before others rediscovered them in the late 1990s): Miller's laws are: 1. The number of interactions within a development team is O(n!) without controlled access to the baseline. If the development team does have controlled access to the baseline, interactions can be reduced to near O(n), where n is the number of developers and/or files in the source tree, whichever is larger. 2. The baseline MUST always be in working order. 3. The software build/construction process can be reduced to a directed, acyclical graph (DAG). 4. It is necessary to build a rigid framework of selected components (aka the top level aegis design). 5. The framework should not do any real work, and should instead delegate everything to external components. The external components should be as interchangeable as possible. 6. The framework should use the Strategy pattern for most complex tasks."

  "text" : "Peter Charles Marquardt (July 1, 1964 – July 19, 2014) was an American actor and video game producer. He was best known for his debut film role as the drug lord Moco in Robert Rodriguez's 1992 action film El Mariachi. He landed the role following a chance encounter with Rodriguez at a research facility, where both men were volunteering as test subjects for cholesterol-lowering medication. Rodriguez cast Marquardt in the Spanish-language El Mariachi despite the fact that Marquardt did not speak Spanish. Marquardt reprised the role of Moco for a flashback sequence in Rodriguez's next film, Desperado. He later appeared in Rodriguez's Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over and starred in the 2011 horror-thriller The Shadow People. Outside of film acting, Marquardt was an associate producer on several video games for Ion Storm, including Deus Ex and Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom. He also co-produced Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3. Marquardt died in Austin, Texas on July 19, 2014. He was 50."

Diamand was born in Berlin on 8 June 1913, and educated there, but held Austrian nationality. In the early 1930s, being Jewish, he fled to Amsterdam to escape Nazism. While there, he worked as secretary to pianist Artur Schnabel. Diamand spent some time in a Dutch concentration camp before escaping. He and his mother needed to hide from the Nazis, in attics and other cramped places, with inadequate food. Schnabel's last student, pianist Maria Curcio, looked after them, at great risk and high cost to her own health and career. In 1947, they married. They divorced in 1971. He subsequently married American violinist, Sylvia Rosenberg. He appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 15 August 1966, and was made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1972. Diamand died on 16 January 1998, in Amsterdam."

  "text" : "Pat Garrod (b. Chelmsford 1964) is a British physician and long distance motorcyclist. He and his wife Vanessa Lewis undertook a 100,000-mile (160,000 km) round-the-world ride on a 1991 BMW R100GS, between 1998 and October, 2002. His 2010 book Bearback — The World Overland describing the 4-year journey was called as a \"damned good story\" by Overland magazine, and evidence of improving quality in self-published overland adventure books. After the circumnavigation, Garrod and Lewis crossed Africa twice more by motorcycle. One north-to-south traversal in 2006 was more than 20,000 kilometres (12,000 mi) long; Garrod's travel log records a total of over 65,000 miles (105,000 km) in Africa alone."

  "text" : "Professor Pamela Athalie Deidre Rickard (1928 – 2002) was an Australian biochemist, serving as head of the University of New South Wales School of Biological Sciences from 1981 to 1988. Born in Sydney, she worked for a few years at the Daily Telegraph newspaper, before completing a TAFE course and entering Sydney University as a mature age student. She then gained a Masters in biochemistry at the New South Wales University of Technology, writing her thesis on the \"iron-containing pigments of certain fungi\" under Professor Bernhard Ralph and Dr Frank Moss, and graduating in 1961. She then began a PhD in London on the biosynthesis of porphyrins under Professor Claude Rimington, finishing in 1963. She then began a permanent lecturing position at the University of New South Wales, where she would remain until retirement in 1988. In the mid 1960s, she became part of the cutting edge field of biotechnology when the school was restructured as the Department of Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering, only the third biotechnology department in the world at the time. She worked initially on yeast biochemistry, followed by enzyme technology, making interesting discoveries relating to the Crabtree effect, where cytochromes are not synthesised in high-glucose yeast environments. Her group also found that synthesis of other yeast fermentation enzymes was enhanced in such environments, discoveries useful to the brewing industry. In the 1970s, she worked on the use of enzymes in wine production, with the goal of using sultana grapes for wine, before moving on to the digestion of ligno-cellulosic waste. In 1974 she published a review of the use of enzyme technology in industry. She retired in 1988, receiving an emeritus professorship, compiling and editing a History of the Development of Biotechnology at UNSW in the same year."

He was then appointed a lecturer at Durham University in 1953. He graduated with a BMus from Durham in that year and took the MA with a dissertation on 17th-century chamber music manuscripts in Durham Cathedral Library. He was awarded the DMus by the university in 1958. From 1961 to 1990 he was professor of music at the University of Southampton. After his early studies of viol music, in particular that of John Jenkins, Evans has worked mainly on the 20th century, writing articles on Jonathan Harvey, Alan Rawsthorne (for the 1980 edition of The New Grove) and especially on the music of Benjamin Britten. According to Grove, he has brought to that subject \"an acute analytical mind coupled with an approach in which musical values are firmly assigned first place\". He is now Emeritus Professor of Music at Southampton University."

Chippindale reported on the Birmingham Six trial and that of the Guildford Four and \"he thought they'd got the wrong men in both cases\". His suspicions convinced Chris Mullin to investigate and led eventually to their acquittal. In 1981 he worked on documentaries for London Weekend Television's The London Programme. He was news editor for the left wing News on Sunday and charted its demise with fellow ex-employee Chris Horrie in their book Disaster: The Rise and Fall of News on Sunday.

His style puts him in the Córdoba School, although he also shows influence of both Flemish and Italian art. He was elected president of the Guild of Saint Luke in 1515. Documents show that he got into financial difficulties, because in 1528 he was arrested for debt. He is known to have painted the Adoration of the Magi for the altarpiece in the church of Espejo in Córdoba, and Virgin and Child in the Museo de Bellas Artes (Córdoba), dated 1488."

  "text" : "Philip Oliphant Kington (17 December 1832 – 2 July 1892) was an English businessman and landowner who inherited a Scottish clan chiefdom and also played a single first-class cricket game in Australia. From 1867, when he inherited Ardblair Castle in Scotland from his maternal Oliphant relatives, he took the triple-barrelled name \"Kington-Blair-Oliphant\". He was born at Clifton, Bristol and died at Datchet, then in Berkshire, now in Buckinghamshire. Kington was the son of Thomas Kington of Charlton House, Wraxall in north Somerset; he was educated at Harrow School and in 1851 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, although there is no record that he completed a degree at Cambridge University. He played cricket at Harrow, and appeared in the Eton v Harrow match in 1851, but there is no evidence that he played at all at Cambridge. In January 1855, he was named as one of the founding \"resident members\" of the new Melbourne, Australia branch of Miles and Kington, the family firm and a Bristol-based company of \"General Agents and Commission Merchants\", alongside William Augustus Mackworth, who had earlier played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and Manchester Cricket Club. Both Mackworth and Kington were elected members of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce in May 1855. Kington was also elected to the committee of the Melbourne Cricket Club in October 1855. The big match of the 1855/56 cricket season in Melbourne was a projected first game against a team from Sydney; this was later expanded to a match between the two colonies of Victoria and New South Wales and Kington was one of five Melbourne Cricket Club players selected for the Victoria team. The match, later regarded as first-class, was very low scoring; Kington was one of only three Victoria players to reach double figures in the game, scoring 12 not out in the first innings, but being out for 0 in the second – he also kept wicket in the second New South Wales innings. Kington remained with the Melbourne Cricket Club the following year but then appears to have returned to England; he is recorded in a minor match in the 1858 season and then in others across the 1860s, but he did not play first-class cricket again. He inherited Ardblair Castle in 1867 and with it responsibilities within a branch of Clan Oliphant; by the time of his death in 1892, however, he was living at Datchet Lodge, Datchet. He left £21,000 in his will and was buried at Wraxall."

An alumnus of Amherst College and Columbia University, he served in the US Air Force prior to becoming an early member of the Gay Activists Alliance, a protest group that split off from the Gay Liberation Front after the Stonewall riots with the goal of \"writing the revolution into law.\" Fisher led a number of the \"zaps\", or protests targeted at public figures, organized by the GAA, as well as serving as an unofficial historian for the group. Fisher received the Stonewall Book Award in 1972 for The Gay Mystique: The Myth and Reality of Male Homosexuality, later described as \"one of the first books to look at the subject from the inside rather than from a heterosexual’s viewpoint.\" His manuscripts and papers are archived at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center in New York, together with those of his partner and fellow activist Marc Rubin."

  "text" : "Brigadier-General Philip Howell CMG (7 December 1877 - 7 October 1916) was a senior British Army staff officer during World War I. He was, successively, Brigadier-General, General Staff (BGGS) to the Cavalry Corps under General Allenby (1915), and then BGGS to X Corps under Lt. General Morland (1915). In October1915 he was posted as Chief of Staff (BGGS) to the British Salonika Army under Lt. General Mahon, before appointment as Chief of Staff (BGGS) and second-in-command to II Corps under Lt. General Jacob, forming part of General Gough's \"Reserve Army\" (Fifth Army) at the Battle of Somme in 1916. Howell was killed in action at Authuille by shrapnel on 7 October 1916, after making a personal reconnaissance of the front line near Thiepval during the later Somme offensives. Howell had been in action on the front line since the start of WWI, serving with the BEF, and commanding the 4th Queen's Own Hussars as Lt. Colonel through The Retreat from Mons, The Battle of Le Cateau, The Marne offensive, Hill 60, and the First Battle of Ypres. He was mentioned in dispatches six times, and made a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George(CMG) in 1915, for \"meritorious service\". Philip Howell came from a military family, his father Lt. Colonel Horace Howell had served as commander of a Punjab Frontier Force regiment in India, Afghanistan, and Kashmir. After education in England (Lancing College) and passing out from Royal Military College, Sandhurst with honours, he joined the elite Queen's Own Corps of Guides (\"Lumsden's Horse\") as a subaltern in 1900. His abilities were recognised by Major General Douglas Haig, when Inspector-General of Cavalry, India. Haig made him his Brigade-Major at the young age of 25 for cavalry manoeuvres in India in 1903. This was the start of a lifelong friendship between Haig and Howell. Howell's interests were more extensive than soldiering, and he travelled extensively throughout the Balkan region, becoming a correspondent for The Times newspaper and an expert on the local politics of the Near East. This experience and a formidable intellect led to his becoming a senior instructor (professor) at the Staff College, Camberley. He had himself attended the Staff College at Quetta, in India in 1903/4. It was expected, even amongst the highest military circles, that had Howell not been killed in action in October 1916 whilst visiting front line trenches, he would have reached the highest command in the British Army. This was certainly the view of many of his contemporaries and peers. At the age of 37, he was fully gazetted as Brigadier-General in September 1915, and rather than holding \"temporary\" rank was the youngest fully promoted General in the British Army during WWI. Of military significance, was his direct role in the strategic planning of the later conclusive actions of the Somme offensive; the successful battles of Thiepval Ridge and Ancre Heights. These used more sophisticated planned attacks using techniques such as synchronised barrages, the use of a limited number of tanks and proper briefing of field commanders. Lt. General Sir Claud Jacob, is quoted as saying that much of what his Corps (II Corps) achieved during the Somme was owed to Howell's efforts, and in fact he had left much of the daily command to Howell, who was a man of exceptional capability."

  "text" : "Philip Harry Cummings (1906-1991) was a world traveler, teacher of Modern Languages, and paid lecturer and news analyst. He was born and grew up in Hardwick, Vermont. He received a B.A. in Modern Languages from Rollins College in 1929, and an M.A. in Spanish from Middlebury College, 1932. He began but did not complete a Ph.D. at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. One article from his research there was published in the professional journal Hispania. Cummings was a great traveler and made sixteen transatlantic crossings between ages 19 and 29. He is remembered as a remarkable (positive) character, the sort of man you never forget. Cummings sometimes wrote to important people, including the eminent Spanish scholar Miguel de Unamuno, \"cold\" and was able to meet them. He was introduced to Alfonso XIII, King of Spain at court and got to know the Spanish Royal Family and the Duke of Alba. One of the most important episodes in Cummings's life was the ten days he spent with his friend and lover, Spanish poet and playwright Federico García Lorca, in August 1929. The two met in Madrid in 1928 and spent another brief time together when Lorca was en route to New York in June 1929. At the conclusion of the Columbia University summer session of 1929, Lorca went by train to Burlington, Vermont, and from there to the Cummings family's summer rental cottage in Eden Mills, Vermont. During that visit, Cummings translated Lorca's book Canciones (Songs) into English, with Lorca's advice on key points. This is the only translation of Lorca's work into any language in which he is known to have participated. During this period, Lorca also wrote several poems that became part of his book Poeta en Nueva York. Cummings and Lorca renewed their friendship in the fall of 1930 when Cummings returned to Madrid on a IIE fellowship. He returned to the United States abruptly the following spring on the advice of his IIE sponsors, just before Alfonso XIII left the throne. There is no evidence that Cummings ever saw Lorca again, although they may have continued to exchange letters. Cummings claimed to have destroyed an autobiographical manuscript that Lorca left with him in 1929, but there is no independent evidence that the manuscript ever existed, and Cummings is far from a reliable source. In the midst of the Great Depression, Cummings was happy to get a job teaching Spanish, French, and German at the Valley Ranch School for Boys in Cody, Wyoming. He kept a detailed diary of his first year there. One portion, dealing with a school holiday visit to the South Dakota capital, Pierre, has been published, and the rest is being prepared for publication. The school closed in 1934. Starting in 1938, Cummings began a new career as a paid lecturer and news analyst. He was represented by various agencies; in the 1950s he was represented by the W. Colston Leigh agency of New York, Washington, and San Francisco, where he joined a roster of speakers that included such famous names as David Brinkley, Vance Packard, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Cummings's appeal as a lecturer was reflected in his billing as the agency's top repeat speaker on world affairs. He made his home for many years in Woodstock, Vermont."

  "text" : "Prosper Joannes Gerardus Antonius Ego (17 July 1927 – 23 January 2015) was the founder of the Oud-Strijders Legioen (“Former Warriors Legion”). Ego was born into a Roman Catholic family at The Hague. At the age of 17, during the Nazi German occupation of the Netherlands, he was arrested and deported to Germany as a forced labourer. On his return he worked in the administration of the Red Cross. Ego was sent as a conscript to the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) in 1947 where he was stationed in the Dutch army garrison at Makassar, Sulawesi as a hygienist. On Ego’s return to the Netherlands in 1950 he worked for some time at the Red Cross, and afterwards as an insurance agent. He was active in the Katholiek Nationale Partij (Catholic National Party) and participated in the founding of the Veteranen Legioen Nederland (Veteran’s League of the Netherlands). At the end of 1955, partly under pressure from the Catholic Church, the Katholiek Nationale Partij was absorbed by the Katholieke Volkspartij (Catholic People’s Party). Some KNP members, particularly in the Hague, opposed this, and in early 1956 the Nationale Unie (National Unity) party was formed. Ego stood as a candidate for the NU in the parliamentary elections of that year, but failed to get elected. After the Hungarian uprising in 1956 conflicts arose within the Veteranen Legioen Nederland. Partly because of these conflicts, Ego set up the Oud-Strijders Legioen for those who served in the Korean War in 1958, and became its chairman. He was the Nationale Unie’s candidate for the Hague in municipal elections in 1958, but was not elected. In 1960 some members of the Nationale Unie left and joined the newly formed Liberale Staatspartij (Liberal Party). Ego became vice-chairman, and stood as a candidate in the parliamentary elections of 1963, but the party failed to win a single seat. Ego supported apartheid in South Africa, and was one of the founders of the Stichting Nederlands Zuid-Afrikaanse Werkgemeenschap (Netherlands-South Africa Friendship Association). He was also involved with the Stichting Nederland-Verenigde Staten van Amerika (Netherlands-USA Association). During the 1970s the OSL was opened to non-veterans. Ego used the OSL’s magazine Sta Vast to publish pro-Nato and pro-American articles. The OSL flew airplanes over peace demonstrations with banners carrying the slogans “Rather a rocket in the garden than a Russian in the kitchen” and “Stop the SS20 rocket”. In 1995 Ego was fined 5000 guilders (2270 euros) after being found guilty of inciting xenophobia. The charges related to articles published in Sta Vast in 1992, in which ethnic minorities were called \"profiteers\" and \"criminals\". Although the articles were not written by Ego, as editor he was held responsible for their publication. In an interview in 2004 Ego stated that since the conviction articles were carefully scrutinised before being sent to the printer. In the September 2009 issue of Sta Vast Ego announced his intention to quit as president and chief. It was also announced that the Sta-Vast van de Stichtingen voor Vrijheid en Veiligheid would be wound up. The two main reasons were Ego's age (82) and the decline in readership, which had fallen from a high of 14,000 in the 1980s to 2,500. In 2010 the Oud-Strijders Legioen closed. Some OSL board members started a website, OSL-Actueel (OSL-News). Ego wrote for this website. He died in Breda in 2015."

In 1324, Peter is attested as lord of half of the Barony of Arcadia in the Principality of Achaea, and it is usually assumed that this came about as a result of a second marriage to Balzana Gozzadini, the widow of Baron Erard II of Aulnay.

  "text" : "Peder Pedersen Aadnes (10 August 1739 – 20 June 1792) was a Norwegian rural painter. Aadnes was born in Odnes in Fluberg. Unusually for a rural painter, he chose typical upper-class subjects for his repertoire. He decorated churches, farm interiors, and furnishings throughout eastern Norway in the Rococo style. Aadnes also painted portraits. Aadnes's painting are often referred to as a transitional form in Norwegian painting, from more traditional folk art and the new Norwegian painting represented by Johan Christian Dahl. Aadnes was a pioneering artist in the tradition of Dutch and German painters. His style paved the way for the later traditional floral decorations and floral paintings known as rosemaling in villages in Norway, and also formed a backdrop for Norwegian Romantic nationalism. Because of Aadnes's role between traditional Dutch and German Rococo, and between the new Norwegian painting on the one hand and traditional floral paintings on the other, he is sometimes referred to as the greatest Norwegian artist of the 1700s."

After having been part of several other orchestras and jazz bands, in the early 1930s Redaelli started his solo career as a singer-entertainer, specializing in creating humorous covers in the Milanese dialect of popular American songs. In 1939, he adopted his stage name and formed the \"Quintetto del Delirio\" (Delirium Quintet), with whom he got several successes with cover songs where the English lyrics were replaced by an onomatopoeic, gibberish language. Since the 1960s Starnazza also appeared in numerous films, in supporting and character roles. He died of cardiac arrest at 66 years old."

  "text" : "Paolo Budinich (28 August 1916 – 14 November 2013) was a theoretical physicist. Born from a sailors' descent from Lussingrande, grew up and studied in Trieste, where the family resided, because the father Antonio Budini taught in the local High School, the same where Paolo Budinich got his grade in 1934. He later started his study course at Università degli Studi di Pisa graduating at the Scuola Normale Superiore in 1938. In the same year he started to teach physics on the Italian training ship Amerigo Vespucci, belonging to Italian Naval Academy of Leghorn. During Second World War he served as Leutnant on the Navy submarines and observator on the Navy planes; in 1941 Budinich was caught prisoner by the Royal Navy and became a prisoner of war, thus being transferred to England and in the United States. Back to Physics, in 1952 he worked with Werner Heisenberg in Göttingen and in 1954 with Wolfgang Pauli in Zürich. He was one of the first promoters of Trieste as a science resort at international level. In 1964 he founded in Trieste, together with Abdus Salam, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP). In the same year he promoted the Advanced School of Physics, that in 1978 was upgraded to the School for Higher Studies SISSA, which was the first Italian higher education institution providing PhD (besides Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa) and became its first director. In his autobiography L'arcipelago delle meraviglie, published in 2000, Budinich pleads for a reunification between science and philosophy and suggests a superior capability of mathematics to disclose unknown scientific discovery paths. His main work, The Spinorial Chessboard, written together with the polish mathematical physicist Andrzej Trautman, refers to Elie Cartan's conceptual foundation of spinor geometry and explores its applications to modern physics."

  "text" : "Panchashikha, who appears in Shanti Parva (Book of Liberation) of Mahabharata (Chapter 218), was a long-lived disciple of Asuri who was a teacher of Samkhya Philosophy. As a follower of Kapila, Panchshikha was one of the earliest teachers of philosophy belonging to the Samkhya School of thought. He wrote a great number of works including 60000 verses concerning the nature of matter (Prakṛti), the nature of the self, the faculties of perception and action and supra normal powers. Shashti Tantra is believed to be his work. Uluka, nicknamed Kanada, the author of  Vaisheshika Sutra  and who taught Krishna, was a disciple of Panchashikha. Dharmadhvaja Janaka, the king of Mithila, one of Panchshikha’s disciples, had asked Panchashikha about the relation between the body and the soul in the earthly life and after death. At several places, Vyasa, in his commentary on the Patañjali Yoga Sutras II.5, II.16, II.17 etc., by way of clarification, has specifically cited the opinions expressed by Panchashikha in respect of the nature of the body and the soul. Kapha is believed to have fostered Panchshikha on her milk and thus emerged the Samkhya Philosophy. In the Vedic Tarpana Viddhi, the method of offering water, Panchashikha is revered in the process of Manushya tarpana, offering water to Original Men, in the mantra which reads: औं संकश्च सनन्दश्च तृतीयश्च सनातनःकपिलश्चासुरिश्चैव वोढुः पञ्चशिखस्तथासर्वे ते तृप्तिमायान्तु मद्दत्तेनाम्बुना सदा ||\"Let Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, Kapila, Asuri Bardhu and Panchshikha be all satisfied with the water offered by me.\""

Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory. After the war she was executive assistant to directors of Scripps Institute of Oceanography and the National Accelerator Laboratory. A graduate of the University of California, from which she obtained a degree in political science, Priscilla Greene started working for Lawrence in February 1942, and then for Oppenheimer later that year. She arrived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on March 1943, and established the Los Alamos Laboratory's office. She became the office manager at Los Alamos, greeting visitors, answering the telephone, making travel arrangements, arranging security passes and accommodation, and taking notes of telephone calls. In September 1943, she married Robert Duffield, a chemist working at the Los Alamos laboratory, and changed her surname from Greene to Duffield. In the post-war years, Duffield was secretary and executive assistant to Roger Revelle, the director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In November 1967, she became secretary and executive assistant to Robert R. Wilson, the founding director of the National Accelerator Laboratory, and once again she helped establish a new scientific laboratory on a new site. In later life she moved to Colorado, where she served on the board of the Uncompahgre Medical Clinic."

He heard Mahatma Gandhi speaking of a \"Free India\" in 1935 and later was a close aide of his. He followed Thakkar Bapa from Uska, in Basti district, to be with Gandhi, who was perplexed to see such a young boy wanting to fight for freedom and took him in at Segaon, Wardha and personally tutored him. Vidyarthi was arrested in 1942 at Sevagram, Wardha by the British at the outset of the Quit India Movement. He was immediately put in an isolation cell and tortured. A postcard was issued to honour his arrest. He wrote his first book on Gandhi during his jail term. After India's independence from British rule, Prabhudayal returned to his village and started working with local villagers at the behest of Gandhi. He convinced local zamindars (landlords) to help farmers get their land back. Many attempts to kill him were made as this did not go well with zamindars. In 1951-52, Jawaharlal Nehru asked him to contest in the first Indian General Elections. He was the youngest member of Sevagram Wardha. He was also the youngest person elected to the Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh in the first Indian general election. He is widely known as \"Purvanchal ke Gandhi\" as he was the only person from Purvanchal (Eastern UP), to have lived with Gandhi. He returned to Purvanchal only after India had attained freedom. He died, aged 52, on 7 September 1977, due to heart failure at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh."

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Pan.) Pan Fusheng (Chinese: 潘复生; December 1908 – April 1980) was a Chinese Communist revolutionary and politician. He was the first party secretary of the short-lived Pingyuan Province of the People's Republic of China, and also served as the First Secretary (i.e. party chief) of Henan and Heilongjiang provinces. During the Great Leap Forward, Pan sympathized with Marshal Peng Dehuai, a critic of Mao Zedong's collectivization policy. As a result, in 1958 he was dismissed as party chief of Henan and subjected to persecution, but was later rehabilitated. When the Cultural Revolution began, Pan, then party chief of Heilongjiang province, embraced the rebel Red Guards movement and gained the support of Mao. However, he was soon involved in major factional violence, and was dismissed again in 1971 and put under investigation. In 1982, the Communist Party of China posthumously criticized him for committing \"serious mistakes\" during the Cultural Revolution."
