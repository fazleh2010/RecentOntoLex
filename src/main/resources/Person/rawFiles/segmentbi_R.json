  "text" : "Robert Lansdorp (born 1938, Semarang, Indonesia) is a professional tennis coach. He first rose to international fame in 1979 when his student Tracy Austin became the youngest US Open Women's Singles champion in history at age 16. He has gone on to coach other tennis champions including Pete Sampras, Lindsay Davenport, and Maria Sharapova. He is regarded as an expert on groundstrokes, in particular the forehand, advocating a powerful, flat hitting technique commonly referred to as the \"Lansdorp Forehand\". In 2004, Lansdorp said: \"I’ve never received anything from one player. Not even a $500 gift. They’re all multi-millionaires but I’ve never received one thing. And I’m telling you, if Maria doesn’t put a Mercedes convertible in my driveway, I’m going to shoot myself.\" Lansdorp received the USTA Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005 and was honored as a Team USA Coaching Legend along with Nick Bollettieri, Jerry Baskin and Jack Sharpe at the inaugural 2013 Team USA Coaching Legend reception in Indian Wells, California. In 2013 he publicly criticized the United States Tennis Association's Player Development program under General Manager Patrick McEnroe, saying the 2012 mandate requiring players under the age of ten compete on miniature courts with lightweight green-dot balls is \"wrong for the very talented kids.\" Sharapova, Monica Seles and the Williams sisters, he noted, were very competitive with standard courts and equipment from age 7."

  "text" : "Richard Meros is the pseudonym for a writer from Wellington, New Zealand. He is best known for the book On the conditions and possibilities of Helen Clark taking me as her Young Lover and the theatrical adaptations of his work. First published in 2005, On the conditions and possibilities of Helen Clark taking me as her Young Lover, received favourable reviews in New Zealand and international press. The book, often shortened to OTC&POHCTMAHYL, asked why Helen Clark, the Prime Minister at the time would want a young lover and then why the young lover would be Meros. The book is a work of metafiction as it concludes that the greatest likelihood of Meros being taken as a young lover would be if he wrote a book on the conditions and possibilities of being taken as a young lover. The Guardian described it as ‘decidedly lascivious’ and the NZ Listener called it a ‘mock philosophical treatise’ before praising it as ‘the underground publishing hit of the decade’. The book was reissued and adapted into a play of the same name in 2007, touring nationally and was nominated for theatrical performance of the year. For his role as Meros, Arthur Meek was awarded the most promising male newcomer of 2008 at the Chapman Tripp Awards. In 2015, the book was once again adapted into a play that substitutes Hillary Clinton for Helen Clark. In 2007 Meros released Richard Meros salutes the Southern Man, a pastoral account of the cultural persona of a male from the south of New Zealand’s South Island. This was adapted by the same team that made On the conditions and possibilities of Helen Clark taking me as her Young Lover and toured to positive reviews winning best touring production at the Dunedin Theatre Awards. The book was reissued for the theatrical tour with an introduction by Duncan Sarkies. In 2008, Meros released Beggars and Choosers: The Complete Written Correspondence Between Creative New Zealand and Richard Meros volume one which was followed with a second volume titled $30 Meat Pack in 2012. When Privatising Parts was released in 2011, it was viewed by New Zealand media as a follow up to On the conditions and possibilities of Helen Clark taking me as her Young Lover. This book argued that if the new Prime Minister John Key did not want to lose office he would have to learn the lesson that Helen Clark did not. Meros argues that it was not his reasoning that was ineffective in the first book, but that love, itself was inefficient. He proposed that the government first nationalise love through a State Owned Enterprise and secondly privatise it. This book toured New Zealand and Australia in 2012 and 2013, through a new collaboration with Heleyni Pratley (actor/screenwriter) and Eleanor Bishop (director). Meros has released four other books since 2011 through Lawrence & Gibson in New Zealand, including novels and a textbook, though none have achieved the success of On the conditions and possibilities of Helen Clark taking me as her Young Lover. He has also written for a wide range of publications in New Zealand from current affairs magazine NZ Listener and daily newspaper the Dominion Post to arts publications White Fungus and Letting Space, literary magazine Hue & Cry, and for the group Political Organisation Aotearoa. In 2015, Meros was a recipient of Eleanor Catton's Horoeka Grant. In response he wrote the essay 'New Bourgeoizealand' on a politics of lack and abundance in New Zealand."

  "text" : "Rosalia Price, née Masson (fl. 1790), also known as Rosalia Masson-Price or only as Madame Price, was a British circus artist (acrobat and pantomime artist). She was active in Sweden in 1787-1790. Together with her spouse, the acrobat Peter Price (1761-1790), she founded the first circus in Stockholm, Sweden and Scandinavia, and as such has an important place in the history of the circus in Sweden and Scandinavia. Alongside Antonio Bartolomeo Spinacuta, Price are counted as one of two of all of the foreign artists during the Gustavian age who made a lasting effect on the cultural development in Sweden. She should not be confused with her sister-in-law Hanne Tott, also called Madame Price. Rosalia Masson was married to her colleague Peter Price from London, with whom she had three children. Together with her brother-in-law James Price (1761-1805), they founded a circus company, where they mainly performed with acrobats and pantomime artists by horse. After having applied for a permission to perform in Denmark without success, they were granted such a permission for Sweden, and in October 1787, they founded a circus in Stockholm. Though an individual horse acrobat, Jacob Bates, her performed in Stockholm in 1770, this was the first circus company in Sweden, and thereby the introduction of the circus in Scandinavia: her brother-in-law James and his spouse Hanne Tott was to introduce the circus in Denmark and Norway in the 1790s. The Price circus were successful in Stockholm, were Rosalia were apparently the main attraction as she were frequently mentioned first when the circus was mentioned; she focused on acrobatics on horse while Peter Price acted in pantomime and displayed his strength. They also toured the Swedish countryside. At an incident at Comediehuset in Gothenburg, Rosalia Price threatened the audience with a whip and a gun when they expressed displeasure, which turned a fiasco to a success. The Price Circus left Sweden in 1790: Peter Price apparently died the same year, as Rosalia Price remarried the horse acrobat Christoph de Bach the same year and followed him to Vienna."

  "text" : "Rolf Hauge (14 August 1923 – 28 October 2002) was a Norwegian trade unionist and politician. He was born in Halden and started working at the local paper factory, Saugbrugsforeningen, following in the footsteps of his father. He would rather work in the factory's workshop, and was hired here in 1947. He joined the union Håndverksarbeidernes Forening. He was promoted to chairman here in 1957, and was also elected to Berg municipal council. In 1951 he was elected to the control committee of the Norwegian Union of Paper Industry Workers, as he attended his first national convention. He served as secretary from 1963, deputy chairman from 1967 and chairman from 1975 to 1988. The Norwegian Union of Paper Industry Workers then merged with others to form the United Federation of Trade Unions; Hauge was instrumental in this merger. He died in October 2002 and was buried in Os in Halden."

He taught English and history at Omagh Academy for eleven years. Glenndinning was a founder of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, and left teaching in 1973 to become its full-time political organiser. He stood for the party in Mid Ulster at the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election and Armagh at the February 1974 general election, but missed election on both occasions. In 1976, Glendinning returned to teaching, working at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, although he remained politically active, campaigning for the Alliance Party into the 1980s, and presenting a submission to the New Ireland Forum in 1983. He also began writing short stories, some of which were published in the Irish Times, as a result of which he won the Hennessey Award. Following this, he switched to write plays, several of which were produced for BBC Television and Radio. These early works included The Artist, Condemning Violence, Culture Vultures, Faith, Mumbo Jumbo and Stuffing It. In 1991, his Donny Boy won \"Best New Play\" at the inaugural TMA Awards, and this success inspired him to again quit teaching, this time to become a full-time writer."

  "text" : "Robert Shirley FRS (4 September 1673 – 25 February 1699 N.S.), styled Hon. Robert Shirley after 1677, was a British politician and aesthete. An unsuccessful Parliamentary candidate for Staffordshire in 1698, he was admitted to the Royal Society the next year and died shortly thereafter. Shirley was born at Staunton Harold Hall, the eldest son of Sir Robert Shirley, 7th Baronet, later Baron Ferrers of Chartley. Initially betrothed to his first cousin Catherine Venables, who died young in 1680, he married Anne Ferrers on 27 September 1688. Her grandfather John Ferrers was the heir male of Ferrers of Groby, and Anne inherited from him Tamworth Castle and the rest of his estates. After his marriage, he mostly lived at Chartley Castle and at Staunton Harold. Shirley visited the family estate in Ireland (a moiety of the Barony of Farney, in County Monaghan) in the summer of 1698. On his return from Ireland, he proposed himself as a candidate for Staffordshire in the 1698 election in place of the retiring John Grey. He solicited the support of Sir Walter Bagot, 3rd Baronet, who had sat for the county until 1695, and his son Edward, but this forward proposal (the Staffordshire gentry had historically met and chosen candidates by consensus, to avoid the cost of a contested election) backfired. Edward had his own designs on the seat, and he wrote to many of the local gentry to inform them of Shirley's breach of protocol, asking them not to pledge their support until a meeting could be held. As the other sitting member, Henry Paget, intended to retain his seat, local support began to coalesce around Paget and Bagot. Nonetheless, Robert's father, Lord Ferrers, and his kinsman Viscount Weymouth continued actively soliciting support for Shirley and Bagot; the support of Whigs such as Philip Foley for Paget in 1693 had made him somewhat suspect among the Tories. Lord Ferrers, though a Tory, obtained the interest of the Whig Dukes of Shrewsbury and Newcastle on Robert's behalf, suggesting a fluid political affiliation. In August 1698, on the eve of the election, John Chetwynd held a meeting between the Shirleys and the Bagots at Ingestre to try to broker a last-minute compromise, in which one of the candidates would withdraw in exchange for an unopposed candidature at the next election. The compromise failed, and the contest may have gone to a poll; if so, Shirley was unsuccessful, and Paget and Bagot were elected. Shirley was interested in literature and science, and was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society on 11 January 1699. However, he did not long enjoy his membership, dying of smallpox on 25 February following. His wife Anne had died of the same illness in March 1698; both were buried at Staunton Harold. He left four children: \n* Robert Shirley, Viscount Tamworth (1692–1714) \n* Elizabeth Shirley, 14th Baroness Ferrers of Chartley (1694–1741) \n* Ferrers Shirley (5 July 1696 – 10 October 1712) \n* Thomas Shirley (3 July 1697 – 1708)"

  "text" : "Rolf von Goth (5 November 1906 – 9 November 1981) was a film actor from Windhoek in German Southwest Africa who settled and worked in Germany. After appearing in minor roles in several silent films such as Metropolis (1927) von Goth emerged as a prominent actor in the late 1920s. During the early 1930s he played a mixture of leading and supporting roles in films such as Once There Was a Waltz and A Shot at Dawn (1932) but his appearances began to decline during the Nazi era. By the outbreak of the Second World War he had almost entirely retired from film. von Goth switched to become a director of radio shows, becoming extremely successful in the format during the post-war years. He was married to the actress Karin Hardt."

  "text" : "Robert Hartwell Fiske was a writer, editor, and publisher of The Vocabula Review, an online journal about the English language, from 1999 until his death in 2016. He wrote several books about grammar and usage, including To the Point: A Dictionary of Concise Writing (Norton, 2014), The Dictionary of Unendurable English (Scribner, 2011), The Dimwit's Dictionary (Marion Street Press, 2011), and Elegant English (Vocabula Communications Company, 2014). The purpose of the site, according to Fiske, was to encourage clear English and to discourage careless English. Among the schools which had bought licenses to the site were Columbia University, Princeton University, and Stanford University. After Fiske's death of melanoma in 2016 at the age of 68, essayist Joseph Epstein said that Fiske was \"an unknown soldier in that most glorious and hopeless of wars, that against the ignorant and abusive use of language.\" He stated that Fiske's linguistic prescriptivism was not well-received by contemporary linguists. Reviewing Vocabula Bound, a collection of essays and poems culled from the The Vocabula Review, linguist Alan Kaye said it is \"far too prescriptivist in orientation for a sophisticated linguistic audience\". In the Canadian newspaper the National Post, a book reviewer said Fiske's Dictionary of Unendurable English would be enjoyed by \"word snobs and copy editors\" and would benefit those learning English. A book reviewer in the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail said that it is \"so passionate in the prescriptivist cause of smiting the lax and the uncaring that the book at times resembles a parody of itself\"."

  "text" : "Robert Lee Heard (April 10, 1930 – April 15, 2014) was an American writer, journalist and reporter for the Associated Press, who covered politics, government and sports news in Texas for the wire service. Heard was shot and wounded by Charles Whitman on August 1, 1966, while covering Whitman's attack on the University of Texas at Austin for the Associated Press. Heard received widespread praise for his series of reports on the integration of the Texas Longhorns football team. He also authored several books, focusing on sports and politics. Robert Heard was born in April 10, 1930, in Big Spring, Texas. His father was a Baptist preacher. He had three older brothers. Heard's parents, who had expected a baby girl, did not know what to name him. They decided to call him Robert Lee after General Robert E. Lee, at the urging of his two older brothers, who had just learned about the Civil War general in elementary school. Heard served in the United States Marines in the Korean War from 1951 to 1952. He returned to Texas after the war, where he obtained a law degree from Baylor University. He practiced law in Houston for two years before pursuing a career change to journalism. He initially worked as a journalist at the Waco Tribune-Herald in Waco, Texas, and the AP Long Beach, California. Heard was then hired as a reporter by the Associated Press in 1964. On August 1, 1966, Heard, who was 36 years old at the time, was shot in the arm while covering the mass shooting at the University of Texas at Austin. Heard, who had arrived on scene as a reporter for the Associated Press, was attempting to follow to Texas highway patrol offices across a parking lot when he was wounded by a bullet fired by Charles Whitman. In a 2006 interview with Texas Monthly, Heard recalled, \"Just before I reached the curb, I was shot down. I'd forgotten my Marine training; I hadn't zigzagged.\" He continued to grant interviews on the anniversary of the shooting, but attempted to distance his professional and personal life from the tragedy. According to his wife, Betsy Heard, \"He lived his whole life hoping to get that out of the first paragraph of his obituary.\" Heard eventually left the Associated Press, but continued to work in journalism and public relations. He worked as a press secretary for Joe Christie, a Democratic U.S. Senator candidate, during his campaign. Heard also wrote for the Texas Lawyer and served as the Texas State Capitol correspondent for the San Antonio Express News. Heard founded Inside Texas, a newsletter which covered athletics at the University of Texas.His books included \"Dance With Who Brung Us: Quips & Quotes from Darrell Royal,\" which compiled quotes from Darrell Royal, a former Texas Longhorns football coach. Heard also authored \"Miracle of the Killer Bees: 12 Senators Who Changed Texas Politics,\" which focused on twelve Texas state senators who fled Austin in 1979 and went into hiding to stop a bill. Robert Heard died from complications of hip surgery on April 15, 2014, at the age of 84. He was survived by his wife, Betsy Heard; a son, Tom Heard, from his first marriage to, Mary Lou Custer Heard, (another son, Dan, died in 1993) and brother, Wyatt Heard.

  "text" : "Rebecca Kellogg Ashley (December 22, 1695 – August 1757) was an English child captured by allied French, Canadian militia, Iroquois, and Algonquin soldiers in the 1704 Deerfield Raid. The Deerfield attack was part of the decade-long Queen Anne's War (the 1702-1713 War of Spanish Succession on the Continent). Rebecca was eight years old. Eunice Williams was captured in this same raid, as was her father, the Rev. John Williams who wrote about his captive experience in The Redeemed Captive. Like Eunice and several other children from Deerfield, Rebecca Kellogg was adopted by Haudenosaunee Mohawks in the town of Kahnawake. She married and she raised children. Unlike Eunice, Rebecca Kellogg returned to British colonial territory as an older woman. She married Ben Ashley and she translated for several Congregational missionaries in Indian missions, including the Rev. Jonathan Edwards at the Stockbridge Indian Mission. Edwards expressed in many letters his admiration of her faith and of her interpretation skills. Although she had left Kahnawake, she often lived with the Haudenosaunee and identified as a member of the Mohawk. Rebecca Kellogg Ashley died in 1757 with the Oneida Haudenosaunee in Oquaga, New York. She did not leave any writings that are known but her life is visible in the writings of the missionaries with whom she worked. The Rev. Gideon Hawley wrote that the Haudenosaunee “greatly lamented” her death."

He went on to study and graduate from Ivey Business School, Harvard University, and Stanford University. Quigg's construction and development companies operate under the \"Quintessentially Quigg\" brand, founded by him in 1986 and specializing in high-end residential and commercial developments. Quigg has been compared to mega-developers Nile Niami and Mohamed Hadid as competitors in the building and selling of luxury estates in Beverly Hills and Bel Air. Quigg's developments have fetched record-breaking sales, including the most expensive condo ever sold in British Columbia. In 2007, Quigg designed and launched a $1.4 billion development \"Capella by Quigg\" on Vancouver Island at Bear Mountain. In 2006, “The Properties by Quigg” created a new sustainable housing form, addressing the complexities of building multi-family homes in a steep mountainous setting. In 2005, his development \"The Argyle by Quigg\" won Best Waterfront Development in the International Property Awards. Quigg is a member of the Young Presidents Organization (YPO), the Urban Land Institute (ULI), and the Urban Development Institute (UDI). Quigg currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife Lauren Quigg and their children."

Dotson is the first American man who was  to be exonerated of a criminal conviction by DNA evidence. Samuels ordered Dotson back to prison, after the victim, Cathleen Mae Webb, of the alleged 1977 rape, recanted. Later Samuels upheld Dotson's conviction, because \"he believed the victim's original testimony.\" Richard L. Samuels retired in December 2000. Due to cancer, he died 4 months later, at the Age of 74, on April 14, 2001, in the Advocate South Suburban Hospital in Hazel Crest. He is buried at the Ridgewood Cemetery in Des Plaines."

They had been recruited as agricultural labourers from an English village named Sullington in West Sussex, and were indentured to work for Colonel Peter Latour for a period of seven years. Gallop married Margaret Drew in November 1842 and they had six children: Richard (born 1843), Mary (born 1846), Anne (born 1848), Thomas (born 1851), John (born 1854) and Walter Edward Joseph (born 1857). He established a market garden, an orchard and a vineyard on land he purchased on Brisbane Street in Perth and became a member of the Perth Horticultural Society in 1875. He was included in the list of 100 most influential West Australian business leaders (1829–2013) published in The West Australian newspaper, for his contribution to the development of agriculture in Western Australia. Gallop is the great great uncle of Geoff Gallop, Premier of Western Australia in the early 2000s."

Throughout his sporting career, Aghayev trained for Neftçi Sports Club in Baku, under his personal coach and mentor Dyevanshir Kurbanov. Aghayev qualified for his adopted Azerbaijan squad in the men's heavyweight class (96 kg) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by placing third and receiving a berth from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Bratislava, Slovakia. In the prelim pool, Aghayev eclipsed Kazakhstan's Islam Bairamukov with a 7–2 division on his opening bout, and grappled Namibia's Nico Jacobs into the ring at the peak of the first minute by an eleven-point advantage, earning him a spot for the quarterfinals. Followed by the next day's session, Aghayev could not push Iranian wrestler Alireza Heidari off the mat with a 5–0 defeat in the quarterfinal match, but offered a chance to redeem himself as he pinned China's Wang Yuanyuan in nearly a full minute for a fifth-place finish."

In 1973 he had a large commercial success with his directorial debut film, The Last Snows of Spring, a success confirmed by his second work, White Horses of Summer. These films launched a melodramatic subgenre known as \"lacrima movie\" (i.e. \"tearjerker movie\"), usually characterized by plots involving unfortunate children and fatal diseases. A strong sentimentalism was his trademark also in his later works, which indeed disappointed at the box office. Del Balzo died of cancer, as did the main characters of his first two films."

  "text" : "Rudolf Reder a.k.a. Roman Robak (April 4, 1881 in Dębica – 1968 in Toronto) was one of only two Holocaust survivors of the Bełżec extermination camp who testified about his experience after the war. He submitted a deposition to the Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in January 1946 in Kraków. In terms of the number of Polish Jews who perished in its gas chambers, Bełżec had the third highest death toll among the six Nazi death camps located in occupied Poland, estimated between 500,000 and 600,000 men, women and children. Only Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka had more victims. The postwar testimony of Reder was of special significance, because Chaim Hirszman who also survived Bełżec, joined the new communist militia in Stalinist Poland tasked with the crushing of Polish underground, torture, makeshift executions, and mass deportation to Siberia of over 50,000 political undesirables. Hirszman was shot in March 1946 at his residence by the Cursed soldiers from TOW, in the course of an anti-communist insurrection against the new reign of terror, before he was able to give a full account of his camp experience."

  "text" : "Rafael Barreno Martínez (born September 30, 1977 in Punto Fijo, Falcón) is an amateur Venezuelan Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's super heavyweight category. Considering one of South America's top Greco-Roman wrestlers in his decade, Barreno has claimed a prestigious gold medal at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, produced a staggering tally of four medals (one silver and three bronze) at the Pan American Games, and also represented as part of the Venezuelan team in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Barreno currently trains for Pena Gillit Wrestling Club in his native town Punto Fijo, under his personal coach Milcho Radulovski. Barreno made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's super heavyweight division (130 kg). He lost his opening match to Ukraine's Georgiy Saldadze by a tough 0–9 blowout, but redeemed himself to dismantle Australia's Laszlo Kovacs into the ring with a four-point advantage on his second bout. Finishing second in the prelim pool and twelfth overall in the final rankings, Barreno's performance fell short to put him further into the quarterfinals. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Barreno qualified for his second Venezuelan squad, as a 26-year-old, in the men's 120 kg class by placing fifth and receiving a berth from the first Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. Unlike his previous Games, Barreno suffered through a less tactical game plan as he lost two straight matches each to Armenia's fellow two-time Olympian Haykaz Galstyan with an arduous 3–9 decision, and France's Yannick Szczepaniak, who threw him off the mat by a technical superiority, in the prelim pool. Barreno failed again to advance further into the quarterfinals after finishing the pool in last place and sixteenth overall. Barreno sought to compete in two more editions of the Olympic Games (2008 and 2012), but missed a chance to earn a spot on the Venezuelan team through the Olympic Qualification Tournament. In 2010, Barreno emerged himself into the global and continental scene, as he took home his first gold in the super heavyweight division at the Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, thrashing Panama's Irving Herrera in the process. Because of his brilliant success, Barreno was officially named the Athlete of the Year by the Venezuelan Federation of Amateur Wrestling. The following year, Barreno continued to flourish his sporting career, as he picked up a silver medal on his final match against Cuban wrestler and defending Olympic champion Mijaín López at the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico, producing a stark record of four medals, including three bronze, to his career hardware."

Dublin and then to Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire), Co. Dublin, in Ireland. In 1879 she helped set up a committee for the establishment of a care facility for children, effectively a creche allowing women to enter the workforce. It eventually led to the establishment of The Cottage Home for Little Children which housed Protestant children. To avoid accusations of proselytising, the home did not accept Catholic children. Rosa Barrett founded the Irish section of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in 1889. In the 1901 census she lists her religion as a Congregationalist, her grandfather being a Congregationalist minister."

  "text" : "Rungsung Suisa (4 March 1907 – 17 April 1971) was an Indian politician. Suisa was one of the key figures in the movement to unite Naga-populated areas in Manipur with the Naga Hills (Nagaland). He was popularly known as 'Uncle Suisa'. He was the first Naga member of the parliament of India. Rungsung Suisa belonged to the Tangkhul Naga tribe. He was the son of Rungsung Luithui. He hailed from Somdal, Ukhrul district. He studied at the Jorhat Christian High School. He was amongst the first youths of the Manipur hill people to obtain matriculate education. Suisa was one of five hill leaders named by the President Manipur State Darbar to participate in the Constitution-Making Committee in 1946. However, Suisa and the other hill leaders did not attend the first session of the Committee. On 13 August 1947 he chaired a meeting of hill leaders, at which the assembled demanded that the hill peoples should have the right to secede from Manipur after a five-year period. However, these demands were not heeded by the Committee, and in the new constitution the administration of the hill areas was placed under the control of the Maharaja. In June 1948 he was elected unopposed to the Manipur State Assembly. In 1949 he visited Burma, and came into contact with the Communist Party of Burma. His experience in Burma radicalized his political approach, taking a more revolutionary stance in local politics upon his return. He became a member of the Manipur Electoral College in 1951. Suisa was elected to the Lok Sabha (lower house of the parliament of India) in the 1957 general election. He stood as the Indian National Congress candidate in Outer Manipur constituency, obtaining 21,316 votes (26.24% of the votes in the constituency). In parliament, he was represented in various committees. The Manipur Naga Council boycotted the 1962 general election and Suisa was one of the Naga leaders that was detained at Dum Dum for about a year. Suisa was assistant to the vice president of the Naga National Council 1964-1966. In October 1966, following the deadlock in the peace talks, he presented a proposal to solve the Indo-Naga conflict through confederation, with shared responsibilities between India and Nagaland on foreign and military affairs, but full Naga sovereignty on internal affairs. He sought to mediate between the Indian government and the Naga leaders. Allegedly, Indira Gandhi was open to accept Suisa's proposal. However, the NNC opposed these moves and did not accept his proposal, as it went against their demand of complete independence. Suisa had travelled to London together with Vizol in June 1967 to present the proposal to Angami Zapu Phizo but it was rebuffed by him."

  "text" : "Russell Wilson (July 1864 – November 13, 1936) was a politician and merchant in Saskatchewan, Canada. He had served as a member of the Saskatoon's city council and went on to become the city's mayor in 1926. Wilson was born near Almonte, Ontario to Robert and Jane Wilson. He received his education in Carleton County and, with his family, homesteaded on Beaver Creek near Hanley in 1883. The family had bought 190 acres of land in Beaver Creek. After leaving home, Wilson worked in Moose Jaw, as guide for the transport department during the North-West Rebellion and served as a railway contractor along with his brother from 1884 to 1885. Wilson started merchandising in dray in 1883. From 1893 to 1896, he traded in food and livery along with H. McDonald. Wilson and his brothers sold the property after their parents moved to Saskatoon in 1899. After selling their property Wilson continued his business in partnership with his brother Archibald. The two brothers started Wilson Bros., a livery business; they later sold the company and began trading in carriages, harnesses and automobiles. In 1908, he married Ida Dunham of Brockville. Wilson served as the director of the Saskatoon Milling Company (later sold to Quaker Oats), and the Northwestern Telephone Company. He also served on the Soldier Land Settlement Board in 1919, and on Saskatoon's city council from 1923 to 1925. Wilson was a member of the Saskatoon School Board from 1906 to 1910 and from 1911 to 1912. After the University of Saskatchewan was established in 1907, Wilson became a member of the University's senate in 1914. In the November of 1925, Wilson was elected mayor of Saskatoon by acclamation, succeeding William Harvey Clare. After he suffered two strokes, the city's council granted him a leave of absence in September 1926. He was the shortest-serving mayor in Saskatoon's history. George Wesley Norman succeeded him. After suffering another stroke Wilson died in 1936. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery. His brother James served as the first mayor of Saskatoon after it was incorporated as a town on July 1, 1903.In 2006 it was found that a joint account (which he shared with a priest) had a total of $938.06 in it and the amount had remained unclaimed for the past 77 years. The account was not interest-bearing, so the balance had not changed since 1929. Whether the account has been claimed or not is unknown."

  "text" : "Robert Martin Gumbura is the pastor of RMG End Time Message, a Zimbabwean church and a convicted rapist. He was convicted of four counts of rape and one on possession of pornographic material. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison and he is currently serving his sentence at Zimbabwe's notorious Chikurubi Prison. His church was also suspended by Zimbabwe's religious body, ACCZ, for \"Satanic practices\" and for the child abuse allegations against Robert Gumbura. Parliament is currently seeking to permanently ban the church. Born in Kenzamba, Zimbabwe on the 29th of July 1956, he is alleged to have abused his congregants for over 30 years. Robert Martin Gumbura of the RMG Independent End Time Message Church had given himself the authority to have sex with any female congregant of his choice in his church regardless of their marital status and could “loan” them out to their husbands, but still retain certain rights. These rights included him being able to continue to have sexual intercourse with any women, despite their marital status.Gumbura was viewed as God in the church and indoctrinated his followers into believing that God directly communicated with him and gave him authority to do as he pleased. He said the church had songs composed in praise of Gumbura. A leaked WhatsApp messages between two women who consented to having sex with Gumbura, despite one of them being a married woman, revealed that of all the countless women Gumbura had sex with, he only used a condom on just one woman, who was said to be very beautiful but risky - the rest sampled his anaconda \"live and direct\". In the leaked WhatsApp chat a married woman and that woman's daughter once took turns to have sex with Gumbura. He span of control expanded all over Zimbabwe, and also in overseas countries such as the Leeds in the UK. On the 18th of March 2015, VICE-PRESIDENT and Justice minister Emmerson Mnangagwa told Parliament that jailed RGM Independent End Time Message church leader Robert Martin Gumbura — who is serving a 40-year jail term for rape — was among over 100 inmates who planned the violent food riots that broke out at Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison one Friday. Stating \"“Surprisingly also, Gumbura was chairing that conspiracy at the compound area where meals are served and the mutiny was over the issue of there being no meat in their relish.”"

He was a profligate rake and was obliged to make over his inheritance to his younger brother Charles following court judgements against him for adultery. In 1741 he was elected MP for Bossiney but unseated on petition after a few months. He was, however, reseated on further petition, sitting until his death in 1746. In 1745 he was made a Privy Counsellor in Ireland and appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, a position he held until his death. He was also MP for Jamestown in the Parliament of Ireland from 1745 until his death. He died unmarried."

Before his wrestling career ended in 2009, Scherrer trained full-time for Ringerclub Willisau under his personal coach Erwin Mühlemann. Scherrer made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's heavyweight division (97 kg). He lost his opening match 1–7 to Iran's Alireza Heidari, but wrestled his way to overwhelm Turkey's Ahmet Doğu with a vigorous 4–3 verdict. Placing second in the prelim pool and tenth overall, Scherrer's performance was not enough to advance him to the quarterfinals. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Scherrer qualified for his second Swiss squad, as a 32-year-old, in the men's heavyweight class (96 kg) by placing fifth and receiving a berth from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Bratislava, Slovakia. Unlike his previous Olympics, Scherrer suffered through a disastrous game plan, as he lost two straight matches each to Ukraine's Vadim Tasoyev (1–6), and Russia's Khadzhimurat Gatsalov (0–3), leaving him on the bottom pool and placing sixteenth overall."

Before his wrestling career ended in 2009, Bucher trained as a member of the wrestling team for Ringerstaffel Freiamt in Aristau, under his personal coach Leonz Küng. A member of the Swiss wrestling squad, Bucher entered the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens as an underdog in the men's 74 kg class, after placing third and receiving a berth from the final Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. He opened his match by dominating Belarusian wrestler Aliaksandr Kikiniou with a 3–2 verdict, and then rallied for a 6–2 score over China's Sai Yinjiya in the prelim pool to move into the next round. Bucher edged past his Kazakh rival Danil Khalimov in the quarterfinals, before being tamed by eventual silver medalist Marko Yli-Hannuksela of Finland at 3–0, leaving him with an ankle injury. Fighting against Russia's Varteres Samurgashev for the bronze medal, Bucher could not endure a pain from his injury and easily lost the match to the Russian due to a 10–0 superiority limit. Bucher lost again to Hannuksela for the bronze medal in the same division at the 2005 World Wrestling Championships in Budapest, Hungary, until his medal drought culminated with a silver at the European Championships in 2007. He also sought to compete for his second Swiss team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, but missed out a spot from the Olympic trials. In 2009, Bucher announced his official retirement from the sport because of a right knee injury sustained from the Swiss championships."

When they arrived there was a crowd which carried Jones to Pioneer Hall where Joe Ulmer gave a welcome speech. He stayed in the area, using Northbird to operate under the name Northbird Aviation Company. The airline did not prosper, as Jones crashed the flying boat in Heckman Lake in 1923. Jones continued living in Ketchikan until 1928. Jones later became involved with another Alaskan airline, joining Vern C. Gorst and C.R. Wright to form Pioneer Airways in 1930. A veteran of World War I as a pilot, during World War II Jones joined the United States Army Air Forces, being stationed at Ladd Field, Fairbanks, from where he retired as a Major in the reserves post-war. Jones died in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1974."

He served on the board of directors for the Royal Jubilee Hospital. Porter was defeated by William M. Marchant when he ran for reelection as mayor in 1921, in part due to a smear campaign led by prohibitionist Christopher Rowland \"Joe\" North, who accused Parker of being involved with gambling and rum-running. After the election, North was successfully sued for accusations of wrongdoing he had made during the campaign and he was later arrested after he made slanderous remarks against the local police. He died of pneumonia at the age of 55 just four months after the election. Robert J. Porter Park was named in his honour."

He investigated spectral bands of evaporated water and infrared and Raman spectroscopy of small organic molecules. He proved the existence of the spin onto rotary oscillation spectra of molecules. 1937 he became professor for theoretical physics at the university of Freiburg and investigated there hydrogen bonds by infrared spectroscopy. 1942 he became ordinary professor and director of the Institute for Physical Chemistry. Additionally, he was in 1958 the founder and until 1968 the director of the Institute for electric materials (Institut für Elektrowerkstoffe) of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft and the head of the Institute for Physical Chemistry. 1963 he retired in Freiburg. 1964 he became member of the Leopoldina. 1965 he received the Bunsen medal.He was co-author of the Handbuch der Physik by Geiger and Scheel.

In 2008, Pople won the Sir John Sulman Prize with a work entitled Stage Fright. In 2010, works in an exhibition entitled \"Bellini 21c\" were the focus of protests. The works included images of Bellini's San Zaccaria Altarpiece overlaid with pornography. Pople won the Glover Prize for landscape painting in March 2012 with a work that included the figure of Martin Bryant, the convicted perpetrator of the Port Arthur Massacre in the foreground of the landscape of Port Arthur. Later in that year, a work entitled \"Degas's Night\" which included Degas' sculpture Little Dancer of Fourteen Years on the background of red-light district in Darlinghurst, New South Wales was also the cause of controversy. He was an Archibald Prize finalist in 2014 and 2015."

  "text" : "Ross Gardler (born 10 December 1969 in Dundee, Scotland), is an open source software advocate who volunteers time to many open source projects and initiatives, in particular to the Apache Software Foundation. He is a Director and President of the Apache Software Foundation. He is a committer on a number of Apache projects, though is more often seen providing community support than code. He can also be found in other projects and foundations acting as a mentor or community contributor. Gardler's original career was as a manager and sound engineer for a well respected though \"undiscovered\" Dub Reggae band in Manchester, UK called C-Charge. This early music career lasted around eight years and ended with Ross selling the record label and management company he had created in order to return to formal education and study computer science in 1995. It is during these studies that Ross first became involved in open source, initially as a user and later as a contributor where he claims that studying, using and contributing to open source software is far more educational than any of his other undertakings]. Upon completing his undergraduate degree he went on to study for a PhD. in the field of component based software composition. In 2003 Ross married Heidi-Marie Brannan and the newlyweds moved to Trinidad and Tobago where Ross became a lecturer at the University of the West Indies. Here he worked to bring open source into his lecture series while creating the countries first native open source project (the now defunct Burrokeet e-learning content editor). He received an IBM Innovation Award in recognition of this work in 2004. This award enabled Ross to return to the UK with his now pregnant wife and focus on his open source contributions. He acted as the Apache Software Foundations Google Summer of Code administrator in its first and many subsequent years. This work led to the creation of the Apache Community Development Project in 2009 where Gardler acted as the first Vice President of Community Development. This project continues to manage the foundations engagement with mentoring programs and other such activities. In 2007 Ross and family moved to Oxford, UK where he took on the role of Manager at OSS Watch the publicly funded open source advisory service for the UK Higher and Further Education sector. In 2011 he again returned to consulting work and in 2013 he and his family moved to Redmond, WA as Ross joined Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft which exists to \"further advance the company’s long-standing investments in openness including interoperability, open standards and open source.\". Shortly after joining Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc. the Apache Software Foundation board elected Gardler to act as President of the foundation where he had previously served as a Committer, Member, Vice President, Director and Executive Vice President. Ross continues in this role today."

He was born at Lavenham, Suffolk and died at Cambridge. Johnson was the eldest son of the rector of Lavenham, also named Richard Johnson, and his wife, the former Mary Ann Cubitt. He was educated at Bury St Edmunds Grammar School and at Clare College, Cambridge. He was followed to Cambridge and into the cricket team there by his younger brother, George Randall Johnson – whose son, Peter Randall Johnson, took the same path 50 years later and was then a famous Somerset cricketer. Johnson played cricket for Cambridge University in two matches, one each at home and away, against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1850, batting as a middle-order batsman. It is not recorded whether he batted right-handed or left-handed and the scorecards for both matches are incomplete, and so it is not recorded that he bowled, but if he did, he took no wickets. His top score of 28 came in the match at Lord's. Johnson died suddenly at Cambridge from typhoid fever while still an undergraduate; his close friend Edmund Keble White, who had been at school with him and was at Trinity College, Cambridge – their fathers had been fellows at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge – also died in the same typhoid outbreak."

  "text" : "Richard Clinton (1741-1795) was an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution, a member of the North Carolina General Assembly, Register of Deeds for Duplin County and prominent citizen of Sampson County. Richard Clinton is thought to be the step-son of Lieutenant General John Sampson (a member of the council for Josiah Martin) who it is thought to have moved to the Wilmington, North Carolina area around 1736. Lieutenant General John Sampson married Clinton's mother sometime after 1741 when Clinton was born. Around 1762, Clinton's step-father John Sampson built on home on a plantation he purchased near the present day town of Clinton, North Carolina. At this point in history, this area was still a part of Duplin County; however residents had to go many miles east to the nearest courthouse. After the family's move into Duplin County, Richard Clinton became the Register of Deeds for the county from 1773-1883. After the establishment of the Independent State Government of North Carolina by the Halifax Constitution in 1776, Richard Clinton became one of the earliest members of the North Carolina House of Commons. It was during his tenure in the House of Commons that Clinton was able to secure the passage of a bill that created Sampson County from the western portion of Duplin County. Richard Clinton proposed the name of \"Sampson\" for the new county in honor of his step-father. In 1784, this new act was passed by the House of Commons and the first courts were ordered to take place at the home of James Myland just west of the current town of Clinton, North Carolina."

  "text" : "Richard Selvey Clinton (born 1 September 1981) is an English cricketer. He is a left-handed batsman and occasional right-arm medium-pace bowler. Born in Sidcup, Kent, he made his first-class debut for Essex against Surrey in 2001. He batted at number six in the first innings, making 36, but opened the batting in the second and hit 58 not out. His List A debut a few days later was also personally successful, albeit in a losing cause, as he scored 56 from 57 balls against Durham; as of June 2006, this remains his highest List A score. Clinton made his maiden first-class hundred (107) against Cambridge UCCE in 2002, but left the county at the end of the season. He moved to Surrey in 2004 to replace Jonathan Batty as opening batsman. For the following season he competed actively for the opening batsman's position with James Benning and was given a new two-year contract at the end of 2004. Clinton enjoyed a long run in the team in 2005, hitting 811 first-class runs at 31.39 and hitting two centuries and five fifties. However, he made only three appearances in the one-day game, aggregating only 21 runs from these. He has also made several first-class appearances for Loughborough UCCE, having graduated from Loughborough University in 2006. His father Grahame had a significant first-class career with Kent and Surrey, while his cousin Paul has played a handful of first-class games for Oxford UCCE."

He has also attempted K2, Gasherbrum II, and Dhaulagiri. A team unsupported West to East ski traverse of Greenland expanded his interests into the polar regions. In January 2010, Ryan and Cecilie Skog completed a \"nice long ski tour\" in Antarctica. The team skied 1,117 miles/1,800 kilometers over 70 days from Berkner Island in the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf to the South Pole, then continued to the Ross Sea and set a new record by completing the first ski traverse of Antarctica without resupplies or the use of kites. He and fellow explorer Eric Larsen reached the North Pole on May 4, 2014 after skiing unsupported for 53 days from Cape Discovery, Canada. This expedition was made into a 2-hour documentary titled Melting: Last Race to the Pole, for Animal Planet television network. In September 2015 he and Larsen also made the first ascent of 6,166m Jabou Ri in the Rolwaling area of Nepal."

  "text" : "Ray Kimble (born April 19, 1953) is an American track and field athlete and former collegiate football player for Washington State University. His primary event is the triple jump. He is the current M40 world record holder. His M45 best is 47 cm superior to the listed world record, but has never been ratified. \"Fourth place\" describes his attempts to reach the Olympics and World Championships, as that was the place he finished twice at the U.S. Olympic Trials, 1984 and 1992. In the 1984 he was beaten by the future gold medalist Al Joyner, silver medalist and 1992 gold medalist Mike Conley, Sr. and future world record holder Willie Banks, in 1992 it was Conley again and silver medalist Charles Simpkins (who he had beaten in 1984). He also finished seventh in 1988. Only the top three go to the Olympics. He suffered the same fate at the 1983 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, the qualifier for the first World Championships in Athletics, beaten by the same three competitors as in 1984. He did represent the United States internationally at the 1991 Pan American Games, where he finished fourth. By that time he was already 38 years old. He continued jumping in top level competition against competitors young enough to be his children well into his 40's. \"We joke about it. At 40, there are more important things in life than the triple jump. It is just an aspect of what I do. I can look back and say I had fun. Rather than become frustrated, you just take the good with the bad. I learned that from my family a long time before I started participating in sports.\" After growing up in California, Kimble went to high school in Texarkana, Arkansas. He was a starting wide receiver and occasional defensive back at Washington State, graduating in 1976. There he used jumping on the track team as an excuse to avoid spring training with the football team. He retired from jumping after college and took a job teaching physical education at Barnard White Middle School in Union City, California. He returned to jumping in 1980. More frustration, his personal best was a wind aided 17.65 m (57 ft 10 3⁄4 in), which if it had been legal would still rank #33 on the world all time list. At the time it would have been in the all time top ten. His legal personal best was 17.36 m (56 ft 11 1⁄4 in), +1.3 at the Modesto Relays and is still #14 on the US all time list."

  "text" : "Mehran Azma, who creates works under the alias R. Barrows, is an American musician, designer, writer, editor, producer and radio-show host. Born in the USA, he spent the latter half of the 90s singing and playing guitar in post-punk act The Nightmare Syndicate, who toured and supported acts like The Murder City Devils, The Blood Brothers, The Rapture and others, and was a touring guitarist for the punk band Swindle in the Southern California area. During this time, he was also the editor-in-chief of online music publication Light Up The Sky  and contributing writer for OC Weekly. After the dissolution of his previous efforts, he attended Otis College of Art and Design where he received his BA in Graphic Design  and continued to play music as bassist and vocalist of Baby's Breath, and released solo material under the moniker Nevers. In 2011, he relocated to Portland, Oregon and began hosting a weekly radio show called Past Haunts on local radio-station PRA. After the closure of the station due to financial stress, the show was moved to House of Sound where he continues to host on Sunday mornings. In 2013, he also began co-hosting a second radio show entitled Echo's Answer on KXRY 107.1 FM & 91.1 FM. In 2014, he launched SINIS Recordings and released the first record on the label by Warm Hands. In 2015, he marked the end of Echo's Answer and transitioned Past Haunts onto XRAY.FM, where he continues to broadcast weekly."

His most popular work, The Sweetest Story Ever Told, was published in 1892 and was still popular into the 20th century. According to the Morrison family history, he was the son of Jacob Stults and Martha-Jane Morrison. The first of five children, he was born on June 1, 1861 in Hightstown, N.J.. He was married to Julia Vandermeer. Prior to 1910, Stults mostly wrote popular music, but after 1910, he wrote more sacred and bigger works. He also used aliases for some of his works, such as the name \"Norwood Dale\" to write the musical \"The Cross Patch Fairies\". He also wrote three ragtime tunes, Smoky Sam (1898), Walkin' on de Rainbow Road (1899), and A Moonlight Meander (1900), under the name S. M. Roberts (a play on his name Robert M. Stults). The giveaway that these are his is that the last one, \"A Moonlight Meander\", was copyrighted by his wife, J. V. Stults, who often copyrighted his music. At his death on March 24, 1933, he, along with Louis M. Bennet, was the publisher of the Long Branch [N.J.] Daily Record. This is a list of works that are mostly songs and piano tunes, written prior to 1910: This is a list of works that are sacred in nature or longer works. These were generally written after 1910:"

Palmer was the first person appointed to the BBC's predecessor, the British Broadcasting Company, by Lord Reith. On leaving the BBC in 1929, to join the Gramophone Company, he was described by the Evening News as \"one of the original five members of the BBC\". At the Gramophone Company, where he rose to be general manager of the International Artistes' Department, he oversaw recordings for the His Master's Voice (HMV) label, by conductors and composers including Sir Edward Elgar and Arturo Toscanini. On 11 October 1931, he introduced the first English-language radio programme in France, which was sponsored by HMV and made by the International Broadcasting Company. He left HMV in 1940. He also narrated films for British Pathé. He also served with the Royal Flying Corps under Edmund Allenby in Palestine, and rejoined the Royal Air Force (as it had become) in World War II, eventually becoming a Wing Commander. He appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 10 February 1958. In November 2008, his papers were auctioned by Bonhams."

  "text" : "Reuben Moulthrop (1763-1814) was an early American artist based in East Haven, Connecticut. During his lifetime Moulthrop was famous for the wax figures that he arranged in tableaux (which at the time were so popular that they were even exported to the West Indies), but he is known to posterity through his portraits, which are in many important collections, including those of the American Folk Art Museum, the Detroit Institute of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the New York Historical Society. He was only twenty years old when the Revolutionary War ended: although his life spanned from colonial America to the new republic, his career coincided with the early decades of national independence. Though his earliest documented works, the portraits of Sarah and Job Perit in the Metropolitan Museum, date from 1790, earlier works, such as the portraits of Mary and James Reynolds in the American Folk Art Museum, have been attributed to the artist. Ezra Stiles, the president of Yale College from 1778-1795, praised Moulthrop as a \"self taught painter\" who \"pleased with his genius,\" which suggests how esteemed Moulthrop's work was by the ruling class of the new republic, where there was as yet little art to see. Moulthrop's work thus contributed to the establishment of an early standard. Moulthrop's work is an early example of the adaptation of the European form of portraiture to American realities; it testifies to the development of European-style bourgeois culture on the American frontier. Moulthrop's work evinces the influence of the Colonial painter John Durand, who had been active in East Haven as well as in New York and Virginia. In turn he was a likely influence on the Connecticut-born portraitist Ammi Phillips, whose namesake the Reverend Ammi Ruhamah Robbins was painted by Moulthrop.A retrospective devoted to Moulthrop's work at the Connecticut Historical Society in 1956-1957 revealed unlikely inconsistencies in the oeuvre attributed to Moulthrop. It is therefore difficult to assign works to Moulthrop with certainty."

He subsequently attended the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied viola under Lionel Tertis and conducting under Sir Henry Wood. He worked on radio programmes, including It's That Man Again (ITMA). He was also an authority on music of gypsy origin. He appeared as a \"castaway\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 6 September 1965. He was a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) and a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music (FRAM). A portrait of Jenkins was painted by William Redgrave.

El-Kaliouby is currently the chief science officer of Affectiva, leading the company’s Emotion Science team.

  "text" : "Rob Potylo (born Louis Robert Potylo, September 3, 1976), is a Boston, Massachusetts-based musician, comedian, and entertainment producer. Since 2009, Potylo has produced and appeared in five seasons of an ongoing cable and online series about the Boston arts and music scene, Quiet Desperation. He is the son of Louis and Patricia Potylo of Danvers, Massachusetts. Originally the lead singer of the band the Sweatpant Boners which was a metal/hard rock band formed with Ken Susi of Unearth and Adam Dutkiewicz of Killswitch Engage. They released one album in 2001 titled \"Cruisin' With The Masters\". Potylo formed his own band in 2005 called Robby Roadsteamer with Dave Pino of Andrew WK and has toured the United States behind his album Postcards From the Den Of Failure, including the Warped Tour. The band came in second in the WBCN (FM) Rock & Roll Rumble. Roadsteamer received nationwide radio airplay and was featured on VH1's Best Week Ever for his single \"I Put a Baby In You.\"The character he developed \"Robby Roadsteamer\" is part Tony Clifton, part pro wrestler; usually appearing onstage in a wig, fake mustache and sunglasses. Roadsteamer was a disc jockey on WBCN until he was fired in early May 2008. Roadsteamer's band has been nominated for \"Live Band of the Year\" at the Boston Music Awards three times. The September 28, 2006 issue of the Boston Phoenix describes a Robby Roadsteamer skit performed at that years Boston Music Awards. \"On the program it was clearly marked \"comedy routine,\" but it still killed: Robby Roadsteamer storms on stage dropping f-bombs, announces an award he's nominated for, mercilessly insults the other nominees, calls the BMA's \"plastic,\" heckles the hecklers, then absconds with the trophy, leaving his sidekick Aaron the King Wizard to deliver a hilarious (because it's true) monologue about the lack of black faces on stage -- partly at the expense of EJ Labb, the show-opening gay-white-girl rapper. \"The only black people in this motherfucker are me and the bear,\" he screams. \"Get the fuck up here, bear!\" We thinks the \"comedy\" departed from the script, since there was an uncomfortable pause after Aaron left the stage; eventually the Snowleopards were announced as the actual winners for local song of the year, whereupon they were handed one of the Dresden Dolls' spare trophies. For all we know, Robby's still got theirs. Recommended course of action: ban Roadsteamer from playing shows. Hire him as permanent BMAs emcee.\""

  "text" : "Robert Conroy (1811 – April 5, 1868) was an Irish-born business owner and politician in Quebec. He served as mayor of Aylmer from 1858 to 1860 and from 1866 to 1868. He was considered one of the most prosperous hotel operators and lumber barons in the Ottawa Valley during the 1850s. Born in Magherafelt in County Londonderry, Conroy arrived in the Ottawa region in 1830. In 1834 (some sources say 1838) he built the British Hotel in Aylmer. Conroy partnered with John Egan, Charles Symmes and Harvey Parker in the operation of a steam-powered flour mill. He was also a partner with Egan, Richard McConnell and Joseph-Ignace Aumond in the Bytown and Aylmer Union Turnpike Company which completed the Britannia Road (later known as the Aylmer Road) connecting Bytown, Hull and Aylmer to aid in the transport of lumber. Conroy built a sawmill in the Aylmer area which formed the nucleus for the development of the village of Deschênes, now a neighbourhood in the city of Gatineau. Conroy was one of the prominent timber kings of his era who were consulted by the Canadian government during the development of the Crown Timber Act of 1849, which was the first legislation in Canada regulating the use of forest resources on Crown lands. He was a director of the Ottawa Association of Lumber Manufacturers and held extensive timber cutting rights on the Madawaska River and other parts of Renfrew County, Ontario. Conroy was president of the Madawaska River Improvement Company, formed to build timber slides and other structures to aid in the transport of logs on that river. During the 1850s, he bought the Aylmer Hotel, later the Auberge Symmes, from Charles Symmes. He also operated a general store in Aylmer. Conroy served as a captain in the militia for Ottawa County and was a prominent member of the local Masons. When the Prince of Wales visited Aylmer in 1860, Conroy was a member of the group that drafted the address of welcome. He married Mary McConnell in 1837 and, in 1841, they moved into an apartment in the British Hotel, where they lived until 1845 when construction of his first home was completed. Conroy died in office at the age of 56 and his wake was held at the British Hotel. Some sources say that the assassin of Thomas D'Arcy McGee fled to Aylmer to hide himself among those gathered for Conroy's wake. His son William later also served as Aylmer mayor and another son Robert Hughes Conroy served as mayor of Hull South. Conroy's former residence has been designated as a heritage building by Quebec. Conroy Island, an island in the Ottawa River, was named after Robert Conroy and his family."

  "text" : "Robert (Bob) Story (19 August 1913 Fort Beaufort – 20 February 1999 Australia) was a South African botanist and ecologist. His father, who died in 1925, was a farm manager who had studied at Edinburgh University and obtained a Diploma in Agriculture. After spending 1926-30 at Grey High School in Port Elizabeth, Robert Story attended Rhodes University from 1931-33 where he obtained a B.Sc., after which he enrolled at Witwatersrand University from 1934-35 where he graduated with an M.Sc. and was later awarded a D.Sc. His first appointment was to the Leeuwkuil Pasture Research Station near Vereeniging in 1936. During World War II he saw service in Madagascar, North Africa and Italy. At the close of the War in 1945 he was transferred to the Botanical Survey Section of the Division of Botany and stationed at Grahamstown. Here he carried out a botanical survey of the Keiskammahoek District and it was published as 'Botanical Survey of South Africa Memoir No. 27' in 1952. In the same year he relocated to Pretoria as Officer in Charge of the Botanical Survey Section. He accompanied the Harvard-Smithsonian-Peabody expedition to Botswana and South-West Africa in 1955, revisiting the region in 1956 and 1958 and travelling through the Kaokoveld to the Kunene River. As a result of these trips he published 'Some Plants Used by the Bushmen in Obtaining Food and Water' in 1958 as 'Botanical Survey of South Africa Memoir No. 30'. Robert Story with his wife Sybil and daughters emigrated to Australia in July 1959 where he took up a position in Canberra with the Land Use Research Division of CSIRO as ecologist and botanist. He was appalled at the environmental damage that was being done in the Hunter Valley near Lake George. During 1969-70 he was posted to Patagonia on an environmental training mission, a trip which in his opinion was a waste of time. He was convinced that rampant population growth lay at the root of most environmental problems. He, Nancy Burbidge, Alec Baillie Costin and a few other botanists  were instrumental in the 1960 founding of the National Parks Association of the Australian Capital Territory, and was one of the first Presidents of the NPA in the 1960s, as well as being a founding member of the Kosciuszko Huts Association and its President during the years 1973-76. His specimens number some 5000, and were collected in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. He is commemorated in Acacia storyi Tindale and Paenula storyi Orchard. The standard author abbreviation Story is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Rana Ellen Munns FAA and ISI highly cited, is recognised as a world-leading authority on the mechanisms of salinity tolerance in crop plants. Her primary research has been on dissecting and demonstrating the relative importance of traits that underpin salinity tolerance. She characterised the critical plant processes involved in tolerance of salinity, and showed what distinguishes salinity stress from drought stress. This work produced a highly sensitive technique for identifying salt-tolerant plants, and discovery of important genes for salt tolerance. Recently she discovered novel genes in an ancestral wheat that control the uptake of sodium and prevent it accumulating in leaves. These genes are being transferred to durum wheat and bread wheat cultivars, with the aim of improving grain yield in saline soil. The work resulted in developing a breeding line which yields 25% more than its parent on saline soils in farmers' fields."

On October 6, 1978, her daughter, Patricia Julia Roisinblit, who was eight months pregnant, was kidnapped with her (Patricia's) husband, José Manuel Pérez Rojo, by a task force of the Argentine Air Force. Both were members of the Montoneros. It is presumed that both were killed in the context of illegal repression that took place in Argentina during the military dictatorship self-styled National Reorganization Process. Her grandson, born in captivity on November, 15 of that year was given to Air Force civilian worker Francisco Gómez and his wife to raise as their own; he was found in 2000.

His cricket at Cambridge was limited to two games for the university against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in which he batted in the lower middle order and does not appear to have bowled: in both cases, the full scorecard has not survived, and it is not known if he was right- or left-handed. There was no University Match against Oxford in the 1837 season. After leaving Cambridge, Longden was ordained as a Church of England priest; he was curate at Groton, Suffolk from 1851 and rector of Brent Eleigh, also in Suffolk, from 1860 until his death in 1895. The account of his funeral in the Bury and Norwich Post newspaper indicates that he was married and had three sons."

  "text" : "Robert Greenlees (1820–1894) was a Scottish artist and educationalist. He was employed at the Glasgow School of Art as a pupil teacher, both teaching and studying. Greenlees taught drawing in the elementary classes, and became the Second Master. In 1863 the headmaster of the school, Charles Heath Wilson, retired and Greenlees was appointed his successor. He was the headmaster until 1881. Initially Greenlees worked in stained glass. He later moved to landscape painting in oils and watercolours. Greenlees advocated for the attendance of women pupils at life classes, and appointed four female teachers at the school. His daughter Georgina was one of the teachers. Greenlees also introduced the teaching of nautical draughtsmanship- a number of designers at the Clyde shipyards were graduates of the school. One of his pupils was the landscape artist Alexander Brownlie Docharty."

  "text" : "Rinaldo di Calvi was an Italian painter of the time of Renaissance. Born in Calvi dell'Umbria, he learned the craft from his father, Pancrazio Jacobetti. His works are influenced by the painter Lo Spagna. Documents show he painted a gonfalone for the city of Foglia. In 1521, he painted an altarpiece for the chapel of Sant'Antonio di Padova for the Convent of San Bernardo. In 1523, he painted for the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Calvi, where he met the painter Benvenuto da Vasciano. He is best known for his large altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin for the sacristy of the church of San Nicolo in Stroncone (Terni). He likely died from the plague circa 1528."

In 2013, she was arrested for and pleaded guilty to drunk driving. She was sentenced to forty-five days in jail. According to Lehmberg's lawyer, David Sheppard, Lehmberg's sentence was \"without doubt the harshest sentence anyone has ever received for first time DWI\" in Travis County. Video of her detainment and extremely inebriated and aggressive behavior was released to the public. Governor Rick Perry asked that she resign her position lest he be forced to use his constitutional veto to remove all funding to the Public Accountability Office which is under her authority. Lehmberg refused, and Governor Perry vetoed the office's funding. The governor was indicted for this action but was later cleared of all charges, and Lehmberg's term as DA ends in December 2016."

  "text" : "Raffaello Botticini (1474–1520) was an Italian Renaissance painter. Not much is known about Botticini's life, except through his works. His father was the painter Francesco Botticini. Raffaello he was first assistant, later successor at the helm of his father's workshop. The Tabernacle of the Sacrament, commissioned to his father Francesco in 1484 and delivered in 1491 to be placed on the altar of the collegiate church of Sant'Andrea in Empoli, now in the Museum of the city, is considered the official passing of the baton between father and son. Also in Empoli are two tables with Saint Jerome and Saint Sebastian, dating back to around 1500, from the Society of St. Andrew in the Collegiate. The tables show a stylistic influence of Florentine painting of the last part of the fifteenth century (primarily Domenico Ghirlandaio and Bastiano Mainardi). Also produced for the Collegiate are two panels with St. John the Baptist and Saint Andrew (1506). Most likely these are the only two surviving parts of a larger altarpiece that was destroyed, perhaps on the occasion of the modernization of the Collegiate. The Museo di Fucecchio houses the Annunciation with Saints Andrew and Francis, dated in the first decade of the sixteenth century. The original provenance of the work still has not yet been ascertained, perhaps the church of Sant'Andrea and San Salvatore, both in Fucecchio. The church of St. Martin and St. Justus, in Lucardo, in the municipality of Montespertoli, keeps a painting attributed to Botticini of the Madonna and Child with Saints Peter, Matthew, Justus and John the Baptist."

Godley designed ties for gentleman’s bespoke clothier Turnbull & Asser in London from 1996–97 and Drakes of London from 1997-2004 before being asked to the United States from London to serve as Creative Director for Polo Ralph Lauren. In 2005, Godley founded Psycho Bunny with friend and business partner Robert Goldman. Psycho Bunny \"uses English silks made in a 270-year-old mill that are then sewn by hand in Mr. Goldman's family-owned third-generation tie workshop in Belleville, N.J. The collection has grown to include polo shirts, swim trunks and socks.\"  Handmade from English silk, Psycho Bunny neckwear features everything from tiny spades to Donnie Darko-style rabbit skulls, the latter inspiring the label's oddball name. \"When I showed that tie to a buyer, she said, 'Look at the psycho bunny!'\" Godley says. \"The name stuck.\"  Since the initial launch of the Psycho Bunny neckwear collection, the brand has expanded into multiple categories including polo shirts, cashmere scarves & socks, and other men's apparel items. Godley became engaged to actress Jane Krakowski in December 2009 and their son Bennett Robert Godley was born in April 2011. The pair separated in December 2013. Godley now resides in New York City."

  "text" : "Raymond Benoist (10 June 1881, Vendresse – 17 January 1970) was a French botanist and entomologist. He is known for his research involving the plant family Acanthaceae. He studied botany in Paris, receiving his doctorate in 1912. Following graduation, he served as an assistant at the École pratique des Hautes Études. In 1913–14 he was sent by the government to French Guiana to conduct studies of its forests. He later made two scientific trips to Morocco — the first expedition being to the Middle Atlas and the High Moulouya for the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle (1918), and the second trip as an expedition leader for the Institut Scientifique Cherifien de Rabat (1928). In 1930–32 he taught classes in botany at the medical school in Quito. During his time spent in Ecuador, he conducted phytogeographical research as well as studies in regards to the morphology and biology of plants native to the Andes. From 1933 to 1942, he served as a deputy director at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle. Later on, he was named head of research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and in 1949-1952, was director of botanical services at the Institut de Recherche Scientifique de Madagascar (ORSTOM) in Tananarive. In 1908 he became a member of the Société botanique de France, being elected as its president in 1947. As a taxonomist, he described many species within the botanical family Acanthaceae. In the field of entomology, he published a number of works on Hymenoptera — along with Lucien Berland, he was co-author of the section on Hymenoptera in Rémy Perrier's \"La Faune de la France en tableaux synoptiques illustrés\" (Tome 7, Hyménoptères)."

  "text" : "Rudolf Hellgrewe (6 October 1860 – 1935) was a landscape painter and illustrator. He taught for a long time at the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Museum of Decorative Arts) in Berlin. He is the most famous painter of Germany's colonies. Hellgrewe was born in Hammerstein in the Province of Prussia. He attended the Königstädtische Realschule and later the Andreas Realschule in Berlin before studying under Eugen Bracht and Christian Wilberg at the Berliner Kunstakademie (Berlin Art Academy). He was drawn to landscape painting, and became known as the \"painter of Brandenburg's lakes and sunsets\" (Maler märkischer Seen und Sonnenuntergänge). In 1885–86 Hellgrewe travelled to East Africa, where he made numerous paintings. He later illustrated the books of the African explorers Carl Peters and Hermann von Wissmann, and produced dioramas of life in Germany's tropical colonies for use in schools. In 1888 at Berlin he published many of his works as a book, Aus Deutsch-Ostafrika. He took part in the colonial exhibitions of 1896 and 1907, and was one of the founding members of the Deutsches Kolonialmuseum (German Colonial Museum) in 1899. He also joined the Berliner Schriftsteller-Klub (Berlin Writers' Club). In 1903 the great Deutsche Kolonialhaus (German Colonial House) was constructed based on the native architecture of the colonies. Hellgrewe provided the ceiling paintings. Hellgrewe received Medal for Art and Science (Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft) from the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the Honorary Medal of the Geographical Society of Jena (Geographischen Gesellschaft zu Jena). He died at Berlin in 1935. By his wife, Anna Lagatz, whom he married 2 April 1887, he left three children: Joachim (born 30 December 1887), Anne Marie (born 23 February 1891) and Wolf Dietrich (born 20 July 1894). Joachim followed in his father's footsteps, becoming a landscape painter and art restorer. Joachim died 30 March 1956."

  "text" : "Ruth Sacks Caplin (September 5, 1920 – August 5, 2014) was an American screenwriter, arts advocate, and philanthropist known for her adapted screenplay for the film, Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont, starring Joan Plowright and Rupert Friend. Caplin began work on the screenplay for the film in the 1970s, based on a novel of the same name by the novelist Elizabeth Taylor. Her screenplay was ignored for decades until her son, Lee Caplin, acquired the rights to the film in 1999. Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont was finally released in 2005 when Caplin was 85 years old. Ruth Sacks was born in New York City on September 5, 1920. Her parents, who were Jewish immigrants originally from Eastern Europe, were both lawyers. Sacks received her bachelor's degree in art education in 1941 from Skidmore College. In 1942, she married Mortimer Caplin, an attorney, whom she had met when both were teenagers. The couple had five children, Lee, Michael, Jeremy, Cate and Mary Ellen Caplin. She now has nine grandchildren; Ella, Bennett, Sophie, Phoebe, Aubrey, Harriet, Daniel, Victoria ad Carter Caplin.  Mortimer Caplin served as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from 1961-63. Ruth worked as a fashion designer in New York City early in the marriage. The family moved to Charlottesville, Virginia in 1951 when Mortimer Caplin became a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. She began working on children's plays in local schools as a costume designer and director. However, many local public schools temporarily closed in the late 1950s as part of Virginia's resistance to desegregation at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. Caplin and other parents organized makeshift home schools for students in defiance of the closures. She taught her children dance, music and studio arts in the family basement. She also co-designed her husband's law firm office. The Caplins again relocated in 1961, this time to Washington D.C. when Mortimer Caplin was appointed Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the Kennedy administration. Ruth Sacks Caplin continued her work with children's theater in the Washington area. In 1977, she completed her master's degree in counseling and therapy from American University. She offered therapy and counseling services from her home in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Caplin did not retire from counseling until she was in her late 80s. Ruth Caplin Sacks chanced upon a novel called \"Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont\" by Elizabeth Taylor while traveling with her husband in London during the late 1970s. The Caplins had recently lost their daughter, 29-year-old Mary Ellen, to cancer. Ruth Caplin found the plot of the novel, which centers on Laura Palfrey, an older woman who moves to a residential hotel for the elderly, comforting. Palfrey, who is working through her own period of grief, befriends an aspiring young writer, Ludo. During the course of the book, Ludo helps Laura to overcome her loneliness and becomes as close as a grandson to her. Caplin, who identified closely with the story, soon set out to write a screenplay based on the novel. While she had been a writer throughout her life, she had never been published, nor had she previously attempted to pen a screenplay. Caplin purchased a how-to guide on screenwriting and began her work. Her writing for the film allowed her to retreat into an \"imaginary, quiet\" and move forward through her grief, according to the Washington Post. Caplin, who disliked unhappy endings, lightened the mood of some of the book's sadder scenes. Despite her efforts, Ruth Sacks Caplin's screenplay was ignored for decades until her son, film producer Lee Caplin, purchased the film rights for her screenplay and the movie in 1999. In the early 2000s, Lee and Mortimer Caplin flew Ruth to London, where she was surprised to find Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont in production. Directed by Dan Ireland, Academy Award-nominated actress Joan Plowright was cast Laura Palfrey, opposite actor Rupert Friend as Ludo in the title roles. Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont was released in 2005 when Ruth Sacks Caplin, making her screenwriting debut, was 85-years old. She acknowledged at the time that seeing her work in theaters was, \"...a nice surprise, in the senior quarter of my life to have this bloom.\" Film critics gave the movie positive reviews. Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post praised Joan Plowright's performance saying it was \"possibly her best role in the flickers\", while Roger Ebert called the film \"a delight ... in ways both expected and rare.\" Ruth and Mortimer Caplin donated four million dollars for the construction of a new theater at the University of Virginia. The Ruth Caplin Theatre, a 300 seat theater located in the Department of Drama, was named in her honor and her advocacy for the arts. The theater was opened and dedicated in 2013. Additionally, Ruth Sacks Kaplan helped to establish the university's President's Council for the Arts. A resident of Chevy Chase, Maryland, Ruth Sacks Caplin, who suffered from a heart condition, died at a hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, on August 5, 2014, aged 93. She was survived by her husband of 71 years and their four surviving children."

A student of Giulio Cesare Pupilli and Cesare Musatti, he was one of the foremost pioneers in the rebirth of Italian psychology after World War II, as well as the founder of the Bologna School of Gestalt Psychology and the guiding force behind it for 40 years. In 1957 he became professor of general psychology at the University of Salerno, then - from 1960 on - the first full professor of clinical psychology at the University of Bologna. One of his main interests was perception under the Gestalt theoretical point of view and its impact on mental health. Well ahead of his time, he spoke out on the need to include psychology in the medical school curriculum. Among Canestrari's students were several of Italy's most influential Gestalt psychologists of the following decades, e.g. Anna Arfelli Galli, Giuseppe Galli, Mario Fame, Paolo Bonaiuto, Alberto Ranzi, Pietro Tampieri, Giuliana Giovanelli, Giancarlo Trombini, Vincenzo Faenza, Augusto Palmonari and Gabriella Bartoli. These researchers, experts in a variety of fields of science and research, became known as the Bologna School of Gestalt Psychology. Since, 1979, Renzo Canestrari is a member of the Advisory Board of the international multidisciplinary journal Gestalt Theory. In 1991 he founded the Dipartimento della Formazione of the University of the Republic of San Marino."

  "text" : "Robert Braithwaite, CBE, DL (born May 1943), is a British entrepreneur, marine engineer and Founder and President of the luxury powerboat manufacturer, alongside John Macklin, Sunseeker. Born in Otley Moor, Yorkshire, Robert Braithwaite left school at 14 with no qualifications and moved to the Hampshire coast where his parents became proprietors of a village store near Christchurch. Following his dream to build boats he spent a few years servicing outboard engines and did an engineering course before completing a six-month apprenticeship at marine engine suppliers OMC in Belgium. Originally importers and distributors of boats from Scandinavia and the United States, Poole Powerboats as Sunseeker was formerly known created the foundations for its future luxury powerboats. Braithwaite and Macklin borrowed £5,000 to build their first boat – a 17 footer and then following collaboration with hull race-boat designer Don Shead, Sunseeker quickly expanded into the growing Mediterranean market. Braithwaite grew Sunseeker by continuing to expand its shipyards in Poole and create a widening global distributor network.In 2002 Braithwaite was awarded Ernst & Young UK Entrepreneur of the Year. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen’s Birthday Honors in 2007. After Sunseeker appeared in four consecutive James Bond films, Braithwaite was asked to appear in a cameo role in the film Quantum of Solace. The scene with Robert Braithwaite was filmed on location in Italy in April 2008, and features James Bond in a Sunseeker Sovereign 17, one of the company’s very first open cockpit speedboats. On 19 June 2013 it was announced that the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group had agreed to buy a 91.8% stake in Sunseeker for £320m. Robert Braithwaite continues as president whilst supporting and growing his personal charitable foundation The Autumn Trust."

  "text" : "Ronnie Fauss is an alternative country singer-songwriter based in Dallas, Texas. Fauss was born in Oklahoma and raised in Houston. He showed musical inclinations from an early age, writing songs and taking lessons in piano, guitar, and drums. Fauss recorded numerous demos with friends in Texas throughout the 2000s. The songs ranged from folk to rock to country to bluegrass, and were influenced equally by the alt-country movement of the 90s (Wilco, Old 97s, Son Volt, Whiskeytown, Slobberbone) and classic Texas troubadour singer-songwriters (Guy Clark, Steve Earle, Townes Van Zandt, Kris Kristofferson, Todd Snider). In early 2012, he released a collection of 11 of these recordings called “The Sun Is Shining Somewhere But Somewhere Isn't Here”. The album contains 9 originals and 2 covers (“Clay Pigeons” by Blaze Foley, and “Just The Other Side of Nowhere” by Kristofferson). Also in 2012 Fauss signed with New West Records. They released his full-length debut “I Am The Man You Know I’m Not” on their new imprint Normaltown Records on 10/9/12. The album reached #31 on the Americana music chart, #2 on the Texas Roots Country chart, and #6 on the European Americana chart. The New York Times said of the album “songs as memorable as the titles are clever”, and Vanity Fair Spain said of the album “the dream of every lover of Americana: a cross between Steve Earle and Gram Parsons”. The album received a good response from Texas publications such as Lone Star Music “merits a spot on any shortlist of rising troubadours worth paying serious attention to” and Texas Music Magazine called it “one of the best albums of the year”. In 2014 Fauss released his second album on New West / Normaltown records called Built To Break. Fauss cites the Old 97's and Slobberbone as key influences in his music and Rhett Miller shares lead vocals with Fauss on the album's signature track, \"18 Wheels.\" In an interview about the album, Fauss said, \"But on this one song, '18 Wheels' we just had the idea that this would be a cool opportunity because it tells a couple of stories and it’s a truck driving song. So it would be a good opportunity to get involved somebody else that has a recognizable voice and could come in and take some guest vocals. And I said there would be no one better for both symbolic reasons and a sound reasons than Rhett Miller.\" Ronnie's live band usually consist of 3 main stays including Shawn Hannon on guitar/harmonies, Rocky Garza on Bass, and Bob Koaba on Drums. Other musicians that have played live are Eric Neal on Peddle Steel, Fiddle, Guitar and Chris Norwood on Guitar, Mandolin, Lap Steel and Banjo."

Chris Simpson wrote in the preface, \"This book presents some of the best new research into the seamy side of the 'Reagan Revolution.' Russ Bellant's careful dissection of the American Security Council Foundation and of certain Republican Party organizations clearly establishes that neo-fascist thinking is flourishing among some of the right-wing activists who today today drape themselves in the American flag.\" The Harvard Educational Review calls Old Nazis, the New Right, and the Republican Party an important book \"which exposes the roots and growth of domestic fascist networks.\" In the same book Bellant documents Nazi involvement in the Ukraine; The Nation said \"Bellant's exposure of émigré Nazi leaders from Germany's World War II allies in the 1988 Bush presidential campaign was the driving force in the announced resignation of nine individuals, two of them from Ukraine\". Former Office of Special Investigations director Allan A. Ryan called it, \"Well-documented, and reliable\". Organizations dedicated to countering holocaust denial such as The Nizkor Project frequently cite Bellant's work. Bellant appeared as himself in the political documentary American Secrets"

  "text" : "Robert Kayser (born 15th. January 1805 in Naumburg; died 27th. October 1877 in Hamburg) was a Hamburg industrialist and banker. As a young man Kayser travelled to Chile in 1829 to seek his fortune where, after a while, he went into partnership with Max Theodor Hayn to found the firm Kayser, Hayn & Co. in Mazatlán. In 1839 he came back to Hamburg. In 1843 Kayser and Hayn, together with their friend Kunhardt, founded a firm in Valparaíso which foundered in 1849; in the same year Kayser, Hayn & Co. in Mazatlán was dissolved. In 1846 Kayser and his business partners founded the Firm Kunhardt, Kayser & Hayn in Hamburg, which was renamed Kayser & Hayn after Kunhardt's death in 1850. Hayn left the firm in 1854 and the firm was known as Robert Kayser until 1865. Kayser was among the founders in 1856 of the Norddeutsche Bank and was one of its leading lights, putting up founding capital of 500.000 Marks. He belonged to the board of Norddeutsche Bank from 1856 to 1877. From 1850 Kayser belonged to the Chamber of Commerce of which he was president in 1856. He was also a member of Hamburg City Hall from 1859 to 1868 and from 1871 to 1877. His daughter Cornelia was married to Rittmeister Vally von Blumenthal."

  "text" : "Royal Gay Nebeker (February 22, 1945 – September 6, 2014) was an American painter and print maker born in San Francisco. whose prints and paintings have been shown widely in Europe and North America including in Art Paris at the Louvre, Gallery Steen in Oslo and the Lisa Harris Gallery in Seattle. His formal education in art included a Masters Diploma from the National School of Arts & Crafts in Oslo, an M.F.A. from Brigham Young University, and a sabbatical with Japanese printmaker Yashi Ishibashi and papermaker Naoaki Sakamoto. Nebeker was friends with Gary Snyder and Robert Redford. His art has been collected by IBM, the National Gallery of Art in Krakow, Poland, the U.C.L.A. print collection and the Seattle Art Museum, among others. Nebeker's mother emigrated from Norway where Nebeker eventually traveled as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While there he studied at National School of Arts & Crafts in Oslo where he felt the influence of Edvard Munch. In 1972, Nebeker received a grant to live and work in Munch's Ekley Studio. Aside from multiple residencies and extended travel to Europe and Asia, from 1974 until his death in 2014, he lived in Astoria, Oregon, and painted in a studio on pilings over the Columbia River called The Uppertown Net Loft. He stated that Astoria reminded him of Norway. During The Great Coastal Gale of 2007, the upper floor of the studio was blown off and Nebeker lost two years worth of his paintings. He and a friend who broke his arm when the building lost its top were trapped there for twenty hours in the midst of 160 mile an hour winds. They finally escaped by lashing themselves to a ladder and crawling to safety. Nebeker's paintings include dream-like images often collaged with posters and handbills from his travels and quotes from Kierkegaard, songs, scripture and Ibsen, among others. His painting themes include pairings of a man and a woman, dream depictions, memories of childhood, bicycles and boats. Iconic figures like George Washington often appear. There is also frequent depiction of a woman called Blinky in a 19th-century polka dotted bathing dress. According to the art critic Richard V. West, she is both an avatar of Nebeker's wife Sarah and an appropriation of the work of Paul Gavarni. Nebeker kept a dream journal, a source for some of his work. There is a clear influence from expressionism, but Nebeker is less cynical and more humorous in the treatment of his subjects. In his self portraits, he sometimes portrayed himself as a woman. Asked why he often painted words and phrases in Japanese and Norwegian on his work, Nebeker responded, \"I don't like the way English looks, it is so blatant. It is too easy to take literally, too easy to see what it means. I don't intentionally obscure meaning, but I distrust clarity.\"  The last of his painted work often exceeded six foot dimensions. The painting \"When We Awaken\" 142x104 inches was initially smaller, but Nebeker felt the two figures rising from a tomb needed more sky above them and added a canvas on top which mostly holds more sky. Nebeker's smaller mixed media watercolors often depict flowers in vases. He was challenged to pursue this work by Horst Janssen when they met in the 1970s."

  "text" : "Robert Munford III (1737-1783) was an American playwright, civic leader and soldier, having served under Colonel George Washington in the French and Indian War and later serving in the Revolutionary War. Munford was the son of Robert Munford II and his wife Anna Beverley Munford. Munford hailed from Mecklenburg County, Virginia where he was an influential land owner and served on the first county government which formed there in 1765. He is best known, however, for his literary works as he is regarded to be the author of the first comedic plays written in America, The Candidates (ca. 1770) and The Patriots (ca. 1777). He also wrote a handful of poems, and left at his death an incomplete translation of the Metamorphoses of Ovid. No record survives of any public performance of either play, although it is possible that they may have been shown privately. Munford is currently buried near his homestead, most of which currently rests below John H. Kerr Reservoir near Boydton, Virginia. His gravestone can be viewed along the Robert Munford Hiking Trail, which is owned and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. One of Munford's poems was published in 1779, but much of his work remained unseen by the public before his death. In 1798 his son published a volume containing both plays, a handful of poems, and the first book of Metamorphoses."

  "text" : "Rani Karnaa was born in 1939, in a sindhi family of amirs in Hyderabad, in the present day Pakistan and erstwhile British India. Her father, Assandas Karnaa belonged originally to the Karnamalani family of Larkana region. The family name of Karnamalani, over a period of time, got abbreviated to Karanani and eventually to Karnaa. In 1942, her family moved to Delhi when the young Rani was three years old. She had her early schooling in Delhi and graduated in Botany from the Hindu College, Delhi. She also did Honours degree in Botany later but forsook academics to concentrate on her dance career. Rani Karnaa's family moved from Sindh to Delhi when she was three and settled at Connaught Place. She soon grew a fancy for dance seeing a neighbor dancing, insisted on learning the art and started learning dance from the age of four, learning Kathak, Odissi, Bharatanatyam and Manipuri. Her early teachers were Nrityacharya Narayan Prasad and Sundar Prasad. She continued her studies to master the Jaipur gharana style under Guru Hiralal and the Lucknow gharana ethos from Pandit Birju Maharaj. Rani Karnaa shifted her residence to Bhubaneshwar when got married into an Odia family in 1963 and this gave her an opportunity to meet Kumkum Mohanty, the famous odissi dancer. Through her, Rani Karnaa got in touch with the renowned guru, Kelucharan Mahapatra and learnt Odissi from the master from 1966 to 1985. She has also trained under various other famous gurus such as Amubi Singh, Narendra Kumar and Lalita Shastri, a disciple of the renowned Rukmini Devi Arundale. Rani Karnaa has performed extensively across India and outside, performing at almost all the major classical dance festivals in India. Her performances are said to have received acclaim in places like UK, Russia and many other European countries. Rani Karnaa lives in Kolkata, since shifting from Bhubaneshwar when her husband, Nayak, was transferred to Kolkata in 1978, attending to her duties as the director of Samskritiki Shreyaskar and is still active giving performances, her recent public performance being in 2013, at the age of 74."

  "text" : "Rachel Yehuda, PhD, (born 1959) Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, is the Director of the Traumatic Stress Studies Division at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. She was born August 1, 1959, in Israel to an observant Jewish family. Throughout her childhood she was immersed in Jewish culture and tradition, attending a Jewish day school and raised by her rabbi father. She grew up in Cleveland in a neighborhood populated by many Holocaust survivors- an experience that ultimately prompted her research on intergenerational trauma. She received her PhD in Psychology and Neurochemistry and her MS in Biological Psychology from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and completed her postdoctoral training in Biological Psychiatry in the Psychiatry Department at Yale Medical School. She has authored more than 250 published papers, chapters, and books in the field of traumatic stress and the neurobiology of PTSD. Her current interests include the study of risk and resilience factors, psychological and biological predictors of treatment response in PTSD, genetic and epigenetic studies of PTSD and the intergenerational transmission of trauma and PTSD. She has an active federally funded clinical and research program that welcomes local and international students and clinicians. Her research has focused on the children of Holocaust survivors and the children of pregnant women who survived the 9/11 attacks. She has been awarded the Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry (Munich, Germany) 2004 Guest Professorship. Her most cited article is a review of Post-traumatic stress disorder published in The New England Journal of Medicine, which has received 1060 citations according to Google Scholar."

  "text" : "Rachel George (born Rachel Parton; August 31, 1959 in Franklin, Tennessee) is an American retired singer and actress. She is the youngest of twelve children born to Lee and Avie Parton. Her celebrity siblings include entertainer Dolly Parton, as well as Randy and Stella Parton among others. As a child, she enjoyed wearing make-up and imitating her favorite stars. She later recalled, \"I was the only girl in the first grade that routinely powdered and rouged my face.\" Dennison also remembered, \"I never really wanted to be in show business. I just wanted to raise my kids and keep house, but I guess being in the business is just a 'family tradition'.\" She quit school after the eighth grade and toured the country with her family, often doing her elder sisters' make-up and occasionally singing backup. At age fifteen, she performed solo on stage for the first time. During her first performance, as she remembers, \"right off I saw this new piano man (pianist Richard Dennison) and knew he was the fella for me.\" She and Dennison were married three years later. In 1982, Dennison landed her first and only acting role in the ABC television sitcom incarnation of 9 to 5. Before the show premiered, she stated in a People magazine interview: \"I'm sure people will compare me to Dolly—it's only human nature.\" Her role, as bombshell secretary Doralee Rhodes, had been originated by her older sister, Dolly Parton, in the hit 1980 theatrical film of the same name. 9 to 5 was shot before a live studio audience and co-starred Rita Moreno and Valerie Curtin. The series had an impressive beginning in the ratings, but after a retooling (including the addition of Leah Ayres to the cast), the series was canceled by ABC after 33 episodes in 1983. The sitcom proved popular in reruns, leading producers to revive it in first-run syndication in 1986. Sally Struthers joined the cast, and the sitcom's popularity revived, producing another 52 episodes before ending in 1988. Dennison never acted again after 9 to 5 was canceled in 1988. During the network run of the series, she and her fellow cast members appeared on an episode of Battle of the Network Stars in 1983. She performed alongside her sister in a 1987 episode of her sister's variety series Dolly. Dennison's last appearance on camera was during an episode of Bravo Profiles titled \"Dolly Parton: Diamond in a Rhinestone World\" in 1999. Dennison has since retired from acting and singing."

  "text" : "Rania al-Baz (Arabic: رانيا الباز‎‎) is a Saudi Arabian television presenter, well known as the host of the programme \"The Kingdom this Morning\". She came to prominence after being badly beaten by her husband and hospitalized on April 13, 2004, when she was knocked unconscious and her face suffered 13 fractures. When photographs of her \"bruised and swollen face\" were published, they \"sent shockwaves through her country and around the world\", according to Guardian journalist Ed Vulliamy. In 2001 Al-Baz became the first female announcer on Saudi television despite opposition from religious conservatives over her uncovered face and colored (rather than black) hijab. Her career prospered until her beating in 2004. According to Al-Baz, her husband beat her after she answered the phone without his permission. He told her she was going to die, and after beating her and slamming her face repeatedly against the marble floor, put her body in the trunk of his car. When she woke up and started moaning, he dropped her off at a private hospital. According to Vulliamy, her story has \"fundamentally challenged the culture of silence\" in Saudi \"over violence against women\". Her husband was sentenced to six months in jail and 300 lashes, but was reduced by half \"after Baz publicly pardoned him and waived a compensation suit\". Her husband was ordered by a court to sue for divorce. Baz divorced her husband and won custody of her children. Arab News newspaper has called her \"a ground-breaker\", and her decision to go public telling what happened to her, \"a sensation in this private society\". Al Raz wrote a book about her ordeal, Disfigured: A Saudi Woman's Story of Triumph Over Violence. Following her beating and recovery, al-Baz worked on Al Arabiya and the Lebanese channel Future Television. She was criticized for appearing on foreign television programs without her headscarf and allegedly criticizing Saudi Arabia. On August 26, 2013 a law was enacted making domestic abuse a \"criminal offense punishable by a year in jail and a fine of up to USD $13,300\". According to Thomas Lippman, passage of the law was provoked by her beating and the photos of it that \"forced into the arena of public discussion a subject that had long been kept quiet\"."

  "text" : "Russell D. \"Russ\" Arnold (March 6, 1921 – January 27, 2012) was an American bridge player. He was world champion at the 1981 Bermuda Bowl and winner of nine North American titles. Born in Winnipeg, Canada, he graduated from the University of Minnesota. Long-time from Miami, Florida, he was an accountant and partner in running a successful major appliance business and so did not play bridge often, making his achievements all the more remarkable. Arnold was inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 2011 as recipient of the annual Von Zedtwitz Award, which recognizes players who have achieved prominence in the game and have an outstanding tournament record but who may not have been in the limelight for some years\"."

  "text" : "Ruth T. Sherman (1903 – April 6, 1965) was an American bridge player from New York City. In 1944 she became ACBL Life Master number 45, the sixth woman to achieve the rank. In American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) teams-of-four competition, Sherman won two of the three most important annual tournaments, the Chicago Board-a-Match (now Reisinger) in 1944 and the Vanderbilt in 1953. (The other is the Spingold; few women have won even two.) She also won the premier competition (then \"national championship\") for mixed pairs in 1942 and 1950, in partnerships with Harry Fishbein and Peter Leventritt; the premier event for women pairs in 1944 and 1949 with Margaret Wagar and Kay Rhodes. She won the analogous mixed teams three times, the women teams once. Ruth T. Sherman was a daughter of Judge Henry L. and Mrs. Edna L. Sherman. She received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Vassar College and worked several years in chemical research. She was a Ph.D. research chemist when she became a strong player in a recurring game including her brother John and based at the family apartment on Park Avenue. Sherman and her brother John won the Grand National Trophy in 1935 with a score of 67%. (Goren says the Mixed Team Championship, 1935.) She and Helen Sobel won the \"women's Eastern pair championship\" three years running, 1943 to 1945. In 1953 she and three other American women defeated the European Bridge League champion women in an unofficial match at the Regency Club in New York—Helen Sobel, Edith Kemp, and Margaret Wagar. Sherman died \"suddenly\" in her home at 14 East 75th Street in Manhattan, at age 61 on April 6, 1965. She was survived by two brothers and by their children. \"Miss Ruth T. Sherman\" bequeathed $60,000 to four nieces and two nephews. Her chief beneficiary was \"her old friend and partner, Adam Meredith, British bridge expert.\" (Meredith was one of the six-man Great Britain team that won the 1955 Bermuda Bowl in New York City, the first win for Europe against North America.) Sherman left him $450,000 in trust (now quoting the will) \"to enable him to continue his bridge activities\". The remainder would revert to her family upon his death. According to Alan Truscott, a British expatriate who had been New York Times bridge columnist for 15 months at the time of her death in April 1964, \"In recent years she became less active in American championships but played successfully in many European tournaments, often in partnership with former World Champion Adam Meredith.\" During the month before her death, Sherman and Sally Johnson led the field of women pairs at the ACBL Spring Nationals after three of four sessions but finished third. According to Charles Goren, Sherman had been exceptionally reliable: \"Her partners could rely upon her, but so could her opponents.\" She and the \"brilliant\" Meredith played mainly pairs in Europe, however, and she added deceptive tactics under his influence."

Andersen was born in Cedar Falls, Iowa, and studied at the University of Iowa before beginning a professional bridge career. Eventually he owned a seat on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and he died in a Chicago hospital at age 56. Andersen finally became a favorite commentator for European Bridge League and World Bridge Federation championships, as well as major ACBL tournaments. In the month before his death, June 1997, he worked the European Championships in Italy, from which he was flown home to Chicago after suffering two strokes in consequence of kidney failure. Andersen co-wrote seven books related to the Precision Club bidding system with C. C. Wei, inventor of the system, or Kathie Wei. Andersen and Sabine Zenkel traveled the world as a partnership during 1991–1992, based in Chicago. They also wrote a book, Preempts from A to Z (1993; 2nd, 1996)."
