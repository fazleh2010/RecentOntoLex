Her arrest along with three other well known artists' models for posing scantily clad as part of tableau vivant floats at the 1893 Bal des Quat'z'Arts in Paris' Latin Quarter, provoked one of the most famous student riots of the late nineteenth century. She modeled for Jules Lefebrve, Georges Rochegrosse, and Frederick MacMonnies among others."

  "text" : "Sidney Katz, MD (born 1924–May 4, 2012) was a pioneering American physician, scientist, educator, author, and public servant who developed the Index of Independence of Activities for Daily Living (ADLs) in a career spanning more than sixty years. He made several other advances in geriatric care, including the U.S. Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987, which established basic rights for nursing home residents. Katz received several public and private awards, including the Maxwell A. Pollak Award (1993) and the American Geriatrics Society’s (AGS) Foundation for Health in Aging (2001). The AGS award was also won by former US President Jimmy Carter and poet Maya Angelou. Katz held several academic positions, including Professor Emeritus of Geriatric Medicine at Columbia University, and distinguished scholar at the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging. He was a lifetime member of the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine (IoM), serving as the head of IoM’s Committee on Nursing Home Regulation from 1983 to 1985. During his time leading the committee, Katz initiated a review of current nursing home conditions; the committee developed a report that recommended an extensive redesign of nursing home policies, regulations, and standards. These recommendations were adopted into Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA-87), commonly known as the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987, which mandated standardized nursing home patient rights and enforced new regulatory requirements to ensure equal treatment of nursing home residents. Katz worked until the age of 87, retiring in 2011. He died at home on May 4, 2012 (4)."

  "text" : "Sterling Carl Campbell (1896/97 - September 6, 1990) was a Canadian aviator and film director best known for the 1947 film Bush Pilot, one of the first narrative feature films ever produced by a Canadian film production company. Campbell served in the Royal Canadian Army during World War I. He later worked in Hollywood, California as a technical and action assistant director, including the films Wings, Dawn Patrol, Hell's Angels, Air Circus, Legion of the Condemned, Forced Landing and Ceiling Zero, and as an assistant to Cecil B. DeMille and Howard Hawks. He also had minor acting roles in the films Forced Landing, Hands Across the Table, Professional Soldier and Love Is News. He subsequently returned to Canada, where he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. He married Margaret Campbell, later a Toronto City Councillor and Member of Provincial Parliament, in 1941. With Geoffrey Wood, Larry Cromien and Austin Willis, Campbell launched Dominion Productions in 1946. Bush Pilot was the company's first film. Due to poorer than expected revenues, however, the company never released another film under their management, and was subsequently acquired by Arthur Gotlieb. Campbell ran for a Toronto City Council seat in the 1956 municipal election, but fell while campaigning, exacerbating an old war injury and remaining bedridden for several months; despite having effectively dropped his campaign, he finished third behind the winners, William Dennison and May Birchard, and ahead of incumbent councillor Edgar Roxborough. In the subsequent 1958 municipal election, Margaret Campbell ran for council instead, winning the seat and beginning her own long career in politics. His son Sterling Campbell, Jr. was a city councillor and Member of Provincial Parliament in Sudbury in the 1970s and 1980s. He died on September 6, 1990 in Toronto."

Many of these objects were purchased by museums throughout the world. For example, in 2008 an 11th-century Chola-period bronze statue of a Dancing Shiva was sold by Kapoor to the National Gallery of Australia for $5.6 million (see Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol).

He was married to Eileen, daughter of Sir Owen MacCarthy Reagh the 12th Prince of Carbery, whose grandmother Eleanor was daughter of Gearóid Mór FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare. His eldest son, Connor (or Conor), was owner of Castlehaven. His daughter Eileen married to Richard Coppinger, a son of Sir Walter Coppinger with whom he had numerous disputes over land that continued up to O'Driscoll's death. Another son Fineen was born in 1585. His daughter Mary was captured by a pirate and slaver named Ali Krussa. He also had an illegitimate son, Gilly Duff (or Gilly Dubh, also known as Black Gilly Duff). Sir Fineen died in 1629 in his castle, An Clochán, on the island in Loch Ine. The O'Driscolls were a rich and powerful family and their territory stretched over much of south Cork, from Cape Clear and the nearby islands, through Baltimore to Castlehaven. Much of their wealth was attributed to \"black rent\", a due paid to them by fishermen for the use of their harbours and bays for fishing and salting herring."

  "text" : "Seamus Quaid (16 November 1937 – 13 October 1980) was an Irish police officer of the Garda Síochána (Garda 13497), killed in the line of duty by the IRA. He was a native of County Limerick, and became a member of the Wexford hurling team in October 1958. In 1960, Quaid was a part of the County Wexford team that won the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. In January 1972, IRA member Peter Rogers escaped from HMS Maidstone, a prison ship moored in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Fleeing south across the border into the Republic of Ireland, Rogers settled and married in County Wexford. Remaining an active IRA member, an incident occurred on 13 October 1980, where Rogers fired upon two policemen, Garda Quaid and Garda Lyttleton, while they were attempting to detain him. Lyttleton managed to escape but Quaid was wounded, and died within fifteen minutes. He was 42 years old. Rogers was sentenced to death, later commuted to forty years imprisonment, but was eventually released under the terms of the Belfast Agreement. Rogers claimed in 2014, that the 1980 incident which resulted in Garda Quaid's death had occurred shortly after attending a meeting in Dublin with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, to which Rogers was summoned because of his reluctance to move explosives to England for a bombing campaign. In 2014, Sinn Féin held their Ard Fheis (annual party conference) at the Wexford Opera House, which contained a plaque in memory of Garda Quaid. The Quaid family criticised Sinn Féin's decision to hold its conference in the opera house, believing the decision was a slap in the face of the family. The family then removed the plaque from the opera house before the conference, and declined to respond to apologies offered by McGuinness, or offers to meet him."

  "text" : "(For other people named Stephen Sutton, see Stephen Sutton (disambiguation).) Stephen Robert Sutton, MBE (16 December 1994 – 14 May 2014), was an English blogger and charity activist known for his blog Stephen's Story and his fundraising efforts for the Teenage Cancer Trust charity for the aid of teenagers with cancer. By the second anniversary of his death, £5.5 million had been raised in his memory. Born in Burntwood, Staffordshire, Sutton performed well at school, but withdrew his applications to university in 2012 after his terminal prognosis for colorectal cancer. His father had fought the disease twice, and both were predisposed to it through Lynch syndrome. Sutton had struggled to get a diagnosis as doctors did not believe that colorectal cancer could occur in a teenager. Sutton made a \"bucket list\" of things to do in his final months, successfully achieving many of them including becoming a Guinness World Records holder. He began fundraising for the Teenage Cancer Trust, receiving support from celebrities and politicians. In 2013, he met filmmaker Grigorij Richters, who recorded him for a documentary. Sutton died in hospital, at age 19. A memorial service to him at Lichfield Cathedral was attended by over 10,000 mourners. After his death, Sutton was posthumously recognised for his activism with awards including an MBE and an honorary doctorate from Coventry University."

  "text" : "Stefano Pittaluga (2 February 1887 – 26 April 1932) was an Italian film producer, one of several figures who helped revive Italian film production in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Originally a Genoa-based owner of cinemas, Pittaluga began to expand his business after 1924. He gained enormous power in the distribution sector by securing the rights to release the films of the Hollywood companies Warner Brothers, Universal Pictures and First National. Pittaluga also moved into the film production business around the same time, acquiring studios in Turin. Pittaluga was able to re-invest the profits he made from releasing foreign films into domestic production. He produced a series of films featuring pulp Strongman characters including Sansone and Saetta and particularly Maciste. The films led to him being the most commercially successful Italian producer of the era. Pittaluga's power grew in 1926 when he acquired the traditional leading production outfit Cines from the conglomerate Unione Cinematografica Italiana. Following on the heels of the development of sound film in America, Britain and Germany, Pittaluga had the Cines Studios in Rome fitted for sound production. Cines produced the first Italian sound film The Song of Love (1930), although another of the company's films Resurrection (1931) was actually made earlier but released later. Cines became the dominant force of the early sound era. Under Pittaluga the company specialised in releasing musicals and comedies. Much of the companies' output, often remakes of German or Hungarian films, were later branded \"White Telephone\" films. After Pittaluga's sudden death in 1932 the company continued to release the same kind of populist films, and were only overtaken when the Fascist government of Benito Mussolini invested large sums of money in production and constructed the vast Cinecittà complex in Rome."

Sennedjem is so far only known from his decorated tomb at Akhmim. The tomb is today heavily destroyed and much of the decoration is lost. The tomb was never finished and it is uncertain whether Sennedjem was ever buried here. In the tomb appears several times the name of king Tutankhamun, providing evidence that it was constructed under this king. In the tomb decoration also appears the overseer of nurses Senqed. The tomb was evidently built for two officials. It seems that the name of Sennedjem was deliberately erased from the tomb decoration. Evidently Sennedjem fell out of favour and his memory was deleted. It is uncertain whether that happened under Tutankhamun or later."

  "text" : "Sara Holmsten (1715-1795), was a Swedish memoirist and member of the Moravian Church. Sara Holmsten was the daughter of a farmer in Åland, and the devastation wrought by the Russian army during the Great Nordic War reduced her to beggary. She later supported herself as a domestic and factory worker in Stockholm, before she became a member of the Moravian church in Stockholm in the 1750s, where she worked for the leading members of the congregation. In accordance with the custom of the members of the Moravian Church at the time, she wrote her autobiography. Her autobiography from 1787 is regarded as being among the most historically interesting of contemporary Swedish works of that kind."

  "text" : "Saira Blair (born July 11, 1996) is an American student and politician from Martinsburg, West Virginia, notable as the youngest state or federal legislator in the United States as of 2015. In November 2014, aged 18, she was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates, representing the 59th district, which is based in the Eastern Panhandle and encompasses portions of Berkeley County and Morgan County. She is a member of the Republican Party. Blair, who is studying economics and Spanish at West Virginia University, defers her spring semester to attend the Legislature's 60-day spring session, making up her classes in the summer and fall. She has stated that she plans to become a financial advisor and will not continue a career in politics after graduating, serving at most eight years in the Legislature. She has said that she has \"no desire to climb the political ladder. Therefore, I don’t see myself serving in any federal positions.\" Blair's father is Craig Blair, a Republican member of the West Virginia Senate. He serves as her campaign manager. In the May 2014 Republican primary, at the age of 17, Blair defeated two-term incumbent 59th district delegate Larry Kump by 875 votes (54.55%) to 729 (45.45%). Kump, who had succeeded Blair's father Craig in the House of Delegates, said that he was not surprised he lost. He cited his independent voting record and the desire of the district's Republicans to be represented by a Delegate who would conform better to the party line. Her victory was notable in that, being only 17, she was too young to vote in an election that she won. In the November 2014 general election, Blair defeated the Democratic Party nominee, litigator Layne Diehl, also of Martinsburg, by 3,137 votes (62.69%) to 1,520 (30.38%), making her the youngest elected legislator in the United States. She was elected in the first election in which she was old enough to vote. Before running for office, Blair worked in her parents' apple orchard and for their water softening company. She donated $3,600 of her own money to her campaign, because \"I wanted to show people that I had skin in the game.\" Blair describes herself as \"very conservative\" and identifies as fiscally conservative, \"pro-marriage\" and \"pro-family\". She opposes the morning-after pill and opposes abortion under any circumstances, even in the cases of rape and incest. She supports voter ID laws, requiring welfare recipients to be drug tested, term limits and making West Virginia a \"right to work\" state. During the 2016 legislative session, while speaking about a bill she sponsored that would allow concealed carry of firearms without a permit, Blair said she had received \"multiple death threats\" during her first year as a legislator. She said that she didn't know if the threats were from liberals unhappy with her views or conservatives unhappy at being represented by a young woman. In January 2016, Blair was named the chair of the Legislature's Eastern Panhandle Caucus. She is running for re-election in 2016. She was unopposed in the Republican primary and will face Democratic nominee Catina \"Cat\" Webster in the general election."

Her acting skills and European features made her one of the most in-demand Turkish actresses in the early 1970s. With marked Circassian characteristics, Alkor was famous for her tall height, natural blonde hair, fair skin, and light green eyes. Due to her portrayal of Sümbül Karadağ on the primetime ATV series Asmalı Konak, she was nicknamed \"Hanım Ağa\", old Turkish for matriarch. Alkor served as presidents of various foundations, including TÜRKSAV and SODER."

  "text" : "Semonides of Amorgos (/sɪˈmɒnɪˌdiːz/; Greek: Σημωνίδης ὁ Ἀμοργῖνος, variantly Σιμωνίδης; fl. 7th century BC) was an Greek iambic and elegiac poet who is believed to have lived during the seventh century BC. Fragments of his poetry survive as quotations in other ancient authors, the most extensive and well known of which is a satiric account of different types of women which is often cited in discussions of misogyny in Archaic Greece. The poem takes the form of a catalogue, with each type of woman represented by an animal whose characteristics—in the poet's scheme—are also characteristic of a large body of the female population. Other fragments belong to the registers of gnomic poetry and wisdom literature in which the Hesiodic Works and Days and the Theognidea are classed, and reflect a similarly pessimistic view of the human experience. There is also evidence that Semonides composed the sort of personal invective found in the work of his near contemporary iambographer Archilochus and the later Hipponax, but no surviving fragment can be securely attributed to such a poem."

In addition to writing 18 books with Gregory White Smith, Naifeh is a businessman who founded several companies including Best Lawyers that spawned an industry of professional rankings. He is also an artist whose geometric abstractions, many large in scale, have been exhibited widely throughout the world over a period of 45 years. Jackson Pollock: An American Saga was published on December 24, 1989. The Philadelphia Enquirer called the book “Brilliant and definitive … so absorbing in its narrative drive and so exhaustively detailed that it makes everything that came before seem like trial balloons.\" Van Gogh: The Life, which Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times called “magisterial,” was published in 2011 with a companion website hosting over 6,000 pages of notes. The book stirred global controversy by debunking the widely accepted theory that Van Gogh committed suicide and arguing instead that village bullies shot him. “As a tale of ambition, hard-fought fleeting triumphs and dark despair,” said the San Francisco Gate, “it has the dramatic pull of a gripping nineteenth-century novel. … [The] biography enriches the eye. Its insight and vast information vault readers into the work of Van Gogh and the artists of his time. It deepens the experience of looking at art.\" “A tour de force,” said the Los Angeles Times, a “sweepingly authoritative, astonishingly textured book.\" His co-author, partner, and husband, Gregory White Smith, battled a rare brain tumor for four decades, dying in 2014 at the age of 62."

The nova was named Nova Geminorum 2. Also in 1912 he introduced a new class of variable stars, the RV Tauri variable stars.He spelled his family name Enebo during large parts of his scientific career, but in 1926 he changed it to Einbu according to the local pronunciation. Einbu attended Hamar offentlige lærerskole, and worked as a teacher in Øyer, Vågå and Sel before returning to his home community Dombås. He took an interest in astronomy at an early age, but could not devote himself fully to astronomy until he was appointed statsstipendiat (Government scholar) in 1908. He was a founding member of Norsk Novaselskap. He established and ran a magnetic monitoring station at Dombås from 1916. During his lifetime he was a people's educator and wrote frequently in newspapers and popular journals. His childhood house Einbustugu has been moved from Lesjaskog to Dombås, and is today a museum in his memory."

  "text" : "Susan Ware (born August 22, 1950), is an independent scholar, writer and editor who lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Hopkinton, New Hampshire. The author of eight biographies, two edited collections, and co-editor of a textbook, Ware is a specialist on twentieth century women's political and cultural history, and the history of popular feminism. Ware graduated from Wellesley College in 1972. She matriculated in the graduate program in history at Harvard University in the fall of 1972, completed her A.M in 1973, and earned a Ph.D. in history at Harvard in 1978. She served as a lecturer at Harvard from 1973-1978, and in the next eight years taught at Tufts University, the University of New Hampshire, and Harvard. In 1986, she was appointed as an assistant professor of history at New York University. Ware attained the rank of associate professor with tenure before she left in 1995 to pursue a full-time career in writing, editing and speaking. Since leaving NYU she has taught at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2014, upon the retirement of historian Nancy Cott, Ware was appointed as Senior Advisor to the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, while the Library searches for a new director. In her early work as a political historian, Ware established herself as an authority on women in the federal government during the New Deal. Her revised dissertation, Beyond Suffrage: Women and the New Deal (Harvard University Press, 1981) was the first historical monograph to show the pivotal role played by feminist progressive reformers like Frances Perkins and Molly Dewson in implementing social welfare at the federal level. As Nancy F. Cott wrote in a review of Ware's book, perhaps its most vital contribution to the field of women's history was its emphasis on \"historical generation\" and its recognition that political women \"relied on each other for mutual support, advice and patronage\"—much as political men did. Ware's research on women has been influential across fields. Political scientist Jo Freeman rated Ware's follow-up volume, Partner and I: Molly Dewson, Feminism, and New Deal Politics, as \"excellent\". Ware showed how Dewson not only brought hundreds of women into the federal government, but also revolutionized presidential campaign practices to such an extent that presidential advisor James Farley referred to her as \"the General\". Since becoming an independent scholar, Ware has published three books and edited four. In 2001, she became the general editor of Notable American Women, a multi-volume reference work that documents the history of women in the United States, Under Ware's direction, Harvard University Press published Volume 5 of this crucial biographical resource in 2004. Since 2012, Ware has been the general editor of American National Biography Online, published by Oxford University Press. Ware is married to Donald R. Ware, chair of the Intellectual Property Department at Foley, Hoag LLP in Boston."

  "text" : "Sir John Evelyn, 1st Baronet (12 March 1633 – 10 August 1671) was an English landowner in Surrey. Created a baronet at the English Restoration, he inherited the Godstone estate in 1664. He quarreled extensively with his family to obtain more money and impaired the estate with debts from a profligate lifestyle. The baronetcy became extinct upon his death and his entailed estates passed to his brother George. He was the second but first surviving son of Sir John Evelyn and his wife Thomasine Heynes. Evelyn married Mary Farmer, daughter of George Farmer, prothonotary of the Common Pleas, about 1653. As part of his marriage settlement, his father bestowed on him two manors in Godstone, Marden (now in Woldingham) and Flower, and the manor of Tillingdon in Tandridge. Evelyn was created a baronet on 29 May 1660 and was proposed as a Knight of the Royal Oak, with an income of £1,800 per year. His wife Mary died in 1663, without issue. Late in 1664, he married Anne Glynne (d. 1691), daughter of John Glynne, by whom he had one daughter, Frances (d. 1681). Sir John succeeded his father in 1664, inheriting an extensive estate in Godstone, including the manors of Walkhampstead or Godstone, Godstone Place, Lee Place, Marden, and Flower in Godstone. He was appointed High Sheriff of Surrey for the year 1666. Sir John was on bad terms with the rest of his family, filing a bill in the Court of Exchequer Chamber alleging that, being out of the country when his father died, his mother and brother George had taken the opportunity to withhold papers showing Sir John's right to certain of his father's lands. Lady Evelyn and George denied these charges, and added that Sir John had extorted certain lands from his father while the latter was alive, to avoid a lawsuit, taken a part of Lady Evelyn's jointure, and that Lady Evelyn had felt compelled to flee the family seat less than a month after her husband's death because of Sir John's temper. He was reported by John Aubrey to have demolished the manor house at Godstone because his brother would not grant him money \"to satisfy his vicious Inclinations\". Shortly before his death on 10 August 1671, Sir John conveyed Marden Park (including Tillingdon) and Flower to his mistress Mary Gittings. She in turn sold them to Robert Clayton and John Morris in 1672 (Marden) and 1677 (Flower). He was buried at Godstone. The baronetcy became extinct, and the entailed estates passed to his brother George; Sir John left £500 to his legitimate daughter Frances, whom he repudiated, and £500 per year to his natural daughter by Gittings, who shared her mother's name. George brought an action against her to prove her undue influence on Sir John's will, but was not successful in recovering Marden and Flower."

Also from Columbia, she later received a Masters of Library Science (1967) and an M.Phil (1975). She joined the staff of the New York Public Library in 1961. Upon the retirement of Sydney Beck in 1969, she succeeded him as the head of the Rare Books and Manuscripts of the Music Division. Her position included being the curator of the Toscanini Memorial Archives, a collection of microfilm copies of significant music manuscripts in other libraries. From 1987 to 1997 she was the head of the Circulating Collections of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. She was chief of the Music Division from 1997 to 2001, the latter two years concurrent with being the acting director of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts from 1999 to 2001. She retired in 2001. She joined the faculty of Columbia University's School of Library Service in 1969 where she taught music librarianship and performing arts bibliography until the school's demise in 1992, earning a highly regarded reputation. Beginning in 1960, Sommer contributed reviews to High Fidelity/Musical America. For a while she was editor of Current Musicology, and contributed to Musical Quarterly. From 1975 to 1981 she lectured on opera for the Metropolitan Opera Guild. Sommer maintained a close and active relationship with the Music Library Association. Her earliest reviews appeared in 1960. She functioned as the book review editor from 1978 to 1982, and as editor from 1982 to 1987. She served as president of the Music Library Association from 1989 to 1991. Despite being in ill health (only a month prior to her death), she attended the annual conference in Newport, Rhode Island to say goodbye to friends. She was also an active member of the International Association of Music Libraries, serving as editor of its journal, Fontes Artis Musicae from 1993 to 2000."

Susan came to Sydney around 1911 with two of their three living children, assuming the name \"Tarrant\" between 1915 and 1917. From the 1920s she worked as a midwife, although she never qualified with the Nurses' Registration Board and was the subject of two inquiries. She was also active in the Australian Labor Party, running for the state seat of Bondi in 1927. From 1928 to 1935 she was president then secretary of the Labor Women's Organising Committee; she was also a delegate to the Interstate Women's Conference in 1930 and president of the Blind Workers' Union in 1931. She ran for Waverley Municipal Council as a Lang Labor candidate in 1932, during which it emerged that she had been convicted in 1930 for witnessing false enrolment cards at the 1930 state election in Bondi. Francis was involved in efforts to establish the Hostel for Homeless Women and Girls as secretary of a Labor committee. Well respected in the labour movement, her second marriage on 18 April 1936 to John Laurence Wilkes was preceded by a large function in her honour organised by a Labor committee; Jack Lang paid tribute to her in the annual party conference. Following this marriage she became known as Nurse Francis-Wilkes. She remained active in the local Labor Party until her death from myocardial infarction and diabetes on 22 April 1946 in Sydney. She was buried with Catholic rites in Botany cemetery."

She is currently the Head of the Department for Languages and Communication at the International University of Management in the capital Windhoek. Schlettwein was born in Omaruru. Her publication Bullies, Beasts and Beauties, is a collection of short stories co-authored with Isabella Morris. She received a Highly Commended Award in the 2010 Commonwealth Short Story competition for her story “Framing the Nation” and was selected for the 2011 FEMRITE Residency for African Women Writers in Kampala, Uganda. In 2012 she attended the Kwani? Litfest within the framework of the Moving Africa Programme by the Goethe-Institut. Serubiri Moses highlights a kind of individual feminist tendency in her story \"Mother of the Beast\", from the anthology Summoning the Rains, when he says \"It is twisted in a way that puts self-individualism at the forefront without seeming too crude or too bitter. Everyone seems to try, but eventually give up. She in turn is left alone in that last scene with her jackal fur wrapped around her shoulders, failing to pull together her family life or her work life, left in a trance, bleak and abandoned.\""

  "text" : "Rabbi Avraham Shlomo Zalman Zoref also known as Ibrahim Salomon (1786-1851), born in Kėdainiai, was one of the first pioneers who rebuilt the Ashkenazi Jewish community in Jerusalem in the beginning of the 19th century. After making Aliyah and arriving to Ottoman Jerusalem, in 1824 the rabbi was sent to Constantinopole by the head of Perushim of Jerusalem, and succeeded in procuring a royal firman, commanding the kadi of Jerusalem to enforce the declaration of debt annualization concerning the Ashkenazi Jewish community of Jerusalem. With the annexation of Jerusalem by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1831, a window of opportunity arose for the Perushim. On 23 June 1836, after traveling to Egypt, rabbi Zoref, together with the backing of the Austrian and Russian consuls in Alexandria, obtained the long-awaited firman for the reconstruction of the Hurva Synagogue. Zoref became deeply engaged with Jewish lands seized by the creditors in Jerusalem and appeased the Arabs with annual bribes, but at some point the arrangement ceased and they tried to kill him. One night he was shot at by an unknown assailant who missed but later drowned after falling into a cistern. On a second occasion he was attacked on his way to prayers early one morning. In 1851, Zoref was struck on the head with a sword and died of his wounds three months later."

Bhattacharya is active in cross cultural musical collaborations. He has performed with Chilean/Sri Lankan Duo Alex & Nilusha in their award winning album Moments in Time and with cellist Emma Ayres. He also performed the first ever Australian concerto for Sarod with the Preston Symphony Orchestra in March 2014, conducted by Mario Dobernig. He also started the first series of Indian classical jugalbandis (duets) with the western alto saxophone player Nicolas Buff as part of the musical group Tihai3. Bhattacharya continues to promote Indian classical music and the sarod to wider Australian audiences through performances in regional cities and towns. He performed the first ever sarod concert in Darwin in May 2014. He wrote the book \"How to Play the Sarod\" considered the first ever method book written on this instrument in 2012. Bhattacharya graduated with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) New Delhi and completed his MBA from Deakin University in Australia"

A former member of the Birmingham Bean Club, he had been recommended in 1764 as a sound Tory, but fell in with the Rockingham Whigs and voted consistently with that faction. He was re-elected in 1774, but refused to stand again in 1780, when he was returned for the borough of Steyning in Sussex.

  "text" : "Sextus Miskow (3 February 1857 in Nyborg – 24 November 1928) was a Danish singer, composer and music critic. After 2 years in the army pupil school from 1871, Miskow changed tracks and continued his studies in violin and piano, and from 1876 to 1879 was taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Music. Here he concentrated on singing lessons with Carl Helsted as a teacher, and he made his debut as a bass singer at the Royal Theatre in 1880. He was never on the staff of the theater and worked since as a singing teacher and as a concert singer. At times he was also a music critic, including by Berlingske Tidende, Denmark's oldest newspaper, in the years 1903–1914, and choral conductor of the Copenhagen Workers' Choir, which he founded in 1915. Moreover, he began to compose. Most of his music is forgotten today, but one of his first songs was Den spillemand snapped' fiolen fra væg with text by Holger Drachmann, a song that still appears in new Danish songbooks and recorded by today's artists. To be known for one song is a fate he shares with many other composers (e.g. Alfred Tofft, Shaft Agerby and Jacob Saxtorph-Mikkelsen). For inscrutable reasons appear one Allegretto Fantasia for clarinet and piano by Miskow is a popular number on the Internet, where it can be heard in several versions."

  "text" : "(The native form of this personal name is Kim Sook-ja. This article uses the Western name order.) Sook-ja \"Sue\" Kim (born c. 1941) is a Korean-born U.S. singer. She started singing with her sisters in a group called The Kim Sisters at the age of 10 and played 13 different instruments. In 1950, the Korean War broke out and Sue Kim's father, Kim Hae-song, who was a famous Korean symphony orchestra conductor was captured by the North Korean army and later assassinated. Her mother, Lee Nan-young, was left with no home, no food and no money for her and her seven children. Lee was a famous Korean singer who rose to stardom with the song \"Mokpo Tears.\" In 1953, Lee asked the children to perform with her in South Korea's military clubs to support their family. The GIs donated rock and roll records for the sisters to memorize and sing, and in turn the sisters received chocolate bars and alcohol, which they exchanged for food. The GIs that returned to the States spread the word about the talented trio and in 1958, Tom Ball (who later became The Kim Sisters’ manager) heard about the sisters from one of the returning GIs and went to Korea to recruit them for an Asian act that he was producing. In 1959, Ed Sullivan was broadcasting his variety show live from the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. There he met the Kim Sisters and asked them to appear on his show and they were such a big hit that they invited their mother and the Kim Brothers to sing on his show in New York. Afterwards, Sullivan offered them an exclusive contract to make 22 appearances on his show. The Kim Sisters made their home in Las Vegas where they were accepted by the Las Vegas audience and all the local media, which led them to a 15-year engagement at the Stardust hotel, followed by 5 years at the L.V. Hilton Hotel and then 15 years at the Holiday Casino where they performed with their brothers. When the Kim Sisters were not performing in Las Vegas, they traveled all around the world and appeared on all the major television shows: The Dean Martin Show, The Dinah Shore Show, The Hollywood Palace, The Steve Allen Show, The Joey Bishop Show, and The Merv Griffin Show. While appearing in Las Vegas they co-starred with Maurice Chevalier, Louis Armstrong, George Burns, Jack Benny, Don Rickles, Helen Reddy, Phyllis Diller, Tony Martin, Phil Harris, Don Adams, Bob Newhart, Dick Shawn, Ames Brothers, Victor Borge, George Kirby, Jayne Mansfield, Diana Dors, and Martin Denny. Las Vegas was so good to them that they decided to become United States citizens. They appeared on many local charity shows such as the Jerry Lewis Telethon, the Shade tree Shelter Fundraiser, St. Viator Fundraiser, St. Jude, and many other charities around the United States and all over South Korea. Sue Kim was the president of the Korean American Women’s Association (a non-profit organization), and was given the Asian Community Achievement Award from the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce for her work. Sue Kim currently resides in Las Vegas with her Husband of 45 years, John Bonifazio, her son and his wife, Anthony and Marianne, and her daughter Marisa, along with her five grandchildren. Most recently, on March 27, 2014, Sue Kim became the first Korean American to be inducted into the Nevada Entertainer/Artist Hall of Fame."

  "text" : "Satyavati Devi (28 February 1905 – 26 October 2010) was an Indian freedom fighter and Gandhian. At the time of her death on 26 October 2010, she was India's oldest living freedom fighter. She did her schooling from Kanya Maha Vidyalay, Jalandhar. She married Lala Achint Ram in 1925. Her marriage was a dowry-less one and she wore no veil, which was the condition set by Achint Ram for marriage. She was popularly known as Bijji or Mataji. She was the mother of India's former Vice President, Krishan Kant. She also had two daughters Nirmala and Subhadra. On 26 August 1942 she was arrested along with her children for participation in the Indian freedom movement. Along with other women prisoners she hoisted the Indian tricolour in Lahore Jail where she was imprisoned by the Britishers. In prison she protested against the condition of barracks of political prisoners and went on a satyagraha. Post India's independence, she took an active part in Vinoba Bhave's bhoodan movement along with her husband Lala Achint Ram (who died in 1961) who was popularly called \"Gandhi of Punjab\". He had been member of Lok Sabha twice. They both urged the landowners to give their land to landless laborers. The revolutionary leader Chandrashekhar Azad stayed at her home for three days before his escape to Lahore. She had often fed the patriot Bhagat Singh with her own hands. Her daughter Subhadra, when arrested was only 13 years old and was the youngest freedom fighter to be arrested. In 1965, she donated all her jewels to the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund. She was always respected by everyone who came to her home. Her son Krishna Kant became the Governor of Andhra Pradesh in 1989 and continued there until 1997, when he was elevated to the post of Vice President. Krishna Kant took his mother to his home during both occasions. When her son died in 2002, she was sitting beside his body until it was taken for cremation. She outlived him for eight years, finally dying on 26 October 2010 aged 105, outliving many of her younger co-workers. She was cremated with all state honours at her native village on the next day. A year before death on 9 August 2009, she was honoured by then President Pratibha Patil as a part of the 67th anniversary of Quit India Day."

  "text" : "Sajjad Barzi (Persian: سجاد برزی‎‎; born March 5, 1981 in Tehran) is a retired amateur Iranian Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's super heavyweight category. Barzi has claimed three medals (one silver and two bronze) in the 120-kg division at the Asian Championships (2004, 2005, and 2006), and later finished fourth at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Throughout his sporting career, Barzi trained full time for Hafti Wrestling Club in Tehran, under his head coach Hassan Babak. Barzi qualified for the Iranian squad in the men's 120 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by placing first and receiving a berth from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. Emerging as a surprise medal contender in his category, Barzi quickly edged Hungary's Mihály Deák-Bárdos out of the ring in his opening match, and then grappled Finnish wrestler and four-time Olympian Juha Ahokas by a 2–1 sudden death decision in the round-robin pool to secure him a spot in the knockout rounds. He delivered a stunning maneuver to beat France's Yannick Szczepaniak 3–0 on his quarterfinal match, before being tamed by Russia's reigning world champion Khasan Baroyev in the semifinals. Facing off against U.S. wrestler and defending Olympic champion Rulon Gardner for the bronze medal, Barzi could not throw his formidable opponent off the mat and lost the match 3–0 in overtime. At the 2006 Asian Wrestling Championships in Almaty, Kazakhstan, Barzi captured the silver medal in his final showdown against the host country's Georgiy Tsurtsumia, producing his marvelous career record to three medals in total (two of which were bronze in 2004 and 2005)."

He went on to take the championship in the RX-7 class of the Fuji Freshman Race series and from 1994 moved up to the All Japan GT Championship. He is widely remembered for an incident that occurred at the start of the 1998 race at Fuji in which, following a serious accident that resulted in an outbreak of fire, he rushed over to the stricken car and frantically worked to extinguish the engulfing flames. Thanks to his heroic efforts the driver, Tetsuya Ota, was able to escape with his life. In recent years he served as the Clerk of the Course at various events such as Fuji Speedway races and the D1 Grand Prix. In 2011, he retired from Super GT300. On May 25, 2014 he checked into the hospital due to worsening conditions and he died the following day."

Before the latter's \"Examination of the Pharisaic Tradition\" had appeared in print, Silva, who had had an opportunity to read part of it in manuscript, issued a booklet in Portuguese against its author. This pamphlet, copies of which are now very rare, was written at the direction of the foremost members of the young community of Spanish-Portuguese Jews in Amsterdam. It is an able treatise on the subject discussed, and alludes to Da Costa only by his first name. Ten years previous to the publication of this pamphlet Samuel da Silva made a Spanish translation of Moses Maimonides' tract on repentance."

  "text" : "Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet (1581 – May 1642) was an English soldier, administrator and landowner who lived in Ireland. He was born into a Devonshire family, the son of Sir Nicholas Coote. In 1600 he moved to Ireland as a captain of the 100th Foot Regiment in the army of Lord Mountjoy, Lord Deputy of Ireland, where he fought in the last few years of the Nine Years War and was at the Siege of Kinsale in 1601–02 which ultimately led to the defeat of the O'Neills. In 1605 he was appointed Provost-Marshal of Connaught for life and in 1613 was appointed to the office of General Collector and Receiver of the King's Composition Money for Connaught, also for life. In 1620 he was promoted to vice-President of Connaught and made a baronet (of Castle Cuffe in Queen's County) the following year. He became a substantial landowner and served as a commissioner to examine and contest Irish land titles. In 1634 he was appointed Custos Rotulorum of Queen's County, again for life. He was elected Member of Parliament (M.P.) in the Parliament of Ireland for Queen's County in 1639. When the Irish Uprising of 1641 began, Coote was appointed Governor of Dublin and instructed to raise a regiment. He then marched south to secure Wicklow, marching north in 1642 to defeat the rebels at Swords and Kilsallaghan. In April 1642, he was ordered by James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde to relieve the beleaguered garrisons at Birr, Burris, and Knocknamease, after which he rejoined Ormonde's main force to defeat the Irish Confederates at the Battle of Kilrush in April, 1642. In early May of that year, he helped capture the garrisons of Philipstown and Trim, but was killed at Trim on 7 May 1642 during a Confederate counter-attack. He had married Dorothea, the daughter of Hugh Cuffe of Cuffe's Wood, and had 4 sons and a daughter. He was succeeded by his son Charles, who was made Earl of Mountrath. Another son Richard became Baron Coote of Coloony."

  "text" : "Shaun Phillip Williams (born December 5, 1976 in Pretoria) is a retired amateur South African freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's featherweight category. Williams has claimed three medals (two silver and one bronze) at the All-Africa Games, picked up a bronze in the 55-kg division at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, and later represented his nation South Africa, as a lone wrestler, at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Williams also trained for the University of Oregon's freestyle wrestling team, under his coach Pat Whidcomb, while studying and attending college in the United States. Williams emerged himself into the international spotlight at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, United Kingdom, where he took home the bronze medal in the men's featherweight division (55 kg). The following year, Williams continued to produce another sporting success by bringing home the African championship title in freestyle wrestling, and by ending up eleventh in the same class at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, which earned him a ticket to compete for the South African Olympic team. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Williams qualified as a lone wrestler for the South African squad in the men's featherweight class (55 kg), by receiving a berth and rounding out the top eleven spot from the World Championships. He lost his opening bout against Bulgaria's Radoslav Velikov because of the ten-point superiority limit, and could not gain enough points to outclass China's Li Zhengyu in a sudden-death match 4–5, leaving Williams on the bottom of the prelim pool and finishing seventeenth overall in the final standings. After his retirement from the sport in late 2007, Williams currently works as the wrestling head coach for Hermiston High School in Hermiston, Oregon."

  "text" : "Sasha Chanoff is an American aid organizer and humanitarian based in Somerville, Massachusetts who is notable for rescuing thousands of refugees in Africa. Chanoff founded a humanitarian assistance organization for refugees, called RefugePoint, which identifies endangered people, often children, generally in Africa, and provides assistance to them. Generally this involves coordinating their resettlement, by providing logistics including food and money, and working with immigration authorities in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and elsewhere. He enlists the help of the mass media to encourage donations as well as increase public awareness of the numerous problems facing refugees. For example, he was instrumental in getting RefugePoint featured prominently on the American TV news documentary program 60 Minutes in 2013. Chanoff believes resettlement is a vastly superior alternative to refugee camps, since re-settled refugees can support themselves and \"get on with their own lives\". He views his role as a humanitarian relief organizer to \"attempt to help everyone in need.\" His organization helps refugees in other ways, such as finding out whether the refugee's relatives are alive and where they are located, and passing along this information to the refugee. In 2014, he was instrumental in helping to rescue 3500 boys from Sudan and 89 girls, and he met with United States president Barack Obama with these rescued children. In 2006, he founded the organization called Mapendo, which was renamed RefugePoint in 2011, to aid at-risk and obscure African refugee groups. Mapendo helped to evacuate more than 10,000 refugees from Sudan, Kenya, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. He explained: Oftentimes, ethnic minorities, girls and widows are not safe in the refugee camps. Rape is fairly common, so a lot of women and their families flee the camps out of fear and end up homeless in urban centers with no access to services. Mapendo seeks to find these refugees and help them get the protection and services they need. The organization is named after Rose Mapendo, a Tutsi woman who spent 16 months in a Rwandan death camp with her husband and seven children, and whose experience we wanted to honor. Rose lost her husband in the camps but now lives in Arizona with her children. Mapendo is a Swahili word that means \"great love.\"— Chanoff, 2004, in interview on PBS"

  "text" : "Sultan Sri Alam, also known as Sultan Mughal (d. 1579) was the sixth sultan of Aceh in northern Sumatra. He led a very brief reign in the year 1579 before being deposed and killed. Sultan Mughal was one of the five sons of Sultan Alauddin al-Kahar. Before his accession he governed Priaman, a port town on the west coast of Sumatra. He was married to Raja Dewi, a daughter of Munawwar Syah of the Indrapura kingdom. When his elder brother Ali Ri'ayat Syah I died in 1579 he was briefly succeeded by his infant son Sultan Muda. The latter soon died, and the throne went to Sultan Mughal who took the reign name Sultan Sri Alam. According to the chronicle Hikayat Aceh he was excessively generous. Especially he gave away riches to the uleëbalangs (chiefs) of Barus, yet a port town on the west coast. Since the treasury was emptied, two grandees of the kingdom called Maharaja and Malik az-Zahir found him unsuited and deposed him after a very brief reign. The chronicle Bustanus Salatin relates that he was bad-tempered and unfit to rule, and was therefore deprived of his throne as well as his life. He was succeeded by his nephew Zainul Abidin. He was the progenitor of the later sultans of Indrapura. According to a much later genealogy he had a son Syekh Muhyuddin Fadlil Syah, whose great-granddaughter ruled Aceh as Kamalat Syah (1688-1699)."

  "text" : "Sir David Wedderburn, 1st Baronet (10 March 1775 – 7 April 1858) was a Scottish businessman and Tory politician. Wedderburn was the oldest surviving son of John Wedderburn (1729–1803, styled 6th Baronet) of Ballindean and his first wife Margaret Ogilvy, daughter of David Ogilvy (styled Lord Ogilvy). Both his father's and his mother's family had been attainted after the Jacobite rising of 1745, losing their titles, but his father continued to style himself as a baronet. His father had escape to Jamaica after the execution of his grandfather, and had established a successful business trading with his brother and cousins in their London trading house Wedderburn, Webster & Co. In 1796 David Wedderburn joined the business, at 35 Leadenhall Street in London, and make large profits. In 1803, he inherited his father's estates in Jamaica and at Ballindean, and was made a baronet,of Ballindean in Perthshire. He was elected at a by-election in 1805 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Perth Burghs. He had the support of the 9th Earl of Kellie, but was opposed by David Scott, son of the deceased MP David Scott. Scott had the support of the powerful Lord Melville, but by the time he began his canvassing Wedderburn was too far ahead to be dislodged. He was re-elected unopposed at the next three general elections. In the House of Commons he voted as a loyal Tory, though after 1812 he did not attend Parliament frequently. He is believed to have never spoken in the Commons. Wedderburn left Wedderburn, Webster & Co in 1816 and retired from Parliament at the 1818 general election. He sold Ballindean soon after, and served as Postmaster General for Scotland from 1823 to 1831. He married Margaret Brown; both their sons died before he did, so the title went to his half-brother, Sir John Wedderburn, son of Alice Dundas."

  "text" : "Sir James Johnstone, 4th Baronet (23 January 1726 – 3 September 1794)) was a Scottish officer in the British Army and then a politician. He sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain for all but one of the years 1784 to 1794. Sir James was the son of Sir James Johnstone, 3rd Baronet and his wife Barabara, daughter of Alexander Murray, 4th Lord Elibank. In about 1759 he married Louisa Maria Elizabeth Colclough, the widow of Rev. John Meyrick, vicar of Edwinstowe, East Retford, Nottinghamshire. They had no children. He joined the marines in 1748 as a Second Lieutenant, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1772. Johnstone fist tried to enter Parliament at the 1774 general election, when he began canvassing Dumfries Burghs, where the interest of the 3rd Duke of Queensberry was dominant. However, he made little progress and withdrew in favour of Alexander Fergusson of Craigdarroch, who was also unsuccessful. Queensberry's candidate William Douglas took the seat. Johnstone tried again at the 1784 general election. The 4th Duke of Queensberry lived in England and was unpopular in the area, and Johnstone won the seat in a 4-way contest, with the support of two of the five burghs. He took an independent line in Parliament, voting unpredictably. He supported Parliamentary reform and abolition of the slave trade, opposed the penal laws, and protested the tax burden on the poor. He supported the impeachment of Warren Hastings and of Elijah Impey, proclaiming in Impey's case that: \"We have beheaded a King, we have hanged a peer, we have shot an admiral, we are now trying a governor-general, and I can see no reason why we should not put on his trial a judge and a chief justice\". His independence was less appreciated in Scotland, where he denounced the Scottish legal system, and twice opposed reform of Scottish seats despite petitions in favour of reform from the Dumfries Burghs. At the 1790 general election, he faced a strong challenge from Queensberry's interest, who spent over £8,000, while Johnstone spent over £12,000 (equivalent to £1.29 million in 2017). Corruption was rampant, and despite out-spending his opponent, Johnstone won only 2 of the five burghs. However Johnstone's younger brother William had inherited a large fortune from his wife's family. He became one of the richest commoners in the empire and changed his name to William Pulteney. In 1790 he bought control of the four-seat borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, adding to his interest in other boroughs. To provide a seat for James, William asked Thomas Tyrwhitt Jones to vacate his seat at Weymouth, and at a by-election in 1791 James was returned in his place. He held the seat until his death, when William Pulteney succeeded to the baronetcy."

His mother was Sir William's second wife Margaret, daughter of Charles Murray of Hadden, Roxburghshire. The Eliotts of Stobs dominated the politics of Roxburghshire. Three generations of Sir Gilbert's ancestors had represented the county in the Parliament of Scotland, and at the first general election, 1708, to the new Parliament of Great Britain, Sir Gilbert was elected to serve in Westminster as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Roxburghshire. He stood down at the 1715 election in favour of William Douglas, son the county's hereditary sheriff. At the 1722 election he let the seat be taken by his relative Sir Gilbert Elliot, 2nd Baronet, of Minto. Minto was appointed in 1726 as a judge of the Court of Session, and at the resulting by-election Sir Gilbert was elected to replace him. However, at a dinner shortly after the election, he fell into an argument with Colonel John Stewart (a former MP for Kirkcudbright Stewartry).The dispute escalated into a fight, and Sir Gilbert killed the Colonel with his sword. He was declared an outlaw, and fled to Holland. He later received a royal pardon, and returned to Scotland."

He was the 4th son of Sir William Maxwell, 3rd Baronet, of Springkell in Dumfriesshire. His mother Margaret was the daughter of Sir Michael Stewart, 3rd Baronet, of Blackhall, Renfrewshire. He joined the army in 1788 as an Ensign in the 68th Foot, rising to brevet Lieutenant colonel in 1797, Colonel in 1805 and Lieutenant general in 1819. In 1802 he married Mary Heron, the only surviving child of Patrick Heron, a founder of the Ayr Bank and MP for Kirkcudbright Stewartry. When her father died in 1803, she inherited his estates, and John changed his name to Heron-Maxwell. His own father died the following year, and as the oldest surviving son Heron-Maxwell received a further inheritance and his father's baronetcy. He then sought the help of his friend Lord Dalkeith to find a seat in Parliament. Dalkeith's father the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch owned the Drumlanrig estate in Dumfriesshire and had a strong influence in Dumfries elections. However, Heron-Maxwell's chance did not some until the 1807 general election, when he was returned unopposed as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Dumfries Burghs. He is not known to have spoken or voted in the House of Commons, and stood down at the 1812 general election. Having gone on half pay from the army in 1802, he resumed full-time service in 1814."

He is famous for his coastal landscapes, near Naples and very rare landscapes of Calabria. His landscapes from 1875 to 1898 show the style of the School of Posillipo with influences of Edoardo Dalbono. After 1898 his painting style became more personal and distinctive, with a symbolist influence. He was popular with English and American visitors to Naples. His studio was visited by people including Empress Frederick, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Prince of Battenberg, Princess Louise, sister of King Edward of England. In 1889 he stayed with Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh at Malta for three months. He went on a painting trip to Spain visiting Granada, Seville, Cordoba and Zaragoza. He showed the works from this trip in an exhibition at Clarence House in London."

He achieved top six finishes in the 74-kg division at the Asian Games (1998 and 2002), produced a stark tally of four medals (one silver and three bronze) at the Asian Wrestling Championships, and also represented his nation India at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Before his sporting career ended in 2006, Maan trained full-time for Guru Hanuman Wrestling Club in his native New Delhi, under his coach and mentor Maha Singhrao. Maan made his senior sporting debut at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand, where he placed fourth in the men's welterweight class (69 kg), losing out to Japan's Ryusaburo Katsu by a tough 2–3 verdict. Determined to return to the sporting scene, Maan continued to blossom his wrestling career by collecting three bronze medals in the same class at the Asian Wrestling Championships since 1999, until he delivered his stellar performance with a silver in 2004. He also entered the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea as one of the heavy medal favorites in the middleweight category, but left empty-handed with a sixth-place finish. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Maan qualified for his first Indian squad in the men's 74 kg class. Earlier in the process, he clinched the eighth spot at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, and then confirmed his berth on the Indian team by placing third from the Asian Championships in Tehran, Iran. He lost two straight matches each to Japan's Kunihiko Obata (8–0) and Cuba's Iván Fundora (6–0) by an identical margin, leaving him on the bottom of the prelim pool and placing eighteenth in the final standings."

Siegel was the first mandolinist to record on Emile Berliner's phonograph disk-records. He was labeled \"America's Greatest Mandoline Virtuoso\" and \"The King of the Mandolin\" in the May 1900 Banjo World. Siegel performed both in Vaudville, as well as in concert halls. He had no formal training in music, but saw that the mandolin needed original music, rather than relying on the transcribed violin music. His compositions and arrangements were well known in his day. He was the author of Siegel's Special Mandolin Studies, published by Jos. W Stern and Company, 1901, in which he covered left hand Pizzicato and harmonic duo style."

Rinella qualified for the Italian squad in the men's 74 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, Rinella received a ticket to the Olympics by defeating Tajikistan's Yusup Abdusalomov for a third spot at the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria. He easily ousted Australia's Ali Abdo in his opening match on technical superiority, but fell behind Belarus' Murad Haidarau by a 2–4 deficit at the end of the prelim pool. Finishing second in the pool and seventh overall, Rinella's performance was not enough to advance him to the quarterfinals. In 2005, Rinella overcame his Olympic setback with a third career bronze medal in the same class at the Mediterranean Games in Almería, Spain. He also sought his bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, but failed to earn a spot from the Olympic Qualification Tournament, effectively ending his sporting career."

  "text" : "Samuel Sherwood was High Constable of the Toronto Police Department from 1852 to 1859. A tavern owner with ties to the Tory Family Compact, his brother, Henry Sherwood was Mayor of Toronto and then Premier of Canada West in the 1840s. According to Conyngham Crawford Taylor, Samuel Sherwood was “a quiet, good-natured man, who did not insist on any strict regulations as to the dress or discipline of the men. They wore a uniform, but without uniformity, except in one respect—they were universally slovenly.” His stewardship of the police force was accordingly lax. Most officers were Orangemen, at a time when Toronto was riven by religious sectarianism between the more affluent Protestant majority and the poorer Catholic minority, and showed favouritism to other members of the Orange Order, even to the point of joining them in brawling with Catholics in the six major instances of sectarian rioting between 1852 and 1858. In March 1858, Sherwood himself refused to testify against a fellow Orangeman implicated in rioting at the St Patrick's Day parade. Sherwood was appointed chief constable despite the fact that a provincial inquiry had implicated him in the 1841 election riot that followed his brother's electoral defeat that year. Sherwood had allegedly organized an armed gang inside the Coleraine Tavern which opened fire upon participants in the rival candidate's victory parade. In 1858, Sherwood let the prime suspect in the robbery of the Bank of Upper Canada go free prompting the mayor, William Henry Boulton, to order an inquiry. Sherwood quarreled with Boulton in the press, accusing him of running a star chamber proceeding against him, resulting in Boulton recommending Sherwood's suspension to city council. Council voted 14 to 10 in favour of Sherwood resulting in Boulton resigning as mayor, though he ran in the subsequent election. The scandal resulted in provincial legislation that required the appointment of an independent police board. The body, the Toronto Board of Police Commissioners was appointed in 1859 and fired Sherwood and the entire police force in order to replace them with a better trained, disciplined force. Sherwood went on to be Toronto's harbour master."

  "text" : "Simson Alexander David  (November 13, 1755 - Winter 1813) was a German art dealer, author, journalist, and member of the French secret police in the Napoleonic age, who was also known as Karl Julius Lange. Born as Simson Alexander David in Brunswick, Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel as the tenth and youngest son of the \"court jew\" Alexander David, he grew up in a family with a great fortune and much political influence. His father was one of the most respected advisers of duke Charles (Karl) I., who needed the wealth of his \"Kammeragent\" or chamber agent for his luxury expenditures. With the death of his father (1765), young Simson inherited at least 10 000 gold taler, worth a few million dollars compared to the purchasing power of the present. Due to the financial inability and extravagance of his young mother Deborah Siemons, Simson was in danger of becoming bankrupt, even before he started as an adult his own business as an arts dealer. Only the intervention of his guardian saved him from early ruin. Under the name Alexander Daveson, he started his business in the year 1778. Even while he had famous customers like the duke of Brunswick, the scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, his income seems to have been very modest. Plans to produce a collection of copies of ancient engraved gems never became reality. Shortly after he was involved in a scandal at the very popular lottery of nearby Kassel (April 1779). The authorities of Kassel suspected Simson of fraud by consistently filling out lots after the drawings. The successor of the late duke of Brunswick, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, sent him to jail. Despite a detailed investigation, there was no encriminating evidence against Simson. Maybe the new duke only wanted to take revenge against the man who had sold lots of luxury goods to the former duke. While in jail at Brunswick, the only man, who helped Simson was the famous author and librarian Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, who had great sympathies for outsiders of all kind. After his release Simson moved to Lessings home at Wolfenbüttel and stayed with him until the death of his benefactor (February 15, 1781). Lessing literally died \"in the arms\" of Simson, a fact, that was stubbornly disbeliefed by the local public, who felt annoyed by it. Even after his death, Lessing was regularly criticized by authorities and Christian contemporaries for his contacts with Jews and \"dubious people\". Many years later, Simson asserted, that he helped Lessing with a lot of money, for the librarian got only a very modest salary from the duke. Soon after Lessings death Simson travelled to England, where he stayed nine years. Since no detailed information or documents were found in the archives about these years of Simsons life, it is left to speculation, what kind of profession he had. Maybe he worked as a teacher, translator, travel companion or even Deklamator (recitator). He contended having been a student of the English language, trained by the prominent London publicist and philologist Samuel Johnson. Apparently Simson attended consistently British parliament sessions, being enthusiastic about the prominent orators, especially the liberal politician Charles James Fox, who openly sympathized with the American and later on with the French revolution. In October 1790 Simson came back to Germany, having become at that time a warm admirer of British culture and politics. He appeared at Hamburg first under the name Charles Lange, altering it shortly afterwards to Karl Julius Lange (apparently he was baptized). At the same time he adopted arbitrarily the title of a \"professor of eloquence and English language\". On the stage of the Hamburg theatre he tried to impress the audience with \"attic entertainment\", excerpts from Shakespeare plays and parliamentary debates. The spectators reacted with ridicule and laughter. Simson was mocked at for his small stature, his unmanageable hair, his bad teeth and his total inability to act. Nevertheless, Simson repeatedly tried to make a living as an actor. In Brunswick he was welcomed by the court and got a chance to perform with recitations in the local opera house, being applauded at least by the attending court members. After a short stay at Hanover and Vienna, where he published his first article about German language in the Wiener Zeitung, he went on a voyage to Switzerland. In 1794 he settled at Schweinfurt, Upper Franconia, where he married the sister of a Bayreuth official and wrote his first, two-volume book (Über die Schweiz und die Schweizer/On Switzerland and the Swiss). It was widely discussed in the German and Swiss press, because Karl Julius Lange criticized the political system of Swiss cities like Zurich and Basel as undemocratic and inhuman. For a few months Lange worked as a journalist for the Englische Blätter, a magazine about English politics, which was published at Erlangen. In 1796 he started his career as secret press agent of Karl-August von Hardenberg, the Prussian minister for the recently acquired Franconian principalities of Bayreuth and Ansbach. Hardenberg urgently needed a capable journalist for his propaganda against local and regional noblemen, who felt overruled by Prussia and who looked for some help in Vienna, where the Austrian Emperor took any chance to weaken Prussia. After several years as the much lauded editor-in-chief of the firmly democratic and liberal Deutsche Reichs- und Staatszeitung, Lange was sent to jail in May 1799 at Bayreuth for insulting the Emperor and the Austrian army. He had insinuated, that the Austrian authorities actively participated in the murder of three French diplomats at the Rastatt peace talks on April, 29 th., 1799. This allegation was never confirmed, but many eyewitnesses of the Rastatt events shared Simsons perception. Even while he had published his biweekly newspaper and all his personal articles with the secret assistance and subsidies of Hardenberg, the minister couldn´t help him no longer, for the Berlin authorities had no interest in provoking the Austrian government. Lange twice fled from jail and emigrated to Altona, then a Danish town next to Hamburg with a very liberal press law. The next years he published a lot of articles and books about his life at Bayreuth, his sentence and stubbornly tried to get a pardon from the Prussian king. Not before 1804, when political circumstances had changed a lot, he could return to Prussia and moved to Berlin, becoming a journalist and propagandist of Karl August von Hardenberg again. He released a few magazines, who all had a very limited life span, for Simson again and again had troubles with the censorship (Der Nordische Merkur, Der deutsche Herold). With the outbreak of the Prussian-French war in early autumn 1806, Lange started a new paper Der Telegraph, the first German newspaper, which was published daily, including Sundays and holidays. For he changed his political views after the great victory of Napoleon at Jena and Auerstedt in a very spectacular way and in the short period of only two weeks from a Prussian patriot to an admirer of Napoleon and the French army, Lange became the most hated man in Berlin. He was blamed being corrupt, opportunistic and an impertinent, for he criticized the old Prussian regime as outdated and swore at Queen Luise, the most admired woman of that time in Prussia. After the withdrawal of the French from Berlin in December 1808, Lange went with the French army to Stettin and Erfurt, but his Telegraph was never published again after December 3, notwithstand the personal will of Napoleon, who tried to revive the paper in January 1809. Lange worked as a consultant of the French army in the censorship of German newspapers. The Bamberg journalist Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, later-on a famous philosopher, and the author August von Kotzebue mocked Lange as a corrupt servant of the French. In the summer of 1811 Lange planned to write his memoirs in Frankfurt, but they were never published. According to newspaper articles of March 1813, Lange died at Minsk, presumably in the last months of 1812 or early 1813. There ist no information about his job or even how he came there. According to a note from the Bayreuth city archive, he was a \"civilian official\" with the French army, who invaded Russia in 1812. His wife Caroline lived in poverty in Bayreuth and died January 1848."

In Naples, he worked with Giuseppe Bonito, then moved away from the city to Apulia and Calabria. He did not make friends easily, and was said to flee to Dubrovnik and wander abroad, because of his \"bizarre and intolerant genius\". In Naples he painted allegorical subjects in praise of the Bourbons, and illustrated with drawings in book, then well known in Greece and Rome. After returning to Italy, he often to was seen mingling in the streets, in the taverns, and markets, searching for persons in dramatic situations. Thus he painted \"the bailiffs, martyrs, and confessors\"."

He is known for his narrative music video work for notable artists such as Basement Jaxx, Calvin Harris, Kygo, Placebo, !!! (chk chk chk), Vitalic, Apparat and Porter Robinson. In 2009, during his attendance as a film student at Art Center College of Design, Kesh came into light with his first music video for Cinnamon Chasers' first single: \"Luv Deluxe\". Luv Deluxe has received over seven million views to date, won SXSW Best Music Video award in 2010, and was shown in Saatchi & Saatchi's Director Showcase in 2010 at Cannes. In 2012, he went on to direct videos for Ed Sheeran, Deus and Calvin Harris, his video for the track 'Stamina' from French producer Vitalic sparked controversy with its thematic statements regarding weight loss and obesity in pop culture. The video resulted in Kesh winning his second SXSW 'Best Video\" award in 2013. In 2013, Kesh moved into the narrative world with his short sci-fi short film, Controller. The short received the No. 2 spot on Deadline Hollywood's 2013 ViewFinder's list, which polls Hollywood industry professionals on their favorite short films of the year. Later that year, he collaborated with celebrity author Bret Easton Ellis and the British alternative rock band Placebo on a short film series titled 'Unfortunate Details' which examined cases of sexual incidents gone awry. They were released as two music videos, for the band's album, Loud Like Love. In 2014 Kesh served as overseeing advisor to a team of directors for Visa's \"Samba of the World\", a digital campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Made in collaboration with AKQA and COPILOT Music and Sound, this interactive music video experience allowed fans to listen and watch 32 different music videos, based on 32 different countries, in real time. His video \"Never Say Never\", for Basement Jaxx details the development of a fictional product called TWERKBOT, a Twerking robot. The video features controversial themes on robotics, sexuality, and pop-culture. His most recent video for the 2015 YouTube Music Awards was for the artist Kygo, which featured an alien astronaut couple that crash-lands a costume party. Kesh is currently developing several films to direct including CUBED setup at Lionsgate Entertainment, which is loosely based on the 1997 cult film, Cube. On April 24, 2015, Deadline Hollywood announced that Kesh will be adapting and directing a feature-length version of Controller with 20th Century Fox."

  "text" : "Sven Gatz (born 6 May 1967 in Sint-Agatha-Berchem) is a Flemish Open Vld politician and the current Flemish Minister for Culture, Youth, Media and Brussels in the Bourgeois Government. From 1999 to 2011 he was member of the Flemish Parliament and from 2007 to 2011 he was leader of the Open Vld group there. He started as member of the Volksunie and switched to Open Vld when Volksunie was split. From 2000 to 2012 he was also member of the municipal council of Jette. In the 2012 local elections, he was not re-elected. In 2011, he left politics to become director of the Union of Belgian Brewers. In July 2014, he returned to politics when he became Flemish Minister for Culture, Youth, Media and Brussels in the Bourgeois Government as Open Vld had to provide the required minister living in Brussels. As Minister for Culture, his term of office has been marked by a decree that also makes libraries a municipal matter, no longer a Flemish one, and absolves the municipalities of their obligation to organise a local public library. This government decision was controversial and caused community leaders to speak out against it. In june 2016, Sven Gatz visited the brand new Lange Max Museum."

  "text" : "Shimon Tzabar (5 March 1926 in Tel Aviv – 19 March 2007 in London) was a member of the editorial board of Israel Imperial News. He described himself as a \"Hebrew-speaking Palestinian\". The son of poultry vendors, he was educated at a religious school. In his teens, after initially joining Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Betar organization, he became a member of all three Jewish underground military organizations in British Mandatory Palestine: Lehi (the \"Stern Gang\"), Etzel, and Haganah (Palmach) that fought the British and the Arab populations. He was arrested by the British Mandatory authorities and spend several months in detention at Latrun. With the establishment of Israel, he briefly joined the Israeli Communist party. He fought in the first three wars: 1948-50, 1956, and 1967. He strongly disagreed with the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem and takeover of the West Bank and Gaza Strip by Israel in the aftermath of the Six-Day war. After the Six Day War, he became famous for a declaration he published in Ha'aretz, together with 11 co-signatories, protesting the incipient occupation. In part it read:-\"Our right to defend ourselves from extermination does not give us the right to oppress others. Occupation entails foreign rule. Foreign rule entails resistance. Resistance entails repression. Repression entails terror and counter-terror. The victims of terror are mostly innocent people. Holding on to the occupied territories will turn us into a nation of murderers and murder victims. Let us get out of the occupied territories immediately.' He subsequently left Israel in protest, and took up residence in England. Tzabar was a columnist for a number of years for both the daily \"Haaretz\" and the weekly \"Ha'olam Haze\" newspapers. He also published 27 books in Hebrew, among these are works of fiction, travel, children's books and poetry. Allen Lane, the hard cover \"Penguin\", published his English book: \"The White Flag Principle\" that had been translated and published in Japan and in most European languages. His views eventually evolved towards anti-Zionism: Tzabar became an outspoken opponent of Zionism in addition to the occupation; he criticized peace groups like Peace Now and Gush Shalom. In 2004, Michelin threatened to sue him for trademark infringement, after he published a study of Israel's prisons under the title \"MUCH BETTER THAN THE OFFICIAL MICHELIN Guide to Israeli prisons, Jails, concentration camps and torture chambers\"; they eventually dropped the case, much to Tzabar's disappointment. An accomplished painter, polymath, and mycophile, he identified one species of mushroom."

  "text" : "Samuel Shaw was a Revolutionary War naval officer who, along with Richard Marven, were the first whistleblowers of the infant United States. As a whistleblower, Shaw was instrumental in the Continental Congress' passage of the first whistleblower protection law in the United States. Shaw, a midshipman, and Marven, a third lieutenant in the Continental Navy, were moved to act after witnessing the torture of British Prisoners of War by Commodore Esek Hopkins, then Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy. Shaw and Marven were both from Rhode Island, as was Hopkins, whose brother was Stephen Hopkins, Governor of the new state, and a signatory to the Declaration of Independence. For reporting the misconduct of the Navy's highest officer, Shaw and Marven were both dismissed from the Navy. Worse still, Hopkins then filed a criminal libel suit against Shaw and Marven in the Rhode Island Courts. Appalled by the case, the Continental Congress then enacted a whistleblower protection law on July 30, 1778, by unanimous consent. The law declared it \"the duty of all persons in the service of the United States, as well as all other inhabitants thereof, to give the earliest information to Congress or any other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds or misdemeanors committed by any officers or persons in the service of these states, which may come to their knowledge.” Congress then appropriated monies to represent and defend the Shaw and Marven against the libel suit filed against Hopkins, resolving that, \"reasonable expences [sic] of defending the said suit be defrayed by the United States,\" and Ordered terminated the employment of Hopkins, who \"had misconducted himself.\" On the second National Whistleblower Appreciation Day, Shaw was recognized as an unsung hero of American Whistblowers. On July 30, 2015, Shaw recognized at the First Congressional Celebration of National Whistleblower Appreciation Day, honored as one of two federal employees who created protections for those who stand for truth."

  "text" : "Sofia Poumpouridou (Greek: Σοφία Πουμπουρίδου; born June 12, 1980 in Lugovoye, Jambyl Region, Kazakh SSR) is a retired amateur Greek freestyle wrestler, who competed in the women's lightweight category. Considered one of Europe's top female freestyle wrestlers in her decade, Poumpouridou has yielded a remarkable tally of six career medals, including two golds from the 2001 Mediterranean Games and 2002 World Wrestling Championships. She also had an opportunity to represent the host nation Greece at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, finishing eleventh in the process. Throughout her sporting career, Poumpouridou trained full-time for Ephiridai Wrestling Club in Athens, under her personal coach Andreas Hristodoulakis. Poumpouridou reached sporting headlines at the 2001 Mediterranean Games in Tunis, Tunisia, where she picked up the gold medal in the women's 51 kg class. When Greece hosted the 2002 World Wrestling Championships in Chalcis, Poumpouridou enchanted the home crowd in a spectacular fashion, as she overwhelmed Japan's Chiharu Icho 3–0 and ran off the mat with another gold in the same division. When women's wrestling made its debut the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Poumpouridou qualified for the Greek squad in the inaugural 55 kg class. She filled up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling and the Hellenic Olympic Committee, as Greece received an automatic berth for being the host nation. Amassed the home crowd inside Ano Liossia Olympic Hall, Poumpouridou lost her opening match to France's Anna Gomis on technical superiority, and was wretchedly pinned by South Korea's Lee Na-lae that left her on the bottom of the prelim pool. Poumpouridou initially placed last out of twelve female wrestlers in the standings, but later upgraded to eleventh, as Puerto Rico's Mabel Fonseca was disqualified from the tournament after being tested positive for stanozolol. In 2005, Poumpouridou missed her title defense with a bronze in the women's lightweight category (55 kg) at the Mediterranean Games in Almería, Spain to cap off her sporting career."

  "text" : "Sara Anne Eriksson (born January 23, 1974 in Luleå) is a retired amateur Swedish freestyle wrestler, who competed in the women's middleweight category. Considered one of the world's top female wrestlers of her decade, Eriksson has yielded a remarkable tally of fourteen career medals, including two golds at the World Championships (1995 and 1996) and three more at the European Championships (1996, 2000, and 2002). She also had an opportunity to compete for Sweden at the 2004 Summer Olympics, finishing tenth in the 63-kg division. Before her sporting career ended shortly after the Games, Eriksson trained as a member of the wrestling team for Örgryte Sporting Club (Swedish: Örgryte Idrottsällskap) in Gothenburg, under her personal coach and husband Pierre Dikanda. Eriksson emerged herself into a sporting fame at the 1995 World Wrestling Championships in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where she captured the gold medal over neighboring Norway's Lene Aanes in the 57-kg division. By the following year, she campaigned her title defense in the same tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria, and then boasted for another gold at the European Championships in Oslo, Norway. Before her major Olympic debut, Eriksson held a stunning combined record of thirteen medals; three of which came from the World Championships, and the rest from the European Championships, including two more golds to her career hardware. At the 2002 World Wrestling Championships in Chalcis, Greece, Eriksson overcame her six-year struggle to reach the final match in the 63-kg division, but settled only for the silver medal after being pinned by Japan's Kaori Icho. When women's wrestling made its debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Eriksson qualified for the Swedish squad, as a 30-year-old veteran, in the 63 kg class. Earlier in the process, she earned an Olympic spot by taking second at the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tunis, Tunisia after missing out a coveted place from the World Championships. Eriksson lost her opening match 3–0 to Germany's Stéphanie Groß, and followed it with a 3–5 thrashing from Greece's Stavroula Zygouri in front of the home crowd, leaving her on the bottom of the pool and placing tenth in the final standings."

Aliev is also a member of the wrestling team for Trade Union Sports Club in Makhachkala, before competing for the Tajik squad in 2002. Aliev reached sporting headlines at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, where he picked up a bronze medal over neighboring Uzbekistan's Aslan Sanakoev in the men's light heavyweight category (84 kg) with a 3–1 decision. A year later, he captured a silver at the 2003 Asian Wrestling Championships in Delhi, India, losing 2–3 to Iran's Pejman Dorostkar. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Aliev qualified for his naturalized Tajik squad in the men's 84 kg class. Earlier in the process, he placed second and guaranteed a spot on the Tajik wrestling team from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria. Aliev started the four-man prelim pool with a pair of marvelous victories over four-time Olympic veteran Nicolae Ghiţă of Romania (3–4) and Senegal's Matar Sène (3–6), before being edged out by Russia's Sazhid Sazhidov in a more complacent 5–0 decision. Placing second in the pool and eighth overall, Aliev's performance was not enough to advance him to the quarterfinals."

She picked up a silver medal in the 63-kg division at the 2001 Mediterranean Games in Tunis, Tunisia, and later finished fourth in Athens, when Greece hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics. Before her sporting career ended in 2012, Zygouri trained as a member of the wrestling team for Atlas Kallitheas in her native Athens, under her personal coach and mentor Panagiotis Kalaigidis. Zygouri emerged herself into a sporting fame at the 2001 Mediterranean Games in Tunis, Tunisia, where she captured a silver medal in the 63-kg division, losing her final match to Italy's Diletta Giampiccolo. She also had an opportunity to compete for the Greek squad in the same category at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, but left empty-handed with a sixth-place effort. When women's wrestling made its debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Zygouri qualified for the Greek squad, as a 36-year-old, in the inaugural 63 kg class. Apart from placing sixth at the World Championships, she also managed to fill up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling and the Hellenic Olympic Committee, as Greece received an automatic berth for being the host nation. Amassed the home crowd inside Ano Liossia Olympic Hall, Zygouri started the prelim pool in a more sedate fashion with a pair of effortless victories over Germany's Stéphanie Groß 4–1 and Sweden's Sara Eriksson 5–3 to grant her a spot in the medal rounds. Zygouri was immediately pinned by U.S. wrestler Sara McMann in her semifinal match within 50 seconds, and then fell behind France's Lise Legrand with a similar disposition at two minutes and four seconds for the bronze medal, dropping her to fourth place. Currently, Zygouri works as a secretary for the association of the Greek athletes under the Hellenic Olympic Committee, and also, a member of the Department of International Women's Sports Wrestling Federation for FILA."

  "text" : "Sue Kunitomi Embrey (1923–2006) was a teacher, activist and long-time chair of the Manzanar Committee, which established the annual Manzanar pilgrimage and obtained National Historic Site status for the former concentration camp. Born Sueko Kunitomi, the sixth of her Japanese immigrant parents' eight children, Embrey was delivered by a mid-wife at the Kunitomi family's home in the Little Tokyo neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles. She attended the (largely Japanese American) Amelia Street School, and like many other Nisei she would go to Japanese language school each day after her regular classes. At fourteen, her father was killed in a truck accident. The family got by on the debts owed to Mr. Kunitomi, which Embrey's mother would collect from friends and neighbors, until Mrs. Kunitomi took out a loan and opened a small grocery store in 1941. Embrey graduated from Lincoln High School later that year and postponed going to college to help her mother with the family business. She was working at the store when news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor came over the radio on December 7, 1941. After President Franklin Roosevelt authorized the eviction of Japanese Americans from the West Coast with Executive Order 9066, Embrey's mother was forced to sell the family store at a loss, and one of her brothers moved to Manzanar early, responding to government calls for volunteers to help construct the camp. Embrey, then nineteen, arrived in Manzanar in early 1942 with her mother and six remaining siblings. She worked first at the camp's camouflage net factory, then took a job as a reporter with the Manzanar Free Press and ultimately became the newspaper's managing editor. In 1943, she was given clearance to leave camp and moved by herself to Madison, Wisconsin, where she took a job at a mail order company after being denied entrance to the University of Wisconsin, having been told that a Japanese American on campus would endanger a war-related project then taking place at the school. Embrey relocated again in 1944, joining her two older brothers in Chicago. Embrey returned to Los Angeles in 1948 to care for her mother, and briefly worked for the L.A. County Department of Education before transferring to the Health Department. She joined the Democratic Club and the Nisei Progressives, where she met Garland Embrey, whom she married in 1950. Her husband's political activities during the McCarthy era resulted in frequent encounters with the FBI, but he was able to secure a teaching position at West Los Angeles Community College, where he taught for twenty years. With the support of her husband, who took on joint responsibility for caring for the couple's two children, Embrey began attending California State University part-time and graduated with a bachelor's degree in English in 1969. She received her Master's in Education from the University of Southern California in 1972 and soon after began teaching for the Los Angeles Unified School District. She pushed for an inclusion of the history of the Japanese American incarceration in grade school and college classrooms, and became active in various labor organizations like the United Teachers of Los Angeles, the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, United Farm Workers, and UCLA's Labor Center. In 1969, Embrey attended the first Manzanar pilgrimage and spoke publicly about her wartime experiences. The following year, she co-founded the Manzanar Committee with Warren Furutani. Eventually she became chair of the Committee, organizing the annual pilgrimage for thirty-six years, leading the campaign to have Manzanar dedicated as a California historic landmark in 1972 and as a National Historic Site in 1992, and working with the National Park Service to develop the interpretive site. Embrey died May 15, 2006 of kidney failure at a Los Angeles Hospital. She was 83."

Dittmann's research focuses on the community of organisms living in soft sediments that make up the benthos. Using field experiments in tidal wetlands of temperate and tropical areas like the North Sea and Australia, she studies the roles of ecosystem engineers — such as mussel beds — and the impact on the ecosystem of human activities and invasive species. Dittmann and her team conduct regular monitoring of South Australia's Coorong, assessing the availability of food for migratory waders and how benthic invertebrates respond to changes in the environment."

He was a young innovative leader of a Korean religious foundation; he retired from the spiritual leadership in order to introduce a new way of art called Trans-Art. Sewon was well known in his youth as a prodigious painter until he discontinued his art and majored in Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University. However, the unexpected and sudden passing of his father, who was the founder of the Hanol religion (the religious re-establishment of the Korean national founding principle based on the philosophy of spiritual transcendence), eventually led him to return to art expressing ‘spiritual transcendence' based on his own experience. “Trans Art is ‘art’ that transcends the conventional form of art in order to express and experience the formless ‘essence of art’ which shares one and the same nature with our 'true essence beyond form’. In part 1, the artist attempts to express the ‘Enlightenment and Awakening’ which is beyond ‘Form’, by using the multi-dimensional expression method that he acquired from his own experience of the ‘Enlightening and Awakening’ process.” -An indirect experience of ‘Spiritual Transcendence’ by visualizing ‘Enlightenment and Awakening’ into Art - — Trans-Art official website, Introduction to Trans-Art"

  "text" : "Steven Joel Sotloff (Hebrew: סטיבן סוטלוף‎‎; May 11, 1983 – c. September 2, 2014) was an American-Israeli journalist. In August 2013, he was kidnapped in Aleppo, Syria, and held captive by militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/ISIS). On September 2, 2014, ISIL released a beheading video, showing one of its members beheading Sotloff. Following Sotloff's beheading, U.S. President Barack Obama stated that the United States will take action to \"degrade and destroy\" ISIS. President Obama also signed an Executive Order dated June 24, 2015, in the presence of the Sotloff family and other hostage families, overhauling how the U.S. handles U.S. hostages held abroad by groups such as ISIS. It was the capture and beheading of Steven Sotloff and James Foley that first made the general public aware of the ISIL group, when their beheadings were shown on international television. Sotloff's legacy is, in part, that he broke the Benghazi story to CNN that there was no protest, and that he foresaw the massive Syrian Refugee Crisis as he reported on the everyday people's suffering in Syria, thus earning him the reputation as \"The Voice for the Voiceless.\""

Oxley was a prolific contributor to the iStockphoto site, which he had joined because of a free promotional offer for purchasers of the Adobe Creative Suite. Both companies purchased Oxley's designs from the website (Twitter paid $10–15 for its logo, of which Oxley received $2–6) but the license did not allow them to use the works as logos. Twitter's founders redesigned their logo in response, but GitHub asked Oxley for permission, which he granted. He credits the Japanese popular art as an influence on his Twitter design and others, and said he was grateful for the wide distribution of his images despite receiving very little compensation."

With a budget of $1.8 million, the 4-hour-and-40-minute epic was devoted to the revolutionary Somali Dervish State. It was made in seven languages, namely Somali, Arabic, Italian, English, and three regional dialects. The movie included an actual descendant of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan as its star, and featured hundreds of actors and extras. Following the start of the civil war, Ahmed emigrated to Minnesota. He subsequently wrote the children's book The Lion's Share, which served as the basis for a Somali folklore-based play that he both penned and produced for the SteppingStone Theatre. Some of his poems have been translated into English by the Poetry Translation Centre."

  "text" : "Steven Omar \"Steve\" Hindi (born c. 1953/1954) is an American animal rights activist and businessman. He is the founder and president of the animal rights organization Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK). Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, Hindi grew up in a hunting and fishing culture. In 1985, he caught a 230-pound Mako shark in a feat that received a writeup in the New York Daily News. He ceased hunting and fishing after witnessing a live pigeon shoot in Pennsylvania on Labor Day, September 4, 1989. Shocked and disgusted by the sight of thousands of pigeons getting shot after flying from boxes, Hindi vowed to give up his hunting hobby and fight against it instead. Hindi founded the Fox Valley Animal Protectors, which evolved into the Chicago Animal Rights Coalition (CHARC) in 1993 and is currently called Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK), to document animal abuse and disseminate information. Hindi's animal rights activism with the organization has involved lobbying legislators to pass laws against animal cruelty and documenting and protesting against rodeos, live pigeon shoots, geese shoots, bullfighting, horse slaughter, and deer killing. He posts video footage of animal abuse on SHARK's YouTube channel. Hindi served a stint as shipping and receiving clerk at Carol Stream, Illinois-based Allied Rivet (then called Allied Tubular Rivet), a company that manufactures tubular rivets, before purchasing the company in the mid-1980s, becoming its president, and moving it to Geneva, Illinois. In 1992, he ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for a seat in the Illinois General Assembly against Tom Cross."

  "text" : "Long grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the only child of Zelda Klein Long (1948–2013) and Max \"Cary\" Long (1943–2003), who ran an antique store, Goudeau Antiques. He graduated in 1988 from Baton Rouge Magnet High School, and then attended Louisiana State University, earning a degree in Theatre in 1992. He did some part-time work building sets for local theaters such as Baton Rouge Opera, and then moved with some friends to Austin, Texas, where he continued at venues such as Live Oak Theatre. Because of the low pay in the theater business though, he began looking for other opportunities. On a whim, in September 1992 he responded to an ad looking for paid game testers, and to his surprise found himself suddenly hired by Richard Garriott's well-known game company Origin Systems (which shortly thereafter was acquired by Electronic Arts). At Origin, Long worked in Quality Assurance, documenting bugs on games such as Ultima VII, Wing Commander III, and ShadowCaster. He was soon promoted to QA Lead on games such as BioForge, then in 1995 to associate producer on Ultima IX, and to director of the first online version of the Ultima series, Ultima Online, where Long's online persona was known as Lord Blackthorn. The game was released in 1997, and though not the first graphical MMO, gained considerable attention as part of the popular Ultima series, attracting 250,000 players. It went on to win several awards, including being the first inductee to the GDC Online Awards Hall of Fame, and was listed by TIME magazine as one of the 100 greatest video games of all time. In 2000, Long and the Garriott brothers left Origin (which was disbanded by its parent company Electronic Arts in 2004), and formed a new company, Destination Games. In 2001 it was acquired by Korea-based NCsoft, with the company's first game Tabula Rasa released in late 2007. However, the game did not perform as well as was hoped, both Garriott and Long left the company in 2008, and the game was shut down in February 2009. The two then parted ways for a time, with Garriott forming a new company, Portalarium, and Long moving his family to Los Angeles, where he was hired by The Walt Disney Company as an executive producer. During the next four years, Long oversaw the creation of several social games and mobile apps for Disney and its subdivision Disney Interactive, such as the Disney Connected Learning Platform, the Disney Parent App for Facebook, several educational mini-games and a mobile version for Club Penguin, and several educational games for iPhones and iPads. Educators collaborating on the projects included Stanford University's Roy Pea and professors from the University of Georgia such as John Olive and Linda Labbo. Some games created were original concepts such as Pufflescape, Jelly Bean Counter, and Bits & Bolts, while others leveraged existing Disney properties, such as Cinderella Shapes & Patterns, Toy Story Letters & Letter Sounds, Fairies Art Studio, Ariel Numbers and Counting, Cars Numbers and Counting, and Disney Fairies Fashion Boutique. For a time, Long also managed the Disney online worlds Toontown Online, Pirates of the Caribbean Online, and Pixie Hollow, which were all closed in late 2013. In 2013 Long left Disney, formed his own consulting company \"Stellar Effect\", and then re-joined Richard Garriott at Portalarium. As of 2014, they are collaborating on a new game, Shroud of the Avatar, intended to be a crowd-funded and crowd-sourced title. Via Kickstarter in April 2013, Portalarium raised $2 million through crowdfunding, and Long was announced as executive producer in July 2013. The game's release is anticipated in 2015."

  "text" : "Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and reared in Redlands, California, little is known of Shadegg's early life, including his education. He worked extensively as a writer and published hundreds of stories in pulp magazines before his interest turned to politics. In 1932, he moved to Phoenix, where he authored radio scripts for such programs as \"Tales of Pioner Days\" and \"Phoenix Sun Ranch Chuck Wagon\". He spent much of 1939-1940 in Hollywood, where he wrote scripts for RKO Pictures. He was also a mail-order salesman, polygraph examiner, sheriff's deputy, an insurance agent, and owned a pharmaceutical company. His public relations firm had as its principal clients the Phelps Dodge Corporation and the Salt River Project. Shadegg was considered an authority on Arizona water issues. In the late 1940s, he developed a political and religious philosophy based on evangelical principles and opposition to liberal social policy, though he continued to worship as an Episcopalian. He was a vestryman in his Phoenix church and a figure in national Episcopalian affairs too."

In a 2012 review, Kate Kellaway of The Observer wrote: \"It is with disbelief that one discovers that The Last of the Haussmans is actor Stephen Beresford's first play. It is a knockout – entertaining, sad and outrageous. If he has more of this quality to write, he is going to be a major name.\" Beresford was born in London and raised in Dartmouth. He began acting with a local children's drama group when he was nine years old, and later attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. As an actor, Beresford's performances have included Where There's Smoke (2000) and That Thing You Drew (2010). Beresford has said that when working on screenplays, he always looks for projects with an \"element of subversion\" in them, so that he can find ways to smuggle in messages and meaning. He was a new entry in 2014 to the Independent on Sunday's Rainbow List at number 17."

  "text" : "Sears Gallagher (1869–1955) was a prolific, commercially successful American artist proficient in multiple media: drawing, etching, watercolor and oil painting. His work consists largely of landscapes, seascapes, and cityscapes depicting his native Boston and northern New England, especially Monhegan Island, Maine. Illustrating magazines and books provided steady work and income, and his etchings and prints attracted popular demand. Gallagher took his art seriously, adapted new techniques, and was open to the influence of European Impressionism. During the height of his career his watercolors were favorably compared to those of Winslow Homer (1836–1910) and F. W. Benson (1862–1910), and his etchings and drypoints to those of James McNeill Whistler (1834–1903)."

Mingo had been the third generation of her family to reside in the St. Bernard public housing development, the second largest housing project in the city. She was among many of those displaced after the storm. Mingo and her family were offered housing in the Columbia Parc Development which was being built on the same site, but refused. In early 2009 she published \"Comments On the Draft 'Policy Recommendations to Support Gulf Coast Housing Recovery'\" in collaboration with fellow activist Sam Jackson, criticizing a proposal for policy recommendations to the U.S. Congress over affordable housing in the Gulf Coast. The text and much of Mingo's activism focuses on the failures of a private sector driven approach to the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast. Stephanie was featured in the 2013 documentary Getting Back to Abnormal focusing on post-Katrina New Orleans, where she was depicted fighting alongside other activists against displacement in the Lower Ninth Ward."

He was born in Vermont and grew up in Maine. Morrill worked as a tanner in Kingston, Upper Canada and came to London in 1829, setting up a tannery there. His business grew to include a shoe and boot factory, but in 1868 he was forced to declare insolvency. Morrill was a trustee of the London Savings’ Bank, a trustee of the London Gas Company and a director of the London and Port Stanley Railway. He was also a founding member of the London Board of Trade. In 1841, he was named a justice of the peace. In 1844, Morrill was an unsuccessful candidate in a by-election for the London seat in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, losing to Lawrence Lawrason. He represented St Andrew's ward on London town council for a number of years and was the town's first mayor. Morrill was also active in the local temperance society. He was married twice: first to Margaret Andrews and later to Eleanor Beach. He died in London at the age of 77."

During the War of 1812 he fought in the Battle of New Orleans under General Andrew Jackson. Through his father's connections Stephen became a cashier at the First Bank of the United States where he soon resigned and went to work at Stephen Girard's bank. Soon after he worked as a writer for a local newspaper where he wrote a series of editorials publicly attacking the First Bank of the United States. He later co-founded the Columbian Observer where he continued his public attacks on this bank. Simpson later preferred writing over political pursuits and is also noted for his other works which include a dual biography of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and another biography critical of prominent Philadelphia banker Girard. Simpson's social and political philosophy embraced both conservative and radical ideals."

Her collections of stories are renowned for examining the entirety of the Palestinian identity during this time period. Her first set of short stories, Small Things, was published in 1954, and examined women's role in Palestinian society. After returning to Beirut in 1959, she examined other Palestinian social structures such as the class hierarchy. She published two more collections of short stories during her life, The Big Shadow and The Clock and the Man. Throughout her writing, she does not cast blame as to the cause of these social structures, but rather creates plot lines that characterize these different sub-cultures within Palestinian society, relating them to political situation of this historical period. Therefore, her writing creates a very holistic view of Palestinian national identity during this time in history."

  "text" : "Sotherton Nathaniel Micklethwait (22 August 1823 – 25 March 1889) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who appeared in one first-class cricket match for Cambridge University in 1843. He was born at Taverham Hall, Norwich, Norfolk and died at Hickling, also in Norfolk. Micklethwait was educated at Shrewsbury School and at Magdalene College, Cambridge. His single cricket appearance at Cambridge University came in the 1843 University Match against Oxford University, and he batted at No 11 and appears not to have bowled: he scored 11 and 1 not out in a low-scoring game. There is no record that he played any further matches, even minor games. His brother Frederick Micklethwait played for Cambridge University in the 1836 University Match and also appeared in first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club. Micklethwait graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1846. He was ordained as a Church of England clergyman and from 1849 to his death in 1889 he was vicar of Hickling in Norfolk. The benefice of Hickling was in the gift of the Micklethwait family and he was presented at his induction by his father, Nathaniel Micklethwait."

He collaborated with Alexander Bogdanov in producing the 10th revised edition of Kratkii kurs ekonomicheskoi nauki (1920) which appeared in an English translation by Joe Fineberg as A Short Course in Economic Science (1923). However Bogdanov was to criticise Dvolajckij's view that the method of K. Marx’s Das Kapital was not applicable to the analysis of non-capitalist social-economic formations. In 1928 his Ćastnyj kapital v torgovle SSSR was published in Russia. In 1934 his translation of a chapter of Rosa Luxemburg's The Accumulation of Capital was published in Moscow: Tugan-Baranovsky He was director of the Department of Culture and Propaganda of the Azov-Black Sea Territorial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) from 1936–7 when he was purged."

  "text" : "Steven \"Handsome Stevie\" Mazzone (born 1964) is an American mobster believed to be the acting/street boss of the Philadelphia Crime Family. Mazzone's rise in power through the Philadelphia underworld began as a protege of former boss turned informant, Ralph Natale. After the family was decimated by prosecutions during the Nicodemo Scarfo and John Stanfa eras, Natale was released from prison in 1994 and shortly thereafter became the new boss of the crime family. Natale partnered with the \"Young Turks\" faction that was one of the few remnants left of the Stanfa organization, and their leader, Joseph \"Skinny Joey\" Merlino. After Natale assumed the top position as boss, he positioned Merlino as underboss and Ronald Turchi as the consigliere in the new hierarchy. This administration is still in question to this day, as many now believe that Merlino was the real boss all along, while Natale was merely a figurehead. Riding the power of Natale and his own friendship with Merlino as well, Mazzone was inducted into the family himself and became a caporegime in 1996. Following Natale's 1998 arrest for drug trafficking, Merlino would officially take over the family and become the new boss. With Natale feeling slighted, and now realizing he may have been a puppet for Merlino all along, he decided to cooperate with the government in 1999 and agreed to testify against his former friends. With Natale gone, and Merlino now in charge, Mazzone was promoted to underboss in 1999. However, Mazzone's reign on the street wouldn't last long. Mazzone would be indicted in June 1999 along with Merlino, George Borgesi, John Ciancaglini, and several other high-ranking members of the Philadelphia crime family for racketeering and murder. Mazzone and all of his co-defendants were acquitted of the murder charges; however, he would be convicted of racketeering in 2001 and sentenced to nine years in federal prison. Including Merlino, who was sentenced to 14 years, the upper echelon of the family was once again decimated. Following the indictment and imprisonment of the hierarchy and top soldiers, Merlino would remain in control from prison, while installing Joseph \"Uncle Joe\" Ligambi as the acting boss of the family. After serving nearly the whole length of his nine-year prison term, Mazzone was released on February 2, 2008, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website. Following his release, Mazzone was to have no contact with other convicted criminals or known mobsters, and he was placed on federally supervised release for three years. Coincidentally, in the months following the expiration date of his parole restrictions, Joseph Ligambi, the acting boss of the family, was arrested himself in May 2011 following a sweeping racketeering indictment that threatened to eradicate the hierarchy of the family once again. Just prior to the indictment, Joseph Merlino was released from federal prison and into a halfway house in Florida. Merlino would also have to serve three years of supervised release until September 2014. Upon being released from the halfway house, Merlino publicly moved to Boca Raton, Florida and renounced the mob life, saying he was retired and there were \"too many rats\" around organized crime. With Ligambi denied bail and forced into waiting out his trial in the federal detention center in Philadelphia, Mazzone was elevated to acting boss, a position he still holds today. After two federal trials in which the government failed to convict him, Ligambi was released in February 2014 and claimed to friends and family that he was ready to retire from the mob life. His retirement remains in question, and many believe that Ligambi is partially retired and serving as the consigliere of the family. Local law enforcement, prosecutors, and the FBI all speculate that Merlino still remains the official boss while ruling from afar, relying on Mazzone to run the family in South Philadelphia. Merlino was ordered back to federal prison in January 2015 to serve a four-month sentence stemming from a parole violation in which he was convicted of meeting with fellow South Philly mobster John \"Johnny Chang\" Ciancaglini. According to recent reports, with Merlino now in prison, a three-man ruling panel consisting of Mazzone, Ciancaglini, and former Scarfo era soldier Phil Narducci has been established to take care of the day to day street operations of the family."

Singh killed one of them while they were just a few metres away from the Line of Control. At this, the terrorists dispersed into the jungles and Singh led a search for them. In the process, he sustained gunshot wounds and succumbed to the injuries. He crawled forward to a boulder from where gunshots were fired at the soldiers. He shot dead one more terrorist that pounced upon him. The terrorist hid in a house nearby, but Singh climbed on the roof of the house and blew it up with grenades. During the firing that followed, the terrorist hurled a grenade at Singh from which he suffered splinter injuries. Unmindful of his injuries, Singh killed two more terrorists. Later while being evacuated from the place, Singh succumbed to his injuries. His team killed two more terrorists and eliminated the threat. For his bravery, Singh was posthumously awarded the Ashoka Chakra, the highest peace time military decoration in India."
