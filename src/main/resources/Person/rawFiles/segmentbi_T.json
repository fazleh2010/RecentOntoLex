He was born in Kristiania as a son of Fredrik Lange-Nielsen (1891–1980) and Laura Stang Lund (1893–1961). He was a maternal grandson of Fredrik Stang Lund. In 1953 he married Sissel Herlofson. He finished his secondary education in 1940 and graduated with the cand.jur. degree in 1947. He was hired in the Office of the Attorney General of Norway in 1951, and worked here until 1972, only interrupted by a few years in his own law firm. From 1956 he was a barrister, with access to working with Supreme Court cases. From 1972 to 1991 he was a presiding judge in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. Despite passing the normal retirement age, he was then an extraordinary judge in Oslo City Court from 1991 to 1995. His special fields included insurance law—he chaired Norsk forsikringsjuridisk avdeling from 1971 to 1982—and tort law, in which he lectured at the University of Oslo. He did however become better known for unveiling and overturning miscarriage of justice cases, an endeavor to which he dedicated his later life. Lange-Nielsen also chaired the Norwegian Association of Lawyers from 1971 to 1975. He resided in Skarpsno. He died in April 2014 in Oslo, following three weeks of illness."

  "text" : "Takayoshi Kano (加納 隆至 Kanō Takayoshi) is a Japanese primatologist, known for his pioneering work on the bonobo chimpanzee (Pan paniscus). He highlighted their peaceful communal lifestyle, and the high frequency of sexual interactions. A student of Junichiro Itani, he was a professor at Ryukyu University and at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University. In 1973, he founded the first bonobo study center, at Wamba, Luo Reserve. It is the oldest bonobo research area and has survived a number of political upheavals in the region. Initially in his career, he assisted Toshisada Nishida in his work on the chimpanzees of the Mahale mountains in Tanzania. In 1971, Nishida conducted a brief survey looking for the bonobo (or the \"pygmy chimpanzee\"), and encountered several abandoned chimpanzee nests. In the conclusion of his report, he suggests that Before we can begin to make an intensive study, we must first make an extensive preliminary survey covering the vast area of the Central Congo Basin. In 1973, Takayoshi Kano conducted this survey, covering a large area of severalhundred kilometers on bicycle, when he visited a number of remote villages unaccustomed to non-Africans, some which were hostile. He eventually came upon the village of Wamba, where the villagers were more welcoming, and he could hear bonobo calls from the forest. Unlike the area near Lake Tumba visited by Nishida, there was no tradition of hunting chimpanzees for bushmeat here. It took over an year of effort by Kano and his assistant, Suehisa Kuroda, before they could habituate the first group of bonobos in the area, provisioning them via a sugarcane patch. The chimpanzees in the area have little fear of humans, because of a local legend, that the humans and bonobos were cousins. According to this belief, an older brother in a family of bonobos held to their traditional lifestyle and his descendants thus remained in the forest as bonobos. However, his younger brother was tired of eating raw foods. Once upon a time, he was roaming in the forest, crying, a spirit of the forest taught him to make fire, after which he left the forest and began eating cooked food. His descendants became humans. Therefore, the village people consider the bonobos akin to distant brothers and do not kill or eat them. In the local language Bongando, one of the words for the bonobo is elia, or \"missed\" - the bonobos are thought to have \"missed\" becominghuman, or have been \"blocked\" on this path. Kano was among the first to comment extensively on the sexual practices among the Bonobo, particularly the use of sex as a mechanism for reducing tensions within the group. Kano's work motivated a large group of researchers to work at Wamba, many of them from Kyoto and other institutions in Japan. He was among the movers for the founding of the Luo Scientific Reserve in 1990. The group was forced to pause its work several times - during the anti-Mobutu outbreak in 1991-92, and a major disruption after the Tutsi rebellion and war from 1996 to 2002. Kano's main work, The Last Ape: Pygmy Chimpanzee Behavior and Ecology, was translated from Japanese into English in 1992."

The Dabhade clan had carried out several raids in the rich province of Gujarat, collecting chauth and sardeshmukhi taxes. After the death of his father Khande Rao in 1729, Trimbak Rao became the senapati. When the Maratha king Chhattrapati Shahu's Peshwa (prime minister) Bajirao I decided to take over the tax collection in Gujarat, the Dabhades rebelled against the king. Trimbak Rao was assisted by Nizam of Hyderabad and other Maratha clans that had traditionally controlled Gujarat (Gaekwad and Kadam Bande). On 1 April 1731, he was defeated and killed by Bajirao in the Battle of Dabhoi. Even after killing him, Shahu and Bajirao avoided a rivalry with the powerful Dabhade clan: Trimbak's brother Yashwant Rao was made the new senapati of Shahu. The Dabhade family was allowed to continue collecting chauth from Gujarat on the condition that they would deposit half the collections in the Chhattrapati Shahu's treasury."

  "text" : "Artist and community activist Tomie Arai was born in New York City in 1949. A third generation Japanese American, her parents are from Hawaii and California and her grandparents were farmers who settled in the country in the early 1900s. Her experiences growing up Asian American in New York City deeply color her work as an artist, as many of her works deal with the urban experience and attempt to make connections to her family and community through art. At the time she began to pursue a career in art in the late 1960s and early 1970s, her feeling that the New York art world failed to address her experiences as an Asian American and woman of color propelled her to become involved in community art. She joined the Basement Workshop in 1972 and there, learned about Asian American activism and making art along with other Asian American artists, including Arlan Huang. Between 1972 and 1979, Arai worked at Cityarts Workshop as a resource center coordinator and mural director, painting a series of community murals in New York City’s Lower East Side. Cityarts’ first project in Chinatown, A History of Chinese Immigration to the U.S., involved many Basement Workshop members. After Cityarts, Arai worked as a freelance graphic artist for Alan Okada of Citibank. At the time, Arai created posters, brochures and promotional materials for community groups as part of Citibank’s Graphic Support program. In the 1980s, Arai began to focus on printmaking. As a Board Member of the Lower East Side Printshop and a keyholder for over 15 years, Arai also participated in print residencies at the Women’s Studio Workshop, the Printmaking Workshop, Self Help Graphics and the Brandywine Workshop in Philadelphia. These non-profit workspaces encouraged artists to collaborate and experiment with the printed image."

However, one year later, Tarkhun was overthrown by a local rebellion because of his pro-Muslim policy, and was succeeded by another Sogdian prince named Gurak, who had Tarkhun imprisoned. Tarkhun shortly committed suicide. His two sons, however, managed to flee to the court of another Sogdian ruler named Divashtich at Panjikant, where they were treated honorably."

He acted as consul to Kings George II and George III in Danzig during the Seven Years' War and until his death in 1780. As consul he was responsible for sending information to the Secretary of State in London. Many of the reports were concerning the complex political and military developments happening in and around Poland in general and at the port of Danzig in particular. Among many other things he reported on the trade in timber intended for the building of warships and on the crippling taxation being imposed on the city of Danzig. Corry was given the title \"Baron to the Throne of Poland\" on 20 October 1773 by the King of Poland, Stanisław II Augustus. On 29 March 1776, he was knighted by King George III. His death triggered a long, drawn-out dispute regarding his estate and wealth."

  "text" : "Thomas Bache (died 1410) was an Anglo-Italian cleric and judge who held high office in Ireland in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries: he served one term as Lord High Treasurer of Ireland and three terms as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. The Bache family came originally from Genoa. They had a long-standing connection with the English Court: over several decades two \"merchants of Genoa\", who were both named Anthony Bache, and were presumably father and son, supplied the Royal Household with spices and other luxuries, and also loaned the English Crown substantial sums of money. Thomas was almost certainly a member of this family although his exact relationship with the two Anthonys is unclear. Thomas entered the Church and served as a Crown official in England in an unspecified capacity, before coming to Ireland in the late 1360s. He did not reach the upper ranks of the Church, but was appointed first Archdeacon of Dublin, then Archdeacon of Meath; he was also given the livings of Kilberry, County Meath, and Brington, Northamptonshire. He achieved high office in the political and judicial spheres, being appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland in 1376, and Lord Treasurer 1400–1402. He was appointed a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1380, and became Chief Baron the following year. He was twice superseded, but then reappointed, as Chief Baron, before retiring for good in 1405. He also served as Deputy to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1398. He is thought to have died in 1410."

As a youth he stayed with relatives in Ottoman-ruled Macedonia and visited the Ottoman capital at Constantinople, acquiring a knowledge of their history and culture. In later life he served successive Popes as a counsellor and repeatedly advocated the dispatch of a new Crusade against the Ottomans. His chief legacy is his Italian-language history on the origins of the Ottoman state and its history up to that time, whose first version was published in 1509 in Italian and was soon translated into French. Spandounes continued working on it, with the final version appearing in 1538. The work is disorganized and contains errors, but is extremely valuable as a historical source for its wealth of information."

He hails from the Boto people. He did his university studies at the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Varanasi and the Punjabi University in Patiala. Samphel was one of the key leaders of the Lamdon Social Welfare Society, a social reform group set up in 1969 by Ladakhi youth that had studied in Srinagar. The Lamdon Society sought to challenge the then dominant politicians in Ladakh. Between 1971 and 1987 he served as president and secretary of the Lamdon Model Schools. In 1987 Samphel was elected to the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly, standing as the Indian National Congress candidate in the Leh seat. He obtained 16,142 votes (56.39% of the votes in the constituency). Following his tenure as Member of the Legislative Assembly, he served as Leh District Congress Committee president between 1990 and 1996. He served as the president of the Ladakh Buddhist Association between 1997 and 2004. Between 1987 and 2004 he also served as Executive Director of the Leh Nutrition Project. As LBA president he was a key actor in setting up the Ladakh Union Territory Front. Moreover, he is the founding secretary of the Ladakh Co-operative Transport Society. In December 2005 he reconstituted the Ladakh unit of the Indian National Congress, thereby challenging the position of the LUTF to be able to represent all Ladakhi Buddhists. This move caused a split in the LBA. He became the president of the Ladakh District Congress Committee. As of 2012 Samphel was a member of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. On 20 March 2014 the Congress Party declared Samphel is its candidate for the Ladakh Lok Sabha seat in the parliamentary election. He filed his nomination papers on 15 April 2014. Although he was expected to win, traditional Congress supporters were divided, and two independent candidates affiliated with Muslim organizations that previously supported Congress filed in the same constituency. Samphel lost by 36 votes, the closest margin in the 2014 election, to Thupstan Chhewang of the Bharatiya Janata Party."

Thomas is first heard of in 1465 when he was having great difficulty collecting a debt: according to Elrington Ball he had to make forty journeys between Dublin and County Meath in pursuit of it. He became Attorney General for Ireland in 1478 and at the same time was made Master of the Royal Mint in Ireland. As Master of the Mint he was soon drawn into a major political controversy when Lord Portlester, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, refused to hand over the Great Seal of Ireland to Lord Grey, the Lord Deputy of Ireland: this was part of a comprehensive challenge by the Anglo-Irish nobility to Grey's authority. King Edward IV tried to resolve the problem by ordering Archbold to issue a new Great Seal, and declared that the Seal held by Portlester was declared to be \"damned, annulled and suspended\", while all his acts as Lord Chancellor were \"utterly repudiated\". Portlester and his allies, undeterred, continued their defiance of Lord Grey, and Grey, despairing of ever being able to establish his authority, left Ireland within the year. Soon afterwards Archbold was appointed a Baron of the Court of Exchequer for life, but he was later superseded. He acted as Deputy Master of the Rolls in Ireland in 1479. Like most of the Anglo-Irish nobility he supported the claim of the pretender Lambert Simnel to the English Crown in 1487; Simnel's attempt to seize the throne ended with a crushing defeat at the Battle of Stoke Field. The victorious King, Henry VII, was merciful to the Irish rebels, as he was to Simnel himself and nearly all of them received a royal pardon the following year, including Archbold, who was reappointed to the Court of Exchequer at the same time."

Following completion of her PhD in 1935 she worked for a time as a botany instructor but saw little opportunity to progress. Subsequently she worked with the US Government, first with the National Bureau of Standards and then at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) until she left in 1951. Her work focussed on plant microchemistry and the physiology and microscopic analysis of commercial furs. She assisted with Second World War efforts when she was requested to apply her studies of fur fibres for the armed forces. She wrote several books including Microscopic Methods Used in Identifying Commercial Fibres published in 1939. A cash award is made available at the University of Missouri by an endowment established by Thora Hardy in memory of her husband, John I. Hardy. The award is bestowed on an undergraduate to recognize their academic achievements, the quality of their independent research projects, and their extracurricular contributions."

  "text" : "Teofila \"Totti\" Cohen AM OBE, née Kaplun (5 March 1932 – 29 August 2010) was an Australian educational reformer and solicitor who served as president of the Federation of Parents and Citizens Associations of New South Wales from 1973 to 1980. She was born in Paddington to Polish-Jewish emigrants Stanley Kaplun and Adel, née Gutman. She attended local primary schools and then Parramatta and Sydney Girls' high schools. She topped the state in history in the Leaving Certificate, also winning first-class honours in English and Latin; consequently she won a scholarship to the University of Sydney, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Law in 1956. In that year she married Neville Albert Cohen; they would adopt one son in 1960 before Cohen gave birth to another in 1961. She was the first woman employed as a solicitor at Minter Simpson, before moving to F. W. Jenkins and Co. which she eventually bought after Jenkins's death. She explored the option of teaching when her sons began attending school and enrolled externally at the University of New England, but discovered that teaching positions were only readily available north of Tamworth and gave up the idea. She joined the Parents and Citizens (P&C) Association at Coogee and by 1968 rose to the state council. She ran as a candidate for the Defence of Government Schools group in the 1969 federal election, challenging the Speaker of the House, Sir William Aston, for his seat of Phillip; she received 2.3% of the vote. In 1973 she was elected president of the Federation of P&C Associations, and significantly increased the influence and political involvement of the organisation. Awarded an OBE in 1978, she was a parent representative on the Education Commission and vice-president of the Australian Council of School Organisations. She retired in 1980. Following her retirement from the P&C presidency, Cohen served part-time on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Consumer, Trading and Tenancy Tribunal, and was chairwoman of the New South Wales Privacy Committee from 1983 to 1993. Awarded the AM in 1987, she was also involved in the National Council of Jewish Women and the Jewish Board of Deputies. She died in 2010."

  "text" : "Thomas Lee French (10 June 1821 – 7 April 1909) was an English landowner and clergyman who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and Cambridge Town and minor cricket for amateur teams in East Anglia. He was born at Eye, Suffolk and died at Menton in the south of France. As a cricketer, French appeared for Cambridge University between 1841 and 1844. He played three times in the University match against Oxford University, being joint captain with George Boudier in 1843 when his 32 in the second innings of a low-scoring game contributed to a Cambridge victory. French appears to have been regarded largely as a batsman, though it is not known whether he was right- or left-handed, but he also kept wicket on occasion and took two recorded wickets as a bowler in first-class games. After leaving Cambridge University, his cricket was confined to lesser matches, but as late as 1878, when he was 57, he was playing for Suffolk in a two-day match, albeit not successfully. French was ordained as a Church of England clergyman when he left Cambridge and from 1845 to his death he was the rector of Thrandeston, Suffolk. The post was a benefice in the gift of the Bateman family who owned nearby Brome Hall. French himself was also an extensive landowner and held public and judicial office: he was reported to be the last Freeman of Eye, chairman of the local Poor Law Trust and a member of the East Suffolk County Council."

  "text" : "Theodoric I (German: Theoderich, also Theodor or Dietrich) (?–916) was the Bishop of Paderborn from 908 to 916. Virtually no record of Theodoric's life and work has survived. However, it was the period of the Hungarian invasions of Europe and the conflicts between the Saxon and Frankish duchies. During the revolt by Duke Henry the Fowler against King Conrad the Saxon bishops aligned themselves with Henry. At the hill castle of Eresburg (Marsberg) in the Bishopric of Paderborn a bloody feud arose in 915 in which Theoderic was also supposed to have participated militarily. Theodoric died on 8 December 916 and is very probably interred in Paderborn Cathedral."

  "text" : "Theodore Moses Tobani (2 May 1855 − 12 December 1933) was a composer of popular music. He was born in Hamburg, Germany, and began studying violin when he was five years old. The family moved to the United States, where he attended the Rivington School in New York, but they returned to Europe when it became evident that Theodore was a musical prodigy. He was a concert violinist by the time he was 10. The family returned to the U.S. in 1870, and Theodore took positions as a violinist in several groups including Simpson's Theatre in Philadelphia, Wallack's Theatre, and several others. His best known composition was \"Hearts and Flowers\", which he composed in half an hour in 1893, and which continued to sell more than 100,000 copies annually until the end of his life. He was so prolific that his publisher, Carl Fischer, insisted that he use multiple pseudonyms; Fischer was concerned that nobody would believe how much Tobani was composing. Another popular work was \"Our Little Nestling\", written in 1883 for Mrs. Lester Wallack, for which he was paid $35. Tobani was also a real estate dealer and owned property in Queens. He died on 12 December 1933; seven children survived him, but his wife, Helen, had died some time earlier."

He served as president of several biological societies, including the Cooper Ornithological Club (as a three-time president), Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, the Society of Mammalogists, and the Wildlife Society, and was a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences which in 1968 awarded him the Fellow's Medal, the Academy's highest honor. Storer was born in San Francisco, California August 17, 1889. He attended the University of California, Berkeley where he earned a B.S. in 1912, followed by a M.S. in 1913. From 1914 to 1923 he worked in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology as an assistant curator of birds and field-naturalist. He worked with the ecologist Joseph Grinnell, with whom he co-authored Animal Life in the Yosemite and The Game Birds of California. Storer received his PhD from U.C. Berkeley in 1921, and in 1923 joined the faculty at the University of California, Davis, where he was the first professor of zoology and later founded the school's Department of Zoology. He retired in 1956 and was given a Doctor of Letters degree by U.C. Davis in 1960. A building on the campus, Storer Hall, is named after him. Storer died in Davis, California on June 25, 1973."

  "text" : "Tom Stuart (November 19, 1936 – November 16, 2001), was a pioneer in the development of the two-party system in the U.S. state of Mississippi. On June 5, 1973, he was elected as the first Republican mayor of Meridian, the county seat of Lauderdale County in eastern Mississippi. Stuart was reared in Meridian and California, while his father served in the United States Navy in World War II. He attended high school in Meridian as well as Meridian Junior College and the Florida Institute of Technology, known as Florida Tech, in Melbourne in east Florida. Stuart was affiliated with Rotary International, the Shriners, and the Chamber of Commerce. At the age of thirty-six, Stuart unseated Democratic Mayor Al Key, 4,606 (60 percent) to 3,070 (40 percent). Stuart listed his priorities as mayor as: \n* Openness in municipal government \n* Repairing streets, \n* Resolving downtown traffic problems \n* Raising employee salaries \n* Developing a system of mass transit. In the fall of 1974, Mayor Stuart greeted some 3,500 expatriate African Americans who returned to their former hometown of Meridian from all over the United States to celebrate \"Meridian Picnic Day\", an actual 72-hour homecoming. Some had been away for sixty years; many had left because of segregation, which was dismantled a decade earlier. One woman noted the irony: \"When I was living here, they didn't even allow us in this park. We couldn't even walk through it. Now they're bending over backwards to be nice to us.\" Stuart was a friend of another Meridian Republican pioneer, Gil Carmichael, the party's 1972 nominee for the United States Senate against James Eastland and its gubernatorial choice in 1975 opposite Cliff Finch and in 1979 against William F. Winter. During the last years of his life, Stuart had resided in the capital city of Jackson, where he worked with the Jackson Redevelopment Authority to obtain funding for an amphitheater in the city historic district. He was active in beautifying downtown parks and making public facilities accessible to the disabled and the homeless. Carmichael said that he and Stuart had talked about an amphitheater for Meridian as well. Stuart died in Philadelphia in Neshoba County at the home of his daughter, Betsy Stuart Allen (born c. 1957), a teacher at Philadelphia Elementary School. The news story of his death does not mention full name, occupation, spouse, church affiliation, name of high school, years of education, or burial site."

He became an actor by accident when in 1955 he accompanied a colleague to auditions for Nola Millar's production of Richard II with the Thespians company and ended up being cast as Bolingbroke in which he was very well received. He went on to appear as Worthy in Virtue in Danger for the New Zealand Players and Jimmy Porter in Look Back in Anger for Unity Theatre as well as appearing in radio drama and commercials. In 1964, Eliott was one of the founders of Downstage Theatre in Wellington, and acted in, designed and directed many of the early productions. He emigrated to Australia in 1968 where, in concurrent productions for the Old Tote Theatre Company in 1969, he played Hamlet in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" and Guildenstern in Tom Stoppard's \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\" before going on to a fruitful acting career in television and film and as a voice-over artist. (In the mid 1970s he had a continuing role as a sports reporter in the Crawford Productions series \"The Box\".)

In 1901, Benson became Treasurer of the ILP, Within the party, he became known as a leader of the right-wing. In 1909, when Hardie, Ramsay Macdonald, Philip Snowden and Bruce Glasier resigned in protest at the membership's willingness to oppose sitting Liberal Party candidates, he remained on the executive, working with J. R. Clynes and William Crawford Anderson to win the body to Macdonald's views. He also wrote extensively for the party, including a controversial pamphlet promoting eugenics in a future socialist state. Benson remained treasurer for twenty years, opposing World War I, but suffering long-term ill health. His son, George Benson, became a Labour Party Member of Parliament, and was also Treasurer of the ILP."

His previous roles include work as a police officer, barrister, Queensland Crime Commissioner, Family Court of Australia judge, and Chief Magistrate of the Magistrates Court of Queensland. He also presided over the 2013 Child Protection Commission of Inquiry. As Chief Magistrate, Carmody drew media attention for his comments and actions which were perceived as supportive of the Queensland government of Campbell Newman and their policies, including their laws against outlaw motorcycle gangs, for which he faced criticism from other senior lawyers and judges. His comments and actions were described in media reports as undermining the judiciary's independence from the government, particularly his move to effectively prevent other magistrates from hearing contested bail applications. Media also reported his lone expression of support as a judge for Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie, who had faced calls to resign after revealing the content of confidential discussions held with the President of the Court of Appeal. Carmody’s subsequent appointment to Chief Justice after nine months as Chief Magistrate was criticised by legal opinion, with criticism from several current and former judges and senior lawyers focusing on his perceived closeness to Campbell Newman’s LNP government, relative inexperience and lack of support from the legal profession and other judges for his promotion. Carmody was sworn in Chief Justice on 8 July 2014, following the elevation of his predecessor in the role, Paul de Jersey, to Governor of Queensland. Following ongoing tensions with other members of the judiciary, he resigned as Chief Justice on 1 July 2015. He remains a Judge of the Supreme Court, sitting as a supplemental member of the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal."

  "text" : "Thomas Burdick (November 17, 1795 (or 1797) – November 6, 1877) was a leader in the early Latter Day Saint movement, a Mormon pioneer, and a politician in Los Angeles County, California. Burdick was born in Canajoharie, New York. He married Anna Higley in 1828. In 1834, the Burdicks heard the preaching of missionary Sidney Rigdon and joined the Church of the Latter Day Saints led by Joseph Smith. The Burdicks moved to Kirtland, Ohio to join the main gathering of Latter Day Saints and Burdick was made an elder in the church. In 1836, he was given the responsibility of managing the membership records of the church. On November 7, 1837, Burdick became a high priest and a member of the presiding high council at Kirtland. In 1838, Burdick was one of the twelve high priests selected by Bishop Newel K. Whitney to constitute the first sitting of the Common Council of the Church, which heard charges levied by Sylvester Smith against Joseph Smith. Burdick also taught school and was a justice of the peace in Kirtland. In 1838–39, after the majority of Latter Day Saints left Kirtland, Burdick remained. He was appointed the church bishop in Kirtland on May 22, 1841. After the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, Burdick followed the leadership of Brigham Young and made plans to follow Young west. Burdick remained in Kanesville, Iowa until 1853, when he led a Mormon pioneer company of over 100 wagons to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. After arriving in Salt Lake City, most of the company, including Burdick, determined to carry on to the Mormon settlement of San Bernardino, California. In the winter of 1853–54, Burdick and his family settled at San Gabriel Township, California. In 1855, Burdick was elected as a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors; he served two consecutive one-year terms. Burdick died in Los Angeles of apoplexy. He and his wife were the parents of seven children. Their son Cyrus Burdick was the co-founder of Pomona, California. Burdick's sister was Rebecca Burdick Winters, a Mormon pioneer known for her grave site along the Mormon Trail."

Additionally, he is counted as one of the 20th century's premier woodcut engravers. The poet Gunnar Ekelöf wrote about Torsten Billman: \"To those, who with the word art visualise large, magnificent, 'striking' canvases Torsten Billman doesn't have not much to offer. His art serves the simple, neglected, homeless of existence. It features the fellows from the Nippon and other ships, marked by the hard life in ports as well as on board. His art shows the interiors of East End bars, where you get acquainted with the dark side of life. His art however isn't any 'social' art of the arrogant, placarding character there was so much of especially during the 1920's and 30's. It's social, not in attitude or trend, but with objectivity and revealing sharpness in the human portrayal that sometimes seems almost brutal - repulsive, but sadly true. Yet it's, however always carried by compassion. Never by sentimentality. This involves a simple statement of: 'Such is man'. But from the ravaged features, and the gout-ridden limbs stiff from work there's still a notion emanating of how man should look like and could look like.\""

In 1957 she appeared on a popular television quiz show, either Hold That Note or Name That Tune (sources differ), and won, gaining recognition for her powerful singing voice and her personality; she was 4 ft 10 in (1.47 m) tall, and nicknamed \"The Little Dynamo\". She was managed by Buddy Kaye, and first recorded for Coral Records, releasing several singles in the late 1950s but with little success. However, she released an LP, The 4 Seasons, on Coral in 1958, and was also a regular performer on the Sing Along television show, presented by Jim Lowe. By 1960, she was managed by Don Kirshner and Al Nevins of Aldon Music, and she began releasing singles on the Mercury label. Her only chart success came in 1961, when her recording \"Play It Again\", written by Gerry Goffin, Carole King and Howard Greenfield, reached #95 on the Billboard Hot 100. She also worked as a session singer on many of Goffin and King's demo recordings in the early 1960s. She continued to sing and perform comedy and impressions in clubs in New York, as well as in Las Vegas, and appeared on the Ed Sullivan and Johnny Carson shows. She died at home in Broward County, Florida, in 1996."

Shillington first came to prominent as the chairman of the Irish Land Committee on its formation in 1883, an organisation aiming to draw together numerous local tenant's rights bodies. At the 1885 general election, Shillington stood for the Liberal Party in North Armagh, but was not elected. The following year, he became the first president of the Irish Protestant Home Rule Association, a body of Liberals aiming to show that a significant number of Protestants in Northern Ireland supported Home Rule. At the 1895 general election, Shillington stood in South Tyrone as an independent nationalist, narrowly losing to the Liberal Unionist Thomas Wallace Russell. In 1911, he was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland, and then in 1923 to the recently founded Privy Council of Northern Ireland."

Greene was awarded an MFA degree from California Institute of the Arts in 1987. His classmates there included the artists Richard Hawkins and Catherine Opie, who jointly curated Greene's 2014 exhibition in the Whitney Biennial. David Frantz, curator at ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives curated a \"show within a show\" in the Hammer Museum's Made in LA Biennial, featuring Tony Greene's opulent paintings from 1987-1990, alongside queer and activist artists, documents, and ephemera in dialogue with his work."

The County Londonderry-born son of a Church of Ireland clergyman, Jones was descended from a 17th-century Welsh settler in Ireland. Several generations of his family had held public office in the Kingdom of Ireland, including membership of the pre-union Parliament of Ireland. Entering the navy aged 13 during the Napoleonic Wars, the teenage Jones survived several naval engagements and the burning of his ship at night when he was 16. After ten years serving under the captaincy of his step-mother's brother, Henry Blackwood, Jones reached the rank of commander by age 25, and captain at 38, but never actually sailed as a captain. Aged 40, Jones entered Parliament for County Londonderry, in the interest of the Marquess of Waterford.An Orangeman and Ultra Toryof \"plain unassuming manners\",he sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at Westminster from 1830 until he stood down from Parliament in 1857. A member of several learned societies, he occupied his retirement from politics by making the first comprehensive catalogue of Irish lichens, laying the foundation of Irish lichenology."

  "text" : "Theoktistos (Greek: Θεόκτιστος; fl. 802–821) was a senior Byzantine official who played an important role under the Nikephorian dynasty (802–813). Theoktistos is first mentioned in 802, when he held the rank of patrikios and the post of quaestor. From this post he supported the deposition of Empress Irene of Athens (ruled 797–802) and her replacement by Nikephoros I (r. 802–811). He remained active in Nikephoros' administration, and by the time of the Emperor's death in the Battle of Pliska in 811 he had advanced to the rank of magistros. He was among those who agreed to the accession of Nikephoros' son Staurakios to the imperial throne. Staurakios, however, had himself been grievously wounded in the battle, and Theoktistos, along with the Domestic of the Schools Stephen and the Patriarch Nikephoros, pushed through his replacement by his brother-in–law, the kouropalates Michael I Rangabe (r. 811–813)—although, if the narrative of Theophanes the Confessor, an admittedly hostile source, is to be believed, the decision was also influenced by the insulting manner in which Staurakios treated the senior officials, Theoktistos included. Throughout his brief reign, Michael Rangabe was completely dependent on the senior officials who had raised him to the throne. In 813, Theoktistos was a member of the group of officials which successfully advocated a war with Bulgaria. Theoktistos accompanied the army, but the campaign ended in a heavy defeat at the Battle of Versinikia. With a few other officials, Theoktistos was able to escape the disaster. Some time after that he withdrew to a monastery under the famed Theodore Stoudites, with whom he had corresponded. His retirement was possibly related to the abdication of Michael I and the accession of Leo V the Armenian (r. 813–820). Theoktistos is still recorded as being alive and in the monastery in 821."

Daughter of star dancers Guido Lauri and Anna Maria Paganini, she followed in her parents's footsteps (although against their will) by training with Attilia Radice at the Rome Opera. She entered the school at age 13, without having taken any previous dance classes, and after just three years she joined the company becoming a Soloist at the age of 18 years. A very versatile, gifted and impetuously talented artist, she danced a wide range of Ballerina roles from Kitri in Don Quixote to Balanchine's Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux and at the Rome Opera Ballet (where she stayed all career, from 1978 until 2011, while guesting elsewhere in Italy) she worked with a variety of personalities such as Rudolf Nureyev, André Prokovsky, Maya Plisetskaya, Ekaterina Maximova, Vladimir Vasiliev, Patrick Dupond and many others. Gold medal at Carlo Blasis 1981 competition in Turin and a recipient of various prizes (Apollon Musagète 1986, Golden Perseus 1987, Michelangelo's David 1988, Talenti dello Spettacolo Internazionale 1989, Berlin's Golden Bear and Cup 1990) she appeared on Italian TV as a performer but also as an anchorwoman. In 1987 American review Dance Magazine wrote about her unusual kinship with cousins Raffaele, Alfonso, Augusto and Fabrizio Paganini - famed dancers too - and with two paternal aunts, a paternal uncle and a maternal aunt and uncle that were all Rome Opera Ballet dancers of the older generation. Her genealogical tree also includes grandfather Eliseo Paganini, a world-champion athlete, and very famous opera singer Giulio Neri, her uncle. Since 2013 her off-stage partner is ballet teacher Fabio Grossi (dancer)."

  "text" : "Taurus do Brasil São Paulo, (Brazil), Milton Motta Peligrinetti May 11, 1925 – Tijuana (Mexico) February 25, 2009, hypnotist of the masses, one of the first theatrical hypnotists of the Americas, with more than 60 years of artistic career. He died from a heart attack in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. He was raised in the cities of Torrinha, Araraquara, and São Paulo, where he studied primary, secondary, and high school. He then attended the University of São Paulo, achieving highest honors in Psychology, Medicine, and Clinical Hypnosis. He traveled different countries, such as Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and various countries in Europe. The first direct contact he had with hypnosis was at a very young age. He had an uncle that was a famous and recognized hypnotist of the masses, the Italian Dr. Checarelli, who opened the doors of this wonderful world of dreams. Taurus would accompany him as assistant in his shows, and that was how he discovered all the marvels of the mind and dreams. As a young man he worked as a radio disc jockey, in Radio Tupi and Radio Record of São Paulo, Radio Banderantes and Mairininque Vega de Rio de Janeiro, at the same time as studying. He became one of the most prestigious and sought after disc jockeys of his era, due to his excellent voice. He was part of a cast of 21 people, actors of the moment in Theater and Radio Theater. He left his theater company at the age of 25 to fully dedicate himself to the artistic career of hypnotist of the masses, being recognized as the youngest hypnotist of the world. Here is where \"Taurus do Brasil\" started. Being recognized by the world press, different and innumerable medical colleges and universities of each country he visited, as one of the best in the world, applying and spreading his scientific technique, simple, nimble and modern, of the current hypnosis without mysteries or taboos. Throughout his life, he hypnotized more than 800 thousand people in the whole world, he has written 35 books, all of which are sold out; he is the only hypnotist that appeared in Chile in front of 75 thousand people and is (as the press indicates): THE MOST FAMOUS HYPNOTIST IN THE WORLD. At a conference in Colegio Médico de Paraguay, he performed for the first time a blood coagulation in less than 10 minutes in a hemophiliac person declared, under hypnosis, cataleptic. which was consented medically, for this experiment performed in front of over 500 doctors of the time, being a complete success under ovation of the professionals who afterward took a course in Clinical Hypnosis and its applications given by Taurus do Brasil. He received multiple acknowledgements, diplomas, Keys to Cities, honorific mentions from Universities, and Dr. Honoris Causa degrees [citation required]. The Institute of Clinical Hypnosis of Milan, Italy, and the University of Soborna in Paris, France, have deservedly awarded him a place in history for his valuable cooperation in medicine, and in all aspects of life and feelings of a human being. He died in Tijuana, northern Mexico, on February 25, 2009, victim of a heart attack."

  "text" : "Tom Leamore (24 August 1866 – 6 September 1939) was an English popular variety comedian, dancer and singer. He debuted at the Rodney Music Hall in 1880 and quickly grew into a successful stage performer, singing comically and dancing eccentrically with clogs. In December 1905 he portrayed Ali Baba in the pantomime of The Forty Thieves at the Marlborough Theatre, an experience he did not enjoy and never repeated. His best known song was Percy from Pimlico which he composed and wrote himself. He was featured singing this song in the 1968 documentary A Little of What You Fancy. Tony Barker of Music Hall Records referred to him as \"second only to Dan Leno\". In November 1937 Leamore joined The Old Timers touring company with fellow artistes Tom Costello, George Mozart, Arthur Reece, James Stewart, Tom E. Finglass, Ada Cerito, Nell Calvert and Lottie Lennox, appearing with them in various venues across the UK. In December 1937 he took part in an early television programme for the BBC called Cavalcade of Music Hall broadcast from the Alexandra Palace along with George Mozart, Marie Kendall, Lizzie Collins, Talbot O'Farrell, Walter Williams, Charlie Lee and Sable Fern. At the end of the same month he also appeared in the television broadcast New Years Eve Party with Sam Mayo and Daisy Dormer. During February to April 1938 he continued to tour with The Old Timers, and from August to December 1938 appeared in the touring revue Time Marches On. In November 1938 Leamore was invited to take part in a Royal Command Performance during which he performed The Lambeth Walk with Lupino Lane and various other Music Hall veterans. In August 1939 he took part in Flashbacks of 30 Years Ago with Wilkie Bard, Ida Barr and Lillie Lassah. Leamore married three times: to Mary Anne Fleming, actress Rose Hamilton and Florence Palmer. He died on September 6, 1939 and was buried in the Variety Plot at Streatham Park Cemetery."

  "text" : "Tzvetelina \"Lina\" Yanchulova (Bulgarian: Цветелина \"Лина\" Янчулова; born April 12, 1975 in Sofia) is a Bulgarian beach volleyball player. She represented her nation Bulgaria in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), along with her partner and younger sister Petia. As a junior player in her native Bulgaria, Yanchulova became a four-time National Champion with her club Levski. She trained for most of her beach volleyball sporting career in San Diego, California, United States, while directing and coaching at Coast Volleyball Club. Yanchulova began her collegiate sporting career in 1992 at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho, where she competed for the Idaho Vandals women's volleyball team. Crediting her parents, Ted and Nina, for instilling the qualities necessary for success at the highest level, Lina went on to achieve outstanding accomplishments in both indoor and beach volleyball. While playing for the Vandals, she led her team to four impressive victories at the Big Sky Conference Championships, being named Freshman of the Year, Academic All-American, and Player of the Year in 1996. Since 1998, Yanchulova competed professionally at the FIVB World Tour along with her sister Petia. The Bulgarian tandem also made their official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where they both placed seventeenth in the women's beach volleyball, defeating European bronze medalists Deborah and Rebekka_Kadijk along the way. Four years later, at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the Yanchulova sisters qualified for their second Olympic Games in the same tournament by obtaining their berth from the FIVB Grand Slam Series in Klagenfurt, Austria. Defeating the reigning European Champions of Germany in the pool round, the Yanchulova sisters advanced to the round of 16, but they were eventually eliminated in a dramatic battle against eventual Olympic silver medalists Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede of Brazil, placing ninth overall. Lina took the last name Taylor after marrying former NFL player Aaron Taylor. They have two sons."

  "text" : "Toshio Aoki or Tershui Aoki (1854, in Yokohama, Japan – 1912, in San Diego, California) was a Japanese American artist and painter who lived and worked in California at the turn of the 20th century. Aoki found significant success among the American upper class and was known for hosting social events. Guests of his are alleged to have included John D. Rockefeller and J. P. Morgan. He was born in Yokohama, Japan in 1854. He emigrated to the United States around 1880. He relocated to Pasadena, California, in 1901, to the Hotel Green, where he also had a studio. He was active until 1910 and died in San Diego on April 26, 1912. Aoki \"painted portraits and murals in the homes of prominent people and became very successful.\" His works were handled by George T. Marsh & Company. He exhibited at the World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893, and the Art Institute of Chicago gave him a showing in 1924. The Fine Arts Gallery of San Francisco State University said of him: \"Much of Aoki's early life in Japan is speculation, ranging from artistic pursuits (student of acting, or street artist) to the grand and spectacular (a Samurai opposed to the new Japanese government). . . . [he painted] 'spontaneous seki'e ('on the spot' or 'before the viewers' eyes'). He built a reputation as a storyteller, sketching comical figures and eventually landing an illustrating job with the San Francisco Call.\" After moving to Pasadena, Aoki \"worked hard to shed his reputation as an amusing character and storyteller and to be taken seriously as an artist. He began to work on 'Oriental receptions,' creating an atmosphere of a Japanese masquerade ball.\" He died in San Diego in on June 26, 1912."

  "text" : "Teresea 'Terry' M. Hayes is an American politician from Maine who is currently the Maine State Treasurer. A political independent, Hayes represented part of Oxford County, Maine, including her residence in Buckfield, Maine, as a Democrat from 2006 to 2014. She was unable to seek re-election to the Maine House of Representatives in 2014 due to term-limits. Following Hayes' 2010 re-election, she was named Assistant Minority Leader of the House Democrats. In November 2012, Hayes won a closely contested election by just 42 votes over her Republican opponent. Hayes earned a B.A. in government from Bowdoin College in 1980. From 1991 to 2004, Hayes served on the MSAD 39 (Buckfield, Hartford, Sumner) School Board, including a stint as chair. She earned her MBA from Thomas College in Waterville, Maine in May 2014. In 2014, Hayes endorsed unenrolled candidate for Governor Eliot Cutler. On December 3, 2014, Hayes was nominated by legislative Republicans to be State Treasurer of Maine, and she defeated the Democratic incumbent, Neria Douglass due to the support of Republicans and a minority of Democrats. She is the first independent to hold the office.  Hayes has said one of her goals as treasurer is to create an online tool to allow the public to view and track how state bond money is spent, for greater transparency."

  "text" : "Taro Yoko (横尾 太郎 Yokoo Tarō, born June 6, 1970), also written as \"ヨコオタロウ\", is a Japanese video game director and scenario writer, having worked most notably at now-defunct game company Cavia. He became known for his work on the action role-playing video game series Drakengard and its spin-off Nier. Yoko was born in Nagoya, Aichi, and studied at the Kobe Design University in the 1990s. While initially not intending to pursue a career in video games, after working at Namco and Sony, he joined Cavia and became the director and scenario writer for the first Drakengard game. He has since worked on every game in the series, as well as on mobile titles after becoming a freelancer after Cavia's absorption into AQ Interactive. Yoko has become known for his unconventional style of video games, incorporating odd design choices and dark stories. One of the main aspects of his work is exploring the darker aspects of people, such as why they are driven to kill each other, although he typically does not share common opinion on his story's dark natures. His writing technique, described as \"backwards scriptwriting\", involves outlining the ending of the story first and building the narrative backwards from that point. Due to his dislike of being photographed, he generally wears a mask when giving interviews or presenting games."

  "text" : "Tessa Hughes-Freeland is a British-born experimental film maker and writer living in New York City. Her films have screened internationally in North America, Europe and Australia and in prominent museums and galleries, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, and the KW Institute of Contemporary Art in Berlin. She has collaborated on live multi-media projects with musicians like John Zorn and J. G. Thirlwell. The co-founder of the New York Film Festival Downtown in 1984 and its co-director until 1990, she later served as President of the Board of Directors of the Film-Makers Co-Operative in New York City from 1998-2001. Hughes-Freeland has published articles in numerous books, including “Naked Lens: Beat Cinema” and “No Focus: Punk Film,” and in periodicals including PAPER Magazine, Filmmaker magazine, GQ, the East Village Eye, and Film Threat. Hughes-Freeland works in a variety of formats and mediums, and her films have been shown in diverse venues, ranging from internationally prominent museums to seedy bars in gritty neighborhoods. Her work frequently confronts acceptable normality in transgressive and sometimes provocative ways. Hughes-Freeland's website describes her work as \"confrontational, transgressive, provocative and poetic\". The critic Jack Sargeant wrote that Hughes-Freeland \"approaches filmmaking in a multiplicity of styles, ranging from classic narrative to experimental 'performances' and even a documentary.\" Hughes-Freeland was part of the No Wave Cinema movement that began in the mid-1970s on New York City's Lower East Side, which included Scott B and Beth B, Richard Kern, Nick Zedd, Jim Jarmusch, Tom DiCillo, Steve Buscemi, and Vincent Gallo. In the 1980s, this morphed into the Cinema of Transgression, in which she and other Lower East Side artists and filmmakers created no-budget films and art that contravened prevailing conventions of American society and challenged established, \"correct\" cultural norms. Among the earliest admirers of her work were the controversial, celebrated late artist and activist David Wojnarowicz, who bought her a super 8 camera for her filmmaking, and the writer, critic and curator Carlo McCormick, whom she later married."

  "text" : "Tollef Hansen Kilde (17 July 1853 – 2 January 1947) was a Norwegian forest owner, business founder and politician. He was born in Åmot as a son of forest owner Hans Tollefsen Kilde (1822–1882) and Oline Grini (1827–1871). He attended Sagatun Folk High School, the Norwegian College of Agriculture and the Forestry Academy in Tharandt. In 1878 he took over the family farm, Kilde. It fell out of use in 1927 because of economic problems, but was inherited by his son in 1938. He was married twice; first from 1880 to Pauline Iversdatter Arnestad (1858–1917), but the marriage was dissolved; then from November 1903 to Hanna Fredrikke Hansdatter Arnestad (1877–1955). Kilde was an active politician. Locally he was a member of Åmot municipal council from 1881 to 1925, serving as mayor from 1890 to 1893 and 1905 to 1910. For the Liberal Party, he was a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway during the term 1891–1894. In the 1909 election he was fielded as the Liberal candidate in the single-member constituency Søndre Østerdalen, but ended a distant fourth behind the Labour Democrat, Liberal Left and Conservative candidates. He later joined the Liberal Left Party, and in the 1921 election he was a minor ballot candidate for the Norwegian Agrarian Association, which had now entered politics (from 1922 as the Agrarian Party). Kilde had chaired Hedemark Agrarian Association, and served as deputy chairman of the Norwegian Agrarian Association, already from 1905 to 1907. He was a central board member from 1904 to 1908 and 1913 to 1934. Kilde's main endeavor was to develop Østerdalen in general, and Rena in particular. He was an financial, political and administrative contributor to the foundations of Osfallet Power Plant, Rena Kartonfabrik and Rena Træsliperi to continue local hydroelectricity and refinery of the region's rich forest resources; two bridges over the local rivers Glomma and Rena (1890); and the inclusion of a Rena Station in the Norwegian railway network. He also contributed to the foundation of the school in Rena, which is now a campus of Hedmark University College, the fire insurance company Aamot Brandkasse and the local co-op. A failed endeavor, however, was the construction of a channel in Glomma, all the way from Nedre Glomma to Storsjøen. Østerdalen would be \"the furute Canada\", wrote Kilde, if the plan were to come to reality. A separate Trysil Line on the railway network was never materialized either. Kilde was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1897, received the Medal for Outstanding Civic Service in silver in 1933 and the Norwegian Agrarian Association honorary medal. The main street in Rena is named after him, and a bauta has also been erected in the town."

He was born in St Pancras, London and died at Folkestone, Kent. As a cricketer, Latham was a middle-order right-handed batsman. After non-first-class trials matches in 1872, he played fairly regularly in first-team matches for Cambridge University in 1873, and he was picked for the University Match against Oxford University, in which he scored 0 and 48 in a match that Cambridge lost narrowly. The 48 was Latham's highest score in first-class cricket. In 1874 he played for MCC against Cambridge University in the university's match immediately before the University Match, and then was picked for his second game against Oxford; this time, he was less successful with innings of 1 and 4, and Cambridge lost the game by an innings. It was Latham's last appearance in first-class cricket, though he appeared in minor matches for amateur teams to the mid 1880s."

Van der Lee is the son of Antonij van der Lee (1923–2000), professor in German linguistics, and Maria Louise Kieviet (1923–2015), granddaughter of Cornelis Johannes Kieviet, who was the author of the Dik Trom series of children's books.

  "text" : "Tommy Gustafsson (born 2 July 1948), known as Tommy \"Gyxa\" Gustafsson is a former Swedish football forward. He began his football career in the small club, Åstorps IF, which he represented from age ten in 1958 until 1969. In 1970 he transferred to Landskrona BoIS, where he contributed to the promotion of this club to the Swedish top league, Allsvenskan, already during his first season for the club. He scored the opening goal in the first qualifying match (of three), against Sandvikens IF in front of 15 685 attenders at Landskrona IP. Two seasons later \"Gyxa\" and his Landskrona BoIS won the Swedish Cup. He also contributed to the clubs Allsvenskan bronze medals in 1975 and 1976. In the beginning of his time in BoIS, he played forward together with Sonny Johansson and Dan Brzokoupil. During his two last seasons for Landskrona BoIS, he played as midfielder instead. He represented Landskrona BoIS at 326 occasions and scored 56 goals. After the 1978 season he stepped down and played for the small club Kågeröds BIF His nickname was not related to football; as a young kid he could simply not pronounce his surname and \"Gustafsson\" became \"Gyxa\", and it is under that nickname he is remembered among the Landskrona BoIS supporters. He is still a frequent guest at Landskrona BoIS' home games. In the autumn of 2013 he was one of the most well-known people who signed a successful protest against introducing artificial turf at his former home ground as footballer."

Timothy was from a family steeped in rallying history and started his rallying career in the Rallysport Association Championship, competing in a Vauxhall Nova and winning a number of events in his class. He was into his second year in the British Rally Championship and was tipped to be a future talent in British and potentially World Rallying. His death came less than three months after three spectators were killed at the Jim Clark Rally. Cathcart's co-driver Dai Roberts was injured and airlifted to a Belfast hospital but made a full recovery. His brother Gareth Roberts, also a co-driver, died in a similar accident at the Targa Florio in June 2012."

Held at the Royal Albert Hall, and featuring the Royal Choral Society, it raised funds for the Royal National Institute for the Blind. The eight performances were so successful that he rebooked the hall and choir for the following year. He repeated the show every year until 1939, apart from 1926, the year of the General Strike. All but the first show featured 1,000 performers, 200 of whom were dancers. The production also toured other venues in the greater London area.

After the war, he became a surveyor to help support his family. He also served in county politics until the state of Illinois was formed in 1818. Cox was elected to its 1st General Assembly as a state senator, serving for two years. He then worked as Register of the U.S. Land Office in Springfield, Illinois, but fell into debt after some poor land speculation deals. Cox served again in the militia near the end of the Black Hawk War, then was appointed a surveyor of the resulting Black Hawk Purchase. He settled in Jackson County and was elected to the Iowa Territory house of representatives for three one-year terms. In 1840, Cox led a posse against a group of outlaws in what would become known as the Bellevue War. Cox was elected to the state assembly as a councilman in 1842 and served one two-year term."

  "text" : "Thomas \"Tom\" Fosmire joined the Central Intelligence Agency's Special Operations Group in the 1950s and was given responsibility (along with Tony Poe) in training Tibetan tribesmen to fight against the Chinese Communists in the early part of his career. The training occurred first at a base on Saipan in the Marianas islands but was later moved to a colder mountainous climate at Camp Hale, Colorado. One battalion was trained at Camp Peary, near Williamsburg, Virginia. After the Tibetan operation concludes, Fosmire landed with Tony Poe in Sumatra, Indonesia to supply and train mutinous forces there in an effort by the Eisenhower administration to destabilize the communist-leaning regime of Sukarno. He and Poe were evacuated from Sumatra by US Navy submarine when the troops they were training fled to the mountains. In the 1980s, Fosmire served in El Salvador and Honduras, training Nicaraguan rebel troops opposed to the Sandanista government."

Born in rural Illinois, Clark was orphaned at a young age and was adopted by an aunt. He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1890, then supervised a local school. Named an assistant professor at the university in 1893, Clark rose to full professor status in 1900. A favorite of university president Andrew S. Draper, Clark was named dean of the College of Literature in 1900, then dean of undergraduates in 1901. This office was later renamed Dean of Men, making Clark the first to hold the title. Clark was known for his ruthless vigilance over students and was particularly opposed to alcohol and automobiles. However, Clark was a friend to the Greek community in the university, rising to lead the national chapter of Alpha Tau Omega and often supporting the system in the press. He was also founded Phi Eta Sigma in 1923."

  "text" : "Thomas Proctor Hall (1858–1931) was a Canadian physician who wrote mathematics, chemistry, physics, theology, and science fiction. T. Proctor Hall was born October 7, 1858 at Hornby, Ontario. He attended Woodstock College and University of Toronto where in 1882 he obtained a bachelor's degree in chemistry. For two years he was a fellow at University of Toronto, then he served as science master in Woodstock, Ontario for five years. He proceeded to Illinois Wesleyan University for his doctorate. He then studied at Clark University where W. E. Story lectured on higher-dimensional space. Hall contributed to the topic with his article \"The projection of fourfold figures upon a three-flat\". He wrote, \"Rotation is essentially motion in a plane, and when another dimension is added to the rotating body, another dimension is also added to the axis of rotation.\" From 1893 to 96 he was professor of natural science at Tabor Academy, Massachusetts. Albert A. Michelson was teaching physics at Clark University. Examining methods of determining surface tension, in 1893 Hall published the article \"New methods of measuring surface tension of liquids\". The following year he contributed an article on stereochemistry to Science. And the next year he wrote on gravitation including the speculative kinetic gravity. From 1897 to 1901 he taught physics in Kansas City. T. Proctor Hall became a medical doctor in 1902 after study in Chicago at the National Medical College. At the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis in 1904 he spoke on \"Principles of Electro-therapeutics\" at the International Electrical Congress held in connection with the Exposition. From 1902 to 5 he was editor of American X-ray Journal. In 1905 Hall relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia where he practiced medicine as Thomas P. Hall."

  "text" : "Troso da Monza, also called Troso di Giovanni Jacobi, was an Italian painter of the Quattrocento, active around 1444 in Monza and Bergamo. Some frescoes originally in the church of Santa Marie delle Grazie in Bergamo have been attributed to Troso, where he appears to have collaborated with Giacomo Georgi de' Scannardi. Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo, in his Treatise on Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, has a chapter on the composition of grotesques, stating Troso da Monza has drawn a book full of so many different and powerful grotesque figures that I believe that there are no longer any more left to invent. In that book is actually recorded anything is possible in this kind of specialty. The frescoes depicting the History of Queen Thedolinda for a chapel in the Cathedral of Monza have been attributed by some to Troso, others have ascribed the frescoes to the brothers Zavattari."

  "text" : "Toh Kian Chui (Zhuang:  卓键水  October 1, 1927- November 9, 2000) is a philanthropist and multi-millionaire businessman in the construction industry from Singapore. Chui started one of the first road construction companies in Singapore, named the Swee Constructions in 1948. Swee Constructions paved the first runway for the Singapore Changi Airport in the 1960s. The company was also responsible for the building of the facilities in Kusu Island that was enlarged and transformed from two tiny outcrops on a reef, into an island holiday resort. Mr Toh was a generous contributor to many charities in Singapore, and was awarded both the Public Service Star (Bintang Bakti Masyrakat) and Public Service Medal (Pingbat Bakti Masyarakat) by the government of Singapore. Toh Kian Chui has a foundation named after him; the Toh Kian Chui foundation, which has donated S$20 million to the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine). With matching funds from the Singapore government, the total endowment for LKCMedicine – a partnership between NTU and Imperial College London – may go up to S$50 million. The gift has gone towards setting up an endowment to fund, in perpetuity, a Distinguished Professorship, a Gold Medal student award, scholarships, research and education. In recognition of the gift, the upcoming three-storey Annex at LKCMedicine's headquarters building at 11 Mandalay will be named after MToh Kian Chui."

  "text" : "Tazawa Inabune (田澤 稲舟), born Tazawa Kin (田澤 錦, 1874-1896), was a Japanese writer. She was born in Tsuruoka, Yamagata. Her father, a military doctor, did not approve of her writing ambitions. Her mother was a businessperson, and she also had a younger sister. She submitted works to literary journals and followed authors there. While living in Tsuruoka she had become corresponding with Yamada Bimyō, and had adopted the pen name Inafune. She departed for Tokyo with the stated purpose to attend the Kyōritsu Women's Occupational School, where she would learn how to paint. Melek Ortabasi, author of \"Tazawa Inabune (1874-1896)\", wrote that \"one may guess\" that the woman's \"real goal\" was to move to Tokyo since her father was strict, and her father had attempted to arrange a marriage. She met Bimyō as soon as she arrived, She enrolled in the school, but did not graduate, and she ultimately married him. According to Ortabasi, during Inabune's life, \"her fame had at least as much to do with the buzz surrounding her affair with Bimyō as it did her own talent\". During the marriage, Bimyō was having affairs with other women. Inabune lived with Bimyō's mother and paternal grandmother. Inabune had little skill in domestic chores, which would make her task of serving Bimyō's relatives difficult. The marriage attracted scrutiny from the press. After three months they divorced and Inafune was forced to return to her parents' home. The Yomiuri Shimbun published Inabune monogatari (\"The Inabune Story\"), based on the marriage. Inabune continued writing even when she was ill with tuberculosis. Ortabasi stated that this may have hastened her death. Inabune died at age 23, in late September 1896. Many newspapers reported that she committed suicide, and another stated \"mental derangement\" was the cause of her death. Ortabasi wrote that Inabune's death ended Bimyō's career \"in large part\" because Bimyō received criticisms for how he had treated Inabune. Hasegawa Shigure wrote a fictionalized biography of Inabune as part of Shuntaiki—Meiji Taishō josei shō (\"A springtime account—Portraits of women of Meiji and Taishō\"), a seven-part series that was serialized in Tokyo Asahi. Ortabasi wrote that compared to the Yomiuri Shimbun series, this was \"more sympathetic\". Inabune appears in Dawn to the West by Donald Keene. Keene wrote that Inabune's death was one reason why Bimyō lost his career, and he inaccurately stated that Inabune killed herself."

  "text" : "Thomas Skidmore (August 13, 1790 - August 7, 1832) was an American politician and radical political philosopher. Skidmore is best remembered as the co-founder and leader of the Working Men's Party in New York when it first emerged in the fall of 1829. He was forced out of the organization shortly after its initial electoral campaign by moderate leaders of the party on the grounds of Skidmore's excessive radicalism and unbending personality. Skidmore went on to establish an even less successful political organization in 1830, known as the Agrarian Party. Skidmore was the author of three books, including an ambitious and controversial 1829 political treatise written against the ideas of Thomas Jefferson, The Rights of Man to Property! This work depicted a two-class society consisting of a propertied ruling class and a propertyless majority inevitably subjected to a sort of economic slavery which made true liberty impossible. It advocated a constitutional convention to abolish debt, end the right of inheritance, and bring about the equalization of productive and personal property of the nation among its adult citizens."

Military service for World War II curtailed his football career, but he resumed playing and coaching in Wollongong and was selected to captain an Illawarra representative team against the visiting 1946 Great Britain Lions. Ezart also made a brief reappearance with the Canterbury-Bankstown club during the 1949 NSWRFL season before retiring from first grade rugby league. He later became a referee and a Canterbury club selector. On 12 February 1968, Ezart was elected as one of the Australian national team selectors for the upcoming 1968 World Cup campaign. Tom Ezart died on 23 May 1977. Ezrt was a life member of the Illawarra Rugby League, and in 2011, the centenary year of the League, he was one of the nominees for the five-eighth position in the Illawarra team of the century, but eventually was overlooked in favour of Bob Fulton."

As of September 2014, Tenkanen is ranked sixth in the world for the one-person dinghy class by the International Sailing Federation, following her successes at the European and ISAF World Championships. Tenkanen qualified for the Finnish squad in the newly introduced Laser Radial class at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing by placing twelfth and receiving a berth from the ISAF World Championships in Auckland, New Zealand. She posted a net score of 128 points to achieve a creditable twenty-second position in a fleet of twenty-eight sailors, edging out Belarus' Tatiana Drozdovskaya by a mere, thirteen-point gap on the tenth leg. Tenkanen sought to compete for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, but lost the slot to her sailing rival Sari Multala, who later finished seventh in the same class. Two years later, at the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships in Santander, Spain, Tenkanen delivered her best career record with a fourth-place finish in the Laser Radial class to secure a spot on the Finnish sailing team for her second Olympic bid in Rio de Janeiro."

  "text" : "Tetsuya Matsunaga (松永 鉄也 Matsunaga Tetsuya, born April 15, 1979 in Kyoto) is a Japanese sailor, who specialized in two-person dinghy (470) class. He represented Japan, along with his partner Taro Ueno, at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and has also been training for Three Bond Sailing Team in Kyoto throughout most of his sporting career under his longtime coach and mentor Kenji Nakamura. As of September 2014, Matsunaga is ranked twenty-sixth in the world for two-person dinghy class by the International Sailing Federation, following his successes at the South American Championships, ISAF Sailing World Cup Series, and 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships in Santander, Spain. Matsunaga qualified as a skipper for the Japanese squad in the men's 470 class at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, by placing fifteenth and receiving a berth from the World Championships in Melbourne, Australia. Teaming with crew member Taro Ueno in the eleven-race series, the Japanese duo mounted a marvelous lead in the opening leg, but came up short for the medal with a net score of 97 and a seventh-place finish in a fleet of twenty-nine boats. At the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships, Matsunaga and his new partner Yugo Yoshida set a best career record with a sixth-place finish in the men's 470 class to secure their spot on the Japanese sailing team for the 2016 Summer Olympics."

Her record was beaten two throws later by Menis, and then by Melnyk. Melnyk would later go on to set the masters world record in the W35 division eight years later just after the Moscow Olympics. Danilova had to wait another sixteen years after the fall of the Soviet Union before she set her first masters world record, in the W55 division in 1996. That record of 43.36 m still stands.

  "text" : "Tolga Tanriseven (Turkish: Tolga Tanrıseven) is a Turkish American entrepreneur from St. Louis who since 2008, has served as the president of GirlsAskGuys, a multilingual platform that allows men and women to pose questions to those of the opposite gender about social life, which is currently based out of University City, Missouri. Tanriseven received his Bachelor's degree in computer engineering from his native Turkey in 2001, and received a full scholarship to emigrate to the United States and attend Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) where he started graduate school in 2003. However, he left after being offered a software engineering job at MonsterCommerce in 2004. His inspiration to start GirlsAskGuys stems from wanting to minimize the gender gap, after feeling \"sorry for the guys stumbling around in downtown bars\" trying do get dates: I kept seeing a lot of rejections from both sides...It wasn't about who approached who. Instead the issue I kept seeing was guys were approaching girls the ways they thought was right or cool instead of figuring out how girls liked to be approached. Vice-versa was true as well in the rare cases where a girl approached a guy.--Tolga Tanriseven Tolga Tanrisevn was able to raise $1 million for GirlsAskGuys in order to \"add other languages at the rate of one every two or three months\", making this social media platform reach an international audience, in addition to its current English-speaking users, as well as its Turkish-speaking audience. As such, in May 2014, Tanriseven added Spanish compatibility to his brainchild, GirlsAskGuys. In 2015 Tolga was included on the \"40 under 40\" list on the St. Louis Business Journal.  He has been featured in media like Forbes, The Next Web, Huffington Post and the Search Engine Journal."

This made him the first ever individual men's medallist for Brunei at the Asian Games and only the fourth medallist in the country's history. He attempted to qualify at the 2006 Asian Games, but ultimately did not compete. He won the second international medal of his career at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games. Initially third placed, he was upgraded to the silver medal after Malaysia's runner-up Rayner Kin Sion was disqualified for doping. This gave Brunei three silver medallists in the sport, alongside HJ Johari and Sim Chung Hlang in the lower weight categories.

  "text" : "Toivo Villiam Alavirta (27 June 1890, Tammela - 23 June 1940, Ust-Vym; original surname Ahlström; name as Soviet citizen Тойво Казимирович Алавирта) was a Finnish journalist and politician. He was a member of the Parliament of Finland from 1917 to 1918. In 1918, during the Finnish Civil War, Alavirta worked in the administration of the Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic. When the Red side lost the war, he fled to Soviet Russia. He joined both the Communist Party of Finland and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and worked as a journalist and a party functionary in the Karelian ASSR. In 1935, Alavirta was accused of nationalism and excluded from the Communist Party. On 23 August 1937 he was arrested by the NKVD and sentenced to eight years in prison. He died on 23 June 1940 in a prison camp in Ust-Vym, in the Komi ASSR. He was posthumously rehabilitated by Soviet authorities in 1955."

In 1033, Tash Farrash was sent on an expedition to Ray against the Turkmens, who had been causing disruption in the area; Tash Farrash managed to defeat the Turkmens and execute 50 of their chiefs, which included a prominent one named Yaghmur. However, Tash Farrash's tyranny towards the inhabitants of Jibal made Mas'ud I replace him with Abu Sahl Hamduwi as the governor of the region. Tash Farrash was later sent on another expedition against the Turkmens, but was defeated and killed by them sometime in the mid-1030s."

He was educated at the University of Dublin and entered Lincoln's Inn in 1674. He was called to the Irish bar and became King's Counsel in 1685. He was a barrister of repute, and enjoyed the patronage of Charles Porter, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. In 1692 he was recommended for promotion as one of the three serjeants-at-law, being described as \"the fittest that can be picked on for the King's service\". He became Second Serjeant, with a knighthood, and was made Prime Serjeant in 1695, on Porter's recommendation, holding that office until his death in 1703. He was MP for Augher 1695-1699. He married firstly in 1673 Mary Nelmes, daughter of Richard Nelmes, an Alderman of London, and secondly in 1696 Mary Bellingham, daughter of Sir Daniel Bellingham, first of the Bellingham Baronets of Dubber, who had been created the first Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1665. Thomas had several children by his first marriage, including: Edward Pakenham (died 1721), his eldest son, who married Margaret Bradestan, and was the father of: \n* Thomas Pakenham, 1st Baron Longford."

Lightner was inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 1999. According to Victor Mollo:No man stood so close to the emperor of bridge, Ely Culbertson, as Ted Lightner... For a part of the celebrated Battle of the Century match he was Ely Culbertson's partner - it was the part during which Culbertson gained his entire advantage over Lenz. He was in the Culbertson team which defeated the British in 1930, '33 and '34, and after winning every major event in America - Spingold, Vanderbilt, Life Master Pairs - he was at the top once more as world champion in 1953."
