He represented his nation Kyrgyzstan in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004) and also captured two silver medals each in the 54 and 55-kg division at the 2001 Asian Wrestling Championships in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea. Kalilov also trained throughout his sporting career for Ryon Wrestling Club in Bishkek under his personal coach and father Yusup Kalilov. Kalilov made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's bantamweight division (54 kg). He won his opening preliminary competition match with U.S. wrestler Steven Mays on technical superiority and edge past Egypt's Mohamed Abou Elela with a 3–1 verdict. Facing Ukraine's Andriy Kalashnykov to close the pool, Kalilov could not hold tightly over his opponent and lost the match by a comfortable 3–0 decision. Placing second in the pool and eighth in the final standings, Kalilov's performance fell short to put him through to the next round. Shortly after the Games, Kalilov came strong with a bronze medal effort at the 2001 Asian Wrestling Championships in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and went on to finish fourth at the World Championships in Patras, Greece few months later, losing 1–3 to Olympic silver medalist Lázaro Rivas of Cuba. He also entered the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea as a medal favorite in the 55 kg class, and picked up a bronze over China's Wang Hui by a close 6–5 verdict. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Kalilov qualified for his second Kyrgyz squad, as a 23-year-old, in the men's 55 kg class. Earlier in the process, he placed sixth and received a spot on the Kyrgyz wrestling team from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Créteil, France. Unlike his previous Olympics, Kalilov delivered a catastrophic game plan in the preliminary competition. He lost three straight matches: China's Sheng Jiang by a 3–3 draw and a double warning, Greece's Artiom Kiouregkian by a pin, and Denmark's Håkan Nyblom by a 3–0 verdict. He was ranked eighteenth in the final standings."

Belonging to the dynasty of the Banu Sumadih, she had three brothers who were also poets, two of which were: Raf al-Dawla and Ubayd Allah. Ibn Idhari claims that intelligence princess was so surprising that her father raised her with her brothers, surpassing all in the art of poetic composition. This author refers to the only literary works that remain from the princess, love poems dedicated to as-Samar, a eunuch of great beauty originating in Denia, taking part in the government of the kingdom, which allowed him to be near Princess. When the father of Umm al-Kiram, King Abu Yahya, knew of the affair between the two, made the eunuch murdered. Her most famous poem is as follows: Marvelously, friends, of what has harvested a burning passion therefore not for that, there would be lowered, accompanied by the moon, the night, from the highest heaven to Earth. My passion is that I love in such a way that if I broke up, my heart would follow him.Oh, I wish I knew.If there is a way to be alone together which do not reach the ears of the spy. How wonderful I want to be alone with my beloved living, even when it is in my gut and in my chest."

  "text" : "Urs Leupold (July 19, 1923 – October 9, 2006) was a Swiss geneticist whose studies of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe were instrumental in establishing this organism as a key model system for eukaryotic cell and molecular biology. Leupold began his studies of S. pombe in 1946 upon encouragement by Øjvind Winge. In 1947, Leupold determined that a culture of S. pombe str. liquefaciens contained strains expressing four distinct mating types: h40, h90, h+, and h−. Most current S. pombe laboratory strains are derived from the h90, h+, and h− strains known as 968, 975, and 972. Leupold went on to carry out postdoctoral studies with Norman Horowitz at Caltech and with Boris Ephrussi at the University of Paris. Notably, with Norman Horowitz, Leupold isolated the first conditional (temperature sensitive) mutations in the bacterium Escherichia coli as part of an effort to address criticisms raised by Max Delbrück of the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis In 1952, Leupold returned to studying S. pombe first at the University of Zürich from 1952 to 1963 and then as head of the Institute of General Microbiology at the University of Bern from 1963 to 1986. During this time, his laboratory made major contributions to the understanding of genetic mutations and suppressors in S. pombe, as well as the construction of a genetic map of this yeast. As the recognized leader in fission yeast genetics, Leupold had a great impact on the first generation of scientists to use S. pombe for genetic studies. In 1973, Paul Nurse spent a couple months with Leupold to learn S. pombe genetics before beginning his seminal studies on cell cycle control with Murdoch Mitchison in Edinburgh, Scotland. Other notable S. pombe scientists who trained with Leupold include Peter Munz, Jürg Kohli, Herbert Gutz, Matthias Sipiczki and the late Pierre Thuriaux."

On 21 January 1217 Ulrich was given Ilzgau by the Emperor Frederick II to hold as a banner-fief. Thus, the Emperor made him the first Prince-Bishop of the Bishopric of Passau. Ulrich II and his successors were thus henceforth rich princes ex officio. At the end of June, 1217, Bishop Ulrich inaugurated in a large feast day the first four altars of Lilienfeld Abbey. In 1219, Ulrich II allowed himself to erect on Georgsberg a castle, the Veste Oberhaus. He also founded several monasteries in the eastern part of the diocese. Ulrich died on 31 October 1221 on the Fifth Crusade in Damietta, Egypt."
