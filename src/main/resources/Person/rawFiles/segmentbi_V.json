  "text" : "Vika Koto Lusibaea (born 28 June 1964) is a Solomon Islands politician. She was born in Fiji. With no more than a primary school education, she ultimately went into business, attaining a managerial position in a private company. Having married a Solomon Islander and established her home in the Solomons, she became a naturalised citizen of that country. Her husband is Jimmy \"Rasta\" Lusibaea, who was a warlord, one of the leaders of the Malaita Eagle Force, during severe ethnic conflicts in the Solomons in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. After serving time in prison, he went into politics, and was elected to the National Parliament as independent MP for the North Malaita constituency in the 2010 general election, then immediately appointed as Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources in Prime Minister Danny Philip's government. In October 2011, he lost his seat in Parliament and his position in the Cabinet upon being convicted for grievous bodily harm and assaulting a police officer, for events dating back to the interethnic violence a decade earlier. His expulsion from Parliament led to a by-election for his seat, held on 1 August 2012. Jimmy Lusibaea asked his reluctant wife to stand in the by-election, essentially to represent him in Parliament in his place. At that stage, there had only ever been one woman elected to Parliament in the country's entire history since its independence from the United Kingdom in 1978: Hilda Kari had been an MP from 1989 to 2001. Jimmy Lusibaea later told the magazine Repúblika that when he had proposed and endorsed his wife as a candidate, he had had to overcome strong prejudice in the constituency against the notion of a woman MP: \"Tobaita, the name of our region itself, means men are bigger or more important than women and this is the mentality of us Tobaitans. I told them three things: first, that the Westminster system of government is a foreign concept with a woman, Queen Elizabeth, at its head. It is not a cultural entity otherwise I would not be putting Vika forward as a candidate. Secondly, I told them we need Vika to be elected in order for our work and the programmes we started to continue, and finally I challenged them to make history by becoming the first constituency in Malaita province to elect a woman to parliament.\" The couple obtained the support of \"the chiefs, church leaders and community leaders\" before the election. Vika Lusibaea campaigned on a promise to continue her husband's work. Standing as an independent against nine male candidates in the by-election, she won 49.2% of the vote, with more than three times as many votes as her closest competitor. There was some slight controversy over her victory, critics drawing attention to the fact she was a Fiji-born naturalized citizen, and to her \"limited literacy skills\". Her husband swiftly announced that he would not allow her to be interviewed by foreign media, informing the media simply that she would apply the same policies as his own. She herself later explained: \"I only came in so he could continue all the work being done. I am just there so we have someone sitting in the chair in order for us to have access to the funding and the projects. Everything else is the same\". Repúblika drew a sharp contrast between her entry in politics and that of Hilda Kari, \"an independent politician acting on her own conscience\", who had \"campaigned and won on her own merit\". Lusibaea took her seat as a backbencher in Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo's National Coalition for Rural Advancement government. In June 2013, she spoke in a conference panel on the state of democracy in the Pacific, at the Australian National University. (Among the speakers was only one other MP from a Pacific Island country: Vanuatuan anthropologist and government minister Ralph Regenvanu.)"

Sampla, who studied till Class 10, joined the party in 1998. He is the second minister from Punjab after Akali Dal's Harsimrat Kaur Badal. His political journey began after he was elected the Sarpanch or head of his Sofi village (Jalandhar District). He has held several key posts in the BJP's Punjab unit. When he was a 27-year-old bereaved dalit, Sampla was trying to find his feet against the oppressive landlords of Jalandhar's Sofi Pind. His brother and he were left to fend for themselves after their father's death and Sampla went off to Saudi Arabia in 1979 to work for a plumbing company. On his swearing-in as BJP's first minister from Punjab in NDA-II, he says, \"I often recall one incident that shaped my life. While I was in Saudi Arabian city of Damam, I was asked to clean human excreta and repair a bathroom. I was young and flatly refused to do the cleaning part while telling the building owner that I was a plumber. On my insistence, the man put on plastic gloves and cleaned the muck himself. It taught me the difference between oppression against dalits and the will to work\", Sampla recalled."

Virarajendra surrendered on 24 April 1834 and was taken political prisoner to Benares. He went to England in March 1852 to demand in court that the East India Government return his wealth. Queen Victoria received the king with royal treatment and he let the daughter to the care of the queen. Gowramma was also under the care of Major Drummond and his wife who had travelled on ship along with the Raja. Gowramma was baptized on 5 July 1852 in a ceremony conducted at the Buckingham Palace by the Archbishop of Canterbury with the Queen as godmother (sponsor) giving her the name of Victoria. Gowramma married Lt. Col. John Campbell despite the schemes of some to marry her in a Christian wedding to the exiled Indian prince Duleep Singh. They had a daughter Edith Victoria Gouramma Campbell born on 2 July 1861. Gouramma died in 1864 and was buried at Brompton cemetery. A marble bust was made of her by Baron Marochetti and is now at the Osborn House in the Isle of Wight. Edith Victoria married Henry Yardley, son of Sir W. Yardley, and had a son Victor."

Zimmerman wrote and directed the Claudia Jennings roller derby drive-in film Unholy Rollers and collaborated with Terrence Malick on the script to the road movie Deadhead Miles. He is most well known for his horror slasher film Fade to Black, a dark and despairing psychological study of an awkward and alienated hardcore film buff who exacts a harsh revenge on his cruel tormentors. Zimmerman received a Saturn Award nomination as Best Director for the film, a predecessor to more well-known modern parodies of the horror genre. Vernon also wrote the scripts for the horror-Western Hex (a.k.a. Charmed), the redneck crime exploitation film Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw, the made-for-TV wrestling comedy/drama Mad Bull, the failed TV pilot film Shooting Stars, and the teen fantasy comedy Teen Witch. Zimmerman's latest film is the six-minute comic short Chuck and Wally on the Road. More recently Vernon has been working as a script analyst. He also teaches screen-writing courses at UCLA's Extension and Certificate Program. Zimmerman also taught classes on both writing feature scripts and directing actors for film and television at the USC School of Cinema and Television. Vernon Zimmerman lives in Los Angeles and is a member of both the Writers Guild of America and the Directors Guild of America."

He is well known for his works in group theory and is the founder of the Novosibirsk school of finite groups. Mazurov is a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Mazurov's parents Daniil Petrovich and Evstolia Ivanovna were teachers. Victor went to elementary school in a village of Kuvashi and finished high school with highest honors in Zlatoust. He then moved to Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) to study mathematics in Ural State University. His advisers in Sverdlovsk were Victor Busarkin and Albert Starostin. In 1963 Mazurov married his university classmate Nadezhda Khomenko. After graduating in 1965, they moved to Novosibirsk where Mazurov joined the research staff of the Sobolev Institute of Mathematics (Russian: Институт математики СО РАН). Mazurov is an editor (with Evgenyj Khukhro) of the \"Kourovka Notebook\", a periodically updated collection of over 1,000 open problems in Group Theory. Mazurov obtained several results that contributed to the proof of the classification of finite simple groups, also known as the Enormous Theorem and considered one of the greatest achievements in mathematics of the 20th century. He is one of the initial group of fellows of the American Mathematical Society."

  "text" : "Vadim Zaurbekovych Tasoyev (also Vadym Tasoiev, Ukrainian: Вадим Заурбекович Тасоєв; born January 13, 1975 in Vladikavkaz, Russian SFSR) is a retired amateur Ukrainian freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's heavyweight category. Considered as one of Ukraine's top freestyle wrestlers in his decade, Tasoyev had claimed four career medals (two silver and two bronze) in the 96 and 97-kg division at the European Championships, picked up three bronze at the World Championships (2001, 2002, and 2007), and achieved top fifteen finishes in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Tasoyev trained as a member of the freestyle wrestling team for Olympik Kiev Sport Club, under his head coach Ruslan Savlokhov. Tasoyev made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's heavyweight division (97 kg). He lost his opening match to neighboring Russia's Sagid Murtazaliev, who later claimed the Olympic gold at the end of the tournament, without receiving a single point on the morning session, but wrestled his way to edge out U.S. wrestler and two-time Olympian Melvin Douglas with a 5–1 decision. Finishing second in the prelim pool and eleventh overall, Tasoyev's performance fell short to put him further into the quarterfinals. Shortly after his first Games, Tasoyev emerged into the global scene with a blistering bronze medal effort in the men's 97-kg division at the 2001 World Wrestling Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, and then continued to deliver another one at the same tournament in Tehran, Iran by the following year. With two medals added to his career hardware, Tasoyev entered the 2003 World Wrestling Championships and came strong as a top medal contender. Though he finished eighth in the men's heavyweight division, he was officially selected to the Ukrainian Olympic team, and earned a ticket to his second Olympics. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Tasoyev qualified for his second Ukrainian squad, as a 29-year-old, in the men's heavyweight class (96 kg) by receiving a berth and placing eighth from the World Championships. In the prelim pool, Tasoyev eclipsed Switzerland's Rolf Scherrer with a 6–1 decision on his opening bout, but could not grapple Russian wrestler and defending European champion Khadzhimurat Gatsalov into the ring, as he had been beaten by his fresh opponent without collecting a single point. Tasoyev failed to advance further into the quarterfinals after finishing the pool in second place and fourteenth overall. Tasoyev moved up to the super heavyweight class from 96 kg after his second Games, and was determined to fight against his formidable opponents at the 2007 World Wrestling Championships, where he picked up his third career medal. He sought to compete for his third Olympic bid in Beijing, but decided to officially announced his retirement from wrestling for personal and political reasons."

In the same year, he wrote a book named \"The Ottoman Empire of the Twentieth Century\". Cardashian entered the New York State Bar Association in 1909 and began practicing law. In 1913 he was the Fiscal Agent of the Ottoman Empire in the US. Prior to the Armenian Genocide of 1915, he served as a counselor and statistician to the Ottoman Chamber of Commerce in America and was a counselor for the Ottoman Embassy in Washington, D.C. and then to the Ottoman Consulate General in New York from 1910 to 1915. He authored several books on the Armenian Question. Some authors claim otherwise, but in his 1934 obituary it's stated that Cardashian was survived by his sister, mother and brother. In early 1919 he founded the American Committee for the Independence of Armenia (ACIA), the predecessor of the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA).

He competed in the 1960 Olympics finishing fourth behind his teammates Robert Shavlakadze, world record holder Valery Brumel and American John Thomas. During the course of the competition all four equaled the Olympic record, Shavlakadze, the first jumper in the order set the record first. Based on current rules, Bolshov would have tied Thomas for the bronze medal, but at the time jumpers were penalized for the number of attempts and Bolshov took seven attempts during the competition to Thomas' five. In 1961, Bolshov jumped 2.16 m in Grozny, at the time he was the number three high jumper in the world. Bolshov continued jumping, returning to the Olympics in 1968, but not making the final. In 1974, he equalled his 2.16 at the Soviet National Championships in Moscow, at age 35 setting the Masters M35 World Record. The record would stand for 17 years. Bolshov is married to Valentina Maslovskaya, a Soviet sprinter who also competed at the 1960 Olympics; their daughter Olga Bolşova became an Olympic high jumper. According to Valery Brumel's wife, Vladimir Vysotsky originally devoted his \"Song about high jumper\" (Russian: Песенка про прыгуна в высоту) to Bolshov. Later, when Brumel heard the song, he \"decided\" that it is about him, which Vysotsky did not mind."

Thanks to her, music from the island of El Hierro got to be known in the rest of the Canary Islands, and even in the rest of Spain. Valentina was recognized in all of the Canary Islands because of her voice. She helped to popularize traditional songs from El Hierro such as El Baile del Vivo, El Tango Herreño, La Meda, El Conde de Cabras and, specially, El Arrorró Herreño. For Doña Valentina, ancient culture was the most valuable. Such as she repeated in the refrain of the Baile del Santo song: old people's customs should not be abandoned. Valentina is considered an iconic figure of Canarian folklore. She was an excellent drum player and singer that used to teach young people the songs and dances of her island. She managed to preserve the musical heritage of her ancestors. As a side note, she also used to work preparing medicinal baths in Sabinosa's Pozo de la Salud along with her husband Esdras by 1949, and in her village she was famed as a midwife."

  "text" : "Vladimir Yarets (Владимир Алексеевич Ярец) (born May 5, 1941) is round the world traveler from Belarus. He was born in the Soviet republic of Belarus. In early childhood he became deaf from a blast during World War II. From childhood he had great aspiration for traveling. As a teenager he crossed the Soviet Union from Minsk to Magadan, covering c. 36,000 kilometres (22,000 mi) in 148 days on a Jawa 50. Later he made many other trips around the Soviet Union on motorbike. On May 27, 2000 he began his current round the world trip in Minsk, Belarus. He traveled around Europe, into north-west Afrika to Western Sahara region to Morocco. Then he crossed Atlantic Ocean from Spanish Canary Islands into Venezuela. He traveled many Latin America countries until he reached United States. By late 2005 he visited every state of United States of America including Hawaii and Alaska and every Canadian province. In the city Peoria in Illinois he was hit by a truck while stopping at the side of a road in October, 2013. He had 29 fractures and spent 2 months in hospital and several more months recovering at the place of local friends. His 1990 Jawa 350 motorcycle was a write off, the US Biker community banded together to help him, and the local BMW dealership gave him a new BMW F650GS motorcycle as a gift to continue his travels. At end of 2006, he was in Sydney, Australia after circumnavigating the Australian continent as well as a 3000 km detour to the Red Centre and touring Tasmania. Vladimir was met by members of the RMOA Australia and presented a custom silver \"Round the World\" ring. He then shipped to New Zealand and then to Hong Kong. He also indicated he wishes to travel to Japan and mainland China. Vladimir enjoys meeting people, \"talking\" to everyone he meets and showing them pictures of his travels, and he is especially proud of his X-Rays. In 2009 it was reported he had covered more than 100,000 miles (160,000 km); in 2010 it was reported that he had covered 740,000 kilometres (460,000 mi) on his travels through 138 countries. Yarets arrived in the southernmost city of Japan, Ishigaki (located on Ishigaki Island), on November 6, 2010."

  "text" : "Vera Olenchenko (born March 21, 1959) is a Soviet born athlete. While she was one of the best long jumpers in the world, she did not make it beyond domestic competition in the prime of her career dominated by a crop of top long jumpers including Olympic champion Tatyana Kolpakova, world record holder Galina Chistyakova, Tatyana Skachko, Yelena Belevskaya, Tatyana Rodionova, Nijolė Medvedeva, Irina Valyukevich and Larysa Berezhna. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the following creation of new republics, Vera was credited with the indoor long jump record for Uzbekistan, which she still holds at 6.82m. While most of her contemporaries disappeared from the scene, Olenchenko continued jumping and made it to an international championship, not representing Uzbekistan but Russia at the 1997 world indoor championships. Her lifetime best was 6.92 from 1985, which ranks tied for the 96th best of all time. But she nearly duplicated that with a 6.90m on June 14, 1996. At the time she was 37 years old and it became the new masters W35 world record. While her record would last for four years before it was surpassed by Heike Drechsler, it remains the exact age 37 world record. It is the only exact age record between 17 and 38 not held by the big three women of long jumping; Drechsler, Chistyakova and Jackie Joyner Kersee Four years later, Olenchenko added the W40 record."

He owned the first successful photography studio in Los Angeles where he photographed many famous Californians in the 1870s in 1880s. After returning to Sweden, Wolfenstein owned Atelier Jaeger, the official court photographer's studio in Stockholm, from 1890 to 1905. He was a pioneer in his field and possibly the first in Sweden to make interior pictures in theaters using flash-lamp photography. He took pictures of theater scenes and actors' dressing rooms. A particular skill he developed was taking \"look-alike pictures\", a double exposure technique that combined images of the same person in two different poses, for example, sitting and standing."

  "text" : "Vladimir Viktorovich Orlov (Russian: Влади́мир Ви́кторович Орло́в; 31 August 1936 – 5 August 2014) was a Russian novelist, notable for his fantasy novel Danilov, the violist. Orlov was born in Moscow, but during World War II was evacuated to Mari El. Between 1954 and 1959, he was a student at the Faculty of Journalism of the Moscow State University. Subsequently, he took a job as a reporter with the Komsomolskaya Pravda working at the constraction of the Sayano–Shushenskaya Dam and Tayshet-Abakan railroad, and at the same time started to write short stories, mainly under influence of Vasily Aksyonov. He published his book of short stories \"Doroga dlinoy v sem' santimetrov\" (The seven centimetre road) in 1960 and the novel \"Solyony Arbuz\" (The salted watermelon) in 1965. In 1969, Orlov published his novel, Posle dozhdichka v chetverg, and decided to become a full-time writer. Between 1969 and 1975, all books of Orlov which he submitted for publication were rejected for ideological reasons. In 1975 he published the novel \"Proishestviye v Nikolskom\" (An incident in Nikolskoye) a psychological drama about the rape of a girl by her classmates and the legal processing afterwards. In 1980, Orlov published Danilov, the violist, which immediately gained popularity. The protagonist of the novel, Danilov, can not decide whether he is more a demon or a human, and runs into a trouble with his demon superiors (who require that he should be an enemy of humans). The novel is full of mythical creatures such as \"house spirits\". Fantasy genre was not common in the Soviet Union at the time, and this added to the popularity of the novel, which eventually became the first part of the Ostankino Stories cycle. Two more novels followed to complete the cycle: Aptekar (1988) and Shevrikuka (1997). The cycle genre is considered to by Magical Realism influenced by Nikolai Gogol, Fyodor Sologub and Mikhail Bulgakov. Danilov, the violist is often compared with Doctor Faustus by Thomas Mann since both novels study the diabolic and human origins of artistic creativity. In the 1990s and the 2000s Orlov was teaching at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow."

  "text" : "Victor Ramos (born 14 April 1970) is a retired East Timorese boxer. He was one of the first athletes to represent East Timor at the Olympic Games, when he competed at the Men's lightweight Boxing event at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, though he technically competed as an individual athlete because East Timor was newly independent and had not yet been formally recognized by the International Olympic Committee. He was also the flag bearer for the Independent Olympians at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Ramos was one of the ten East Timorese athletes who received training in Darwin prior to his participation in the Sydney Olympic Games. However, he lost in round 1 against Ghanaian boxer Raymond Narh and did not advance any further. Besides competing in the 2000 Summer Olympics, Ramos also competed in the 1997 Southeast Asian Games, where he won a bronze medal representing Indonesia. The Sydney Olympics followed East Timor's declaration of independence from Indonesia in 1999, and the ensuing violence, and Ramos, like many other East Timorese, fled into the hills with his parents and siblings to escape from the violence."

  "text" : "Vinayak Narayan Patwardhan (Marathi: विनायक नारायण पटवर्धन) (22 July 1898 – 23 August 1975), also known as Pandit Vinayakrao Patwardhan and Patwardhanbuwa as an Indian vocalist of Gwaliar-genre of Hindustani classical music. His uncle Keshavrao provided him with initial training in music. Those days musicians were associated with various vices and never received due respect in the society. To dispel these notions, Vishnu Digambar Paluskar set up music schools so that boys from respectable families could take up music as a profession. Vinayakrao was one of the first products. In 1907, he went to Gaandharva Mahavidyalaya at Lahore, where he was taught by Vishnu Digambar Paluskar directly. His guru not only taught music to his students but also inculcated good habits in them. Under Paluskar's tutelage young Vinayakrao imbibed his principles and discipline. As a result he became one of the important singers of his times and also earned due respect for his austere lifestyle and dedication to the art of music. Vishnu Digambar Paluskar wanted his disciples to emulate his example and take up the teaching profession. Vinayakrao accepted teaching assignments at the various branches of the school at Bombay, Nagpur and Lahore. Vinayakrao’s sweet and high-pitched voice impressed everyone including the actor-singer Balgandharva. On one occasion the great Gwalior veteran Ramkrishna buwa Vazhe had thrown a challenge to singers in Pune. Vinayakrao accepted it and learnt complex ragas from Vazhe buwa. Vinayakrao's fellow-students such as Omkarnath Thakur did not like this. But Vinayakrao considered the idea of learning from a veteran singer like Vazebuwa much more important than standing on false prestige. His ability to take the right step at the right time benefited others also. In the late forties as Bhimsen Joshi was searching for the right teacher he happened to meet Vinayakrao in Jalandhar. The latter advised Bhimsen Joshi to learn from Sawai Gandharva and it proved to be an invaluable suggestion. Vinayakrao Patwrdhan took up roles in Marathi musicals and was perhaps the first classical vocalist to have sung for a film. However, heeding his teacher’s admonition and advice, he later went to Pune and established a branch of the Gaandharva Mahavidyalaya there. Though he was young, he decided to dedicate himself to teaching music and ignored the lure of the drama and films. He trained a number of disciples who became famous singers and teachers in their own right. They include his guru’s son D.V. Paluskar, the eminent singer, who died at an early age later. At the time of his father's death, D.V. Paluskar was only 10 years old. Even as Vinayakrao Patwardhan and Pandit Narayanrao Vyas taught him music they noticed in the young boy a reluctance to conform fully to the Gwalior gharana. They encouraged the youngster to develop his own independent style and D.V.Paluskar grew up to be a well known vocalist. Vinayakrao Patwardhan’s singing reflected the simple and straightforward approach to ragas, which is the characteristic of the Gwalior Gharana style. As a singer Vinayakrao specialized in taranas which proved very popular with the audiences in India and overseas. His favourite ragas included Bahar, Adana, Multani, Malhar, Jaijaivanti, Hamir and Bhairav-bahar. The energy and effervescence in his music made him a much sought-after performer. He went around the country performing in most of the important music festivals. He was a great success with the audiences. He was also one of the few practising musicians of the time who took the trouble of writing textbooks on music. In his seven-part Raaga Vigyan series, Vinayakrao described the important aspects of various ragas as well as their grammar. In his concerts and recordings his fellow-student Narayanrao Vyas accompanied Vinayakrao. Their duet concerts became very popular. Vinayakrao received the Padmabhushan in 1972. Vinayakrao also led the Indian cultural delegation to USSR and other countries. One of his disciples, Pt. L.R.Kelkar settled down in Madras ( Chennai) and the author, Rohiniprasad happened to learn sitar from him initially. Not so much known is that among Pt. Kelkar’s better known disciples, is also the violin virtuoso N. Rajam, who went on to learn later from Pt. Omkaarnath Thakur in Benares FTII ( Film & TV Institute of India ) has also made a documentary by Aruna Raje while she was a student of FTII in the 60s He was awarded the Padma Bhushan award in 1972 by the President of India.

  "text" : "Victor Laurentius Hartman (30 December 1839 – 15 June 1898) was a Swedish actor. Hartman studied at Kungliga Teaterns Balett (The Ballet Company of the Royal Theatre) and at Mindre teatern in 1854 to 1856, followed by studies at Kungliga Teaterns Dramatiska Scen (The Dramatic Stage of the Royal Theatre) between 1856 and 1861. At the latter he had actors Johan Jolin and Carl Gustaf Sundberg as teachers. In 1861 he was employed at Dramaten (The Royal Dramatic Theatre) and in 1866 became lead actor at Dramaten. He was for a long time Dramaten's most used actor, and was known for both his lighthearted comedy acts and his more serious works. Among the first of Hartman's roles that received attention was the role as Paddy in the play Richard Sheridan and as Madinier in Fruarna Montambèche. He is best known for the roles he played in the 1870s and early 1880s, when he played the character Carlo van der Not in Victorien Sardou's Allt för fosterlandet. He also played Henri in De onyttiga, and during that period of his career also acted in the plays Don Cesar de Bazano, Volontären, Ferréol, Ambrosius, and as Gerald in Rolands dotter, de Nanjac in Falska juveler and Achille in the play Christiane. At the end of March 1885 Hartman suffered from several long bouts of lung disease which prevented him from performing until October of that year. His health never fully recovered and he had to settle for smaller parts and could no longer cope with the workload of playing every night. His last role was as Junot in Madame Sans-Gêne. Hartman was awarded the medal Litteris et Artibus in 1882."

He was the son of Nikita Lazarev, a Moscow architect, and was related by blood to Wassily Kandinsky. Viktor studied at the Moscow State University in 1917—1920, and graduated from the Faculty of History and Philology. From 1924 to 1936 he worked as a Chief Curator, head of the art gallery department, and Deputy Director for Research at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts. He later taught at the Moscow State University, and since 1961 headed the faculty of History of Foreign Art. The faculty library was named \"Lazarev cabinet\" in his honour. He is buried at the Vagankovo Cemetery. Lazarev was a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences since 1943. The Art History Institute in Moscow owes its origin to Lazarev's efforts. His magnum opus is The History of Byzantine Painting, published in 2 volumes in 1947 and 1948. It was translated into Italian as Storia della pittura bizantina (1967). Lazarev was also known for his many writings on the Italian Renaissance, its beginnings and the evolution of Western portrait painting."

Her artwork can be found in the Vatican Museum and numerous private collections. The focus of her work revolves around the human being beyond the physical dimension. Although her work often deals with the human figure, the figure itself is no longer a purely physical body, but rather a metaphysical entity transcending space and time. The titles of all her works are musical, reflecting the vibration that she believes is at the source of all life. Harvard scholar and Professor of Art History at the Australian National University in Canberra, Sasha Grishin, has said of her work, \"Light, which permeates all matter, is allowed to irradiate her forms, sometimes dissolving the flesh to leave only patterns and contours. Although the figure retains the centrality in her work, it is no longer a purely physical entity, but increasingly a metaphysical creation.\""

He represented France, along with his partner Pierre Leboucher at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and also became a member of the French national sailing team for five years before retiring shortly after the Games. Throughout most of his sporting career, Garos has been training for Ouest Nautical Sport Club (French: Sport Nautique de l'Ouest) under his personal coach Didier Bernard. Garos qualified as a crew member for the French squad in the men's 470 class at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London by finishing sixth and receiving a berth from the ISAF World Championships in Perth, Western Australia. Teaming with his partner Leboucher in the opening series, the French duo fell behind the pack on the early races, but sailed smoothly at the very end to achieve a creditable seventh position against a fleet of twenty-seven boats with an accumulated net score of 90 points. Shortly after the Games, Garos decided to retire from sailing to embark upon his formal business career role in the sport sector. Whilst training and competing for the sport, Garos completed a Bachelor of Arts in material sciences and engineering, worked part-time in the technical sales department of an industrial company and fulfilled a one-year contract in the navy."

  "text" : "Born in London in 1910, Valfried (Val) Zethrin was a scion of a Prussian-Swedish family. Having originally fled social unrest in Prussia in the early 19th century the family settled in Stockholm, Sweden, before moving to London, England in 1870.Val's early life was largely uneventful, though his godfather, the adventurer and gentleman racer Arthur Andrews, was responsible for his passion for motor racing. The two families had originally met socially in London and holidayed together in the pre-war years at Sandown, IOW.At the age of 16 Val was bought a commission in the London Regiment, though was subsequently Gazetted in 1929 for bankruptcy.His godfather arranged for him to assist at motor racing events, notably Brooklands. It was here, whilst lap charting in July 1935 that he first met Adrian Squire, and was introduced to the notable Squire sports car. Upon his Bankruptcy discharge in 1936 he persuaded his godfather to finance the purchase of a long-chassis VDP tourer, and in short order bought the entire stock of parts when the Squire Car Manufacturing Company was placed in Voluntary liquidation the next year.The prewar period was difficult for Val Zethrin, being only able to sell two of the remaining cars. After the end of the war Val Zethrin pursued a new project, an updated and simplified attempt at the Squire concept, called the Zethrin Rennsport. The approach for this incorporated the Swedish concept of LAGOM which demands that engineering solutions be pared down to the minimum to deliver the functionality required. This resulted primarily in a simple execution of all the services required in the car, and necessitated a review of the exotic Anzani engine.The reliability and cost of the R1 Anzani engine had always been an issue when used in the Squire, and post-war conditions rendered it unthinkable.Through the good offices of the Allen-Bowden design company, contact was made with Donald Healey, who recommended using a souped up Riley Motor engine, as he had employed in the Healey-Abbott, with all-enveloping bodywork designed by Benjamin Bowden. This was derived from early work on the Veritas.Suspension and modified frame from the Riley stable retained the 102\" wheelbase of the short chassis Squire, providing the back-bone for what was to be an interesting but doomed venture.180 bhp from the heavily modified engine was forecast suggesting that the target 135 mph maximum speed was achievable. It seems that this project went little further than a road-going prototype with aerodynamic bodywork, though British driver Geoff Richardson was signed up to drive in competitions. Zethrin did not have the technical expertise of Adrian Squire, and failed to ensure sufficient industry interest in what seemed a flight of fancy, in an era of austerity.Lack of funds and backers falling away put paid to the Rennsport becoming available for purchase.There was a final glimmer, when Zethrin sold the remaining Squire in his possession to an American car dealer, Charles Davison, who was signed up to promote the Rennsport in The USA.No more was heard of the car until 2007, when the heavily damaged remnants of Val Zethrin's automotive property came to light, stored in a derelict coachhouse at Sandown, on the IOW."

In 1912, she commenced her studies in Philosophy at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau. From a fellow student, Lutz Kricheldorff, who was the first actor to perform Ahriman in Rudolf Steiner’s Mystery Plays, she was introduced to the literature of Anthroposophy, about which she had previously heard in Russia and Finland. In 1913, Kricheldorff took her with him to the performances of the Mystery Plays in Munich and a short time later, the two were married. The marriage lasted but a few years, and she continued her studies in Berlin, where she was present at Rudolf Steiner’s public lectures in the “Architektenhaus” (GA 52 – 67) and left deeply impressed by the rhetorical skills of the lecturer, which inspired her for her later work as a lecturer in Britain. During WW I she earned her living working in a children’s hospital. When Rudolf Meyer got her a job at the „Institut für Seeverkehr und Weltwirtschaft“ she moved to Kiel The first Anthroposophical Group in Kiel developed out of this initial circle of friends. Inspired by the “Hochschulkurse” (GA 322) in Dornach in 1920, Violetta asked Rudolf Steiner how she could best become engaged on behalf of Anthroposophy. He asked her to become Class 1 teacher for the new Waldorf School in Stuttgart. In 1923 she took on the task of introducing Steiner education into the new school of Margaret Cross in Kings Langley, England. She remained in England, taking up an independent activity as travelling lecturer and counselor in Steiner education, which made her, as Cecil Harwood acknowledged in his obituary of her “one of the best known and loved members in Britain” Perhaps her primary engagement was with the Workers Educational Association (WEA), a worker’s educational community in the industrial centres of Britain, under whose auspices she could communicate culture and anthroposophy in her personal warm-hearted manner. A motor accident brought her work to an end in March 1966 and she died at Epiphany in 1968."

Lapin, Chairman of the USSR State Committee for Radio and Television (Gosteleradio), Mulerman, along with several other singers of Jewish descent, was de facto barred from appearing on television. Since 1989, he lived in the U.S., where, in Florida, founded and managed a children's musical theater. As of 2008, he lived in Kharkov and worked in a youth musical theater."
