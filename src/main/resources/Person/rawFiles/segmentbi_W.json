DeWolf was passionate about the arts, amassing a collection of Anders Zorn works that he donated to the Art Institute of Chicago. DeWolf was an etcher himself, and some of his works were showcased at the Art Institute. A room there was named the DeWolf Gallery of American Landscapes in his honor.

He was an independent member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1938 to 1956, representing the electorate of Chaffey . MacGillivray was born at Inverness in Scotland, the son of a blacksmith. He fought with the Royal Horse Artillery in Egypt and Palestine during World War I, but suffered badly from malaria when he returned home. He migrated to South Australia in 1922, taking advantage of a free passage offered to returned soldiers and hoping that the climate would improve his health. He thereafter became a fruitgrower at Barmera. He also served as chairman of the District Council of Cobdogla. MacGillivray was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1938 election, at which independent candidates won 14 of 39 seats and 40 percent of the primary vote, more than either of the major parties. MacGillivray was eventually defeated by Liberal and Country League candidate Harold King at the 1956 election after the LCL and the Labor Party exchanged preferences in order to dislodge him, a decision that saw an \"intense struggle\" within the LCL at the time. He had been seen as a \"bitter critic\" of the policies of the Playford LCL government."

His 1883 comedy The Rajah was panned by critics but commercially successful, playing for 256 shows in New York before going on the road. He also acted some roles, and published a number of poems, including a volume titled Wishmaker's Town in 1885 which was republished in 1898 with an introduction by Thomas Bailey Aldrich.

  "text" : "Washington Shirley, 2nd Earl Ferrers (22 June 1677 – 14 April 1729), styled Hon. Washington Shirley until 1714 and Viscount Tamworth from 1714 to 1717, was a British nobleman and soldier. The second but first surviving son of Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers (by his first wife, Elizabeth Washington), he matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford in 1693. In 1695, he was commissioned an ensign in the Coldstream Guards. From 1713 until 1715, he sat for Fore in Ireland, apparently on his wife's interest. Upon the death of his nephew Robert Shirley, Viscount Tamworth in 1714, he adopted that title as heir apparent to his father. He succeeded to the earldom in 1717, but the estates were much diminished by his stepmother's jointure and bequests to his brothers and half-brothers. He had married Mary Levinge (d. January 1740), daughter of Sir Richard Levinge, 1st Baronet, around 1704. They had three daughters: \n* Lady Elizabeth Shirley (1704 – 17 August 1734), married Joseph Gascoigne Nightingale and had issue. A remarkable monument to the couple exists in Westminster Abbey. \n* Lady Selina Shirley (1707–1791), married Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon \n* Lady Mary Shirley (25 September 1712 – 12 August 1784), married Thomas Needham, 9th Viscount Kilmorey, without issue Appointed Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of Staffordshire in 1725, he died in 1729. The earldom, for lack of male issue, passed to his brother Henry, a lunatic."

As a reporter, Honan set (and continues to hold) the record for the most stories published in the New York Times Magazine (over 30). Honan also helped solve one of the biggest and longest unsolved art thefts of the 20th century: the disappearance of over $200 million worth of medieval treasures from Quedlinburg, Germany at the end of World War II. Honan was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his investigative reporting on this story. The quest to find the \"Quedlinburg Hoard\" later became the subject of one of Honan's numerous critically acclaimed books."

Born at Christ Church, Oxford, where his father was a professor and canon, Shirley was the second but only surviving son of Rev. Walter Waddington Shirley (d. 1866) and his wife Philippa Knight. Educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford, whence he took a B.A. in 1887, Shirley entered the profession of architecture and was articled to Basil Champneys. Part of the Arts and Crafts Movement, he was an active member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and the Art Workers Guild. He designed a large addition to 35 Victoria Road, Kensington in 1896. Shirley's obituary described him as \"a most conscientious architect...over-exacting, if anything, in his own work\". On 9 July 1890, Shirley married Mary Jane Moon (d. 10 Jan 1944), daughter of the barrister Robert Moon and the sister of Edward Robert Pacy Moon, by whom he had five children: \n* Lady Margery Joan Shirley (25 November 1891 – 1 June 1952), married Lancelot Sackville Fletcher on 22 September 1920 \n* Elizabeth Mary Shirley (30 December 1892 – 9 November 1893) \n* Robert Shirley, 12th Earl Ferrers (1894–1954) \n* Lady Phillida Shirley (4 November 1896 – 26 December 1985), under the name of Sister Mary Phillida a recluse at the Anglican shrine to Our Lady of Walsingham \n* Hon. Andrew Shirley (29 December 1900 – 20 June 1958), married Ethel Muriel Lewis on 30 April 1927 and had issue, art historian In 1912, Shirley succeeded his childless fourth cousin as Earl Ferrers, and largely retired from architecture to tend the family estates.

  "text" : "Walter Wischniewsky (16 September 1912 – 1 February 1995) was a German film editor who worked on over a hundred productions during his career. Wischniewsky also sometimes worked as an assistant director. Wischniewsky began his career during the Nazi era, but most productions he worked on were post-Second World War. He edited several rubble films, including The Berliner (1948). During the 1950s and 1960s he became one of the mainstays of German commercial cinema, working on the long-running Edgar Wallace and Karl May series. Wischniewsky edited Fritz Lang's Indian-shot The Indian Tomb and The Tiger of Eschnapur (both 1959)."

In the 1970s, Wright joined the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party, and was elected as its Chairman. He stood for the party in North Antrim at the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention election in 1975, and was elected. He later followed the party leaders in joining the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), and was elected to Ballymena Borough Council for this new party at the Northern Ireland local elections, 1981, He lost his seat at the 1985 election, and did not stand in 1989, but was re-elected in 1993 and won again in 1997. He also stood for the Northern Ireland Forum in 1996, but was not elected. In 1998, he resigned from the UUP, and stood unsuccessfully in the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election as an independent Unionist. He held his council seat in 2001, before finally standing down in 2005. Outside politics, Wright took over the family business, moving it into the construction of buses, a process which saw it become the Wright Group, with Wrightbus as its best-known subsidiary. In the 2011 Birthday Honours, he was awarded the CBE."

  "text" : "William T. \"Will\" Baker (born January 19, 1965) is an American perennial candidate from Tacoma, Washington. Baker, described by the Tacoma News Tribune as \"a roadside flower salesman with a history of annoying elected officials,\" has run for Pierce County Auditor, Washington state Auditor, United States Senator, Tacoma city council, and mayor of Tacoma, among other offices, but has never won a contest. He has been repeatedly arrested for speaking past his allotted time during public comment periods of the Tacoma city council, then refusing to yield the floor. On one occasion, in 1997, he continued his monologue after being booked into the Pierce County jail, even refusing to stop after jail guards left the door to his cell open \"hoping he'd leave.\" (According to another report of that incident, Baker refused to leave jail after having bail posted by an acquaintance as he'd learned his landlord had evicted him. Sheriff Mark French attempted to convince Baker to leave jail, but Baker chose to remain in his cell.) In the 2004 race for state auditor, the Washington State Republican Party nominated Baker as their candidate after efforts to recruit someone else failed, though later admitted they were unaware of his colorful past and had not properly vetted him. (Under Washington elections law at the time, candidates listing party affiliation had to have received endorsement from the party in question; under current state elections law candidates can list affiliation with any party whether approved by that party or not.) Another Washington perennial candidate, Richard Pope, attempted - unsuccessfully - to have Baker removed from the ballot. Baker ultimately lost the election with 32-percent of the vote. Baker's frequent electoral campaigns have been motivated by what he's explained is institutional corruption that has engulfed Tacoma municipal and Washington state government. In the 2004 election for Auditor he declared the \"number one issue ... ought to be the attempts by the FBI to cover up the events surrounding Crystal Brame’s murder\" (David Brame was a Tacoma chief of police who murdered his wife, Crystal, before killing himself) while, in his 2010 run for United States Senator, he opined that \"Secretary of State Sam Reed and several County Auditors are manipulating the 2010 U.S. Senate election.\""

  "text" : "Wallie Herzer (né Walter Henry Herzer; 15 April 1885 San Francisco – 15 October 1961 Redwood City, California) was an American composer of popular music, music publisher, and pianist. Herzer flourished in music prior to and during World War I. The Columbia recording of his 1912 composition, \"Everybody Two-Step\" — performed by ragtime pianist Mike Bernard on December 2, 1912, in New York City — is the first recording of ragtime music. It became a hit and coincided at the start of a renewed craze for ragtime and dance — fifteen years after William Krell's \"Mississippi Rag\" had been published, the first known published music with \"rag\" in the title. Several other recordings of \"Everybody Two-Step\" became hits. Herzer composed three other hits — a 1913 piano rag, \"Tickle the Ivories\" – which also became hit as a vocal arrangement; a 1914 foxtrot song, \"Get Over, Sal\"; and a 1916 Hawaiian waltz song, \"Aloha Land\". Other compositions — including his 1908 piano ragtime two-step and barn dance, \"The Rah-Rah Boy\", and his 1913 rag turkey trot, \"Let's Dance\" — were internationally distributed."

  "text" : "William Julius D. (\"Bill\") Escher (1931 – May 12, 2014) was an aerospace engineer involved in the early development of the United States rocket programs and long time aerospace industry visionary. He was an internationally recognized expert in the field of high-speed airbreathing propulsion and hypersonic flight. He was a long been a proponent of combined-cycle propulsion systems for space access and his visionary 'Synerjet' concept is industry recognized. He wrote over a hundred technical papers on this subject and others such as hydrogen energy and lunar exploration. He had a long career in aerospace spanning more that 60 years. While in the Army and assigned to the Naval Research Lab (NRL), he was a countdown officer for the Vanguard rocket program in 1957. He was later employed by NASA (Lewis, Marshall, and Headquarters), Marquardt, Kaiser-Marquart, North American Rockwell and Rocketdyne, Astronautics Corporation of America, University of Toronto, Escher Technology Assoc., Escher-Foster Technology Assoc., SAIC, and SpaceWorks. He was also one of the co-founders and long time members of the Space Propulsion Synergy Team (SPST). He was the author of the SAE book entitled \"Synerjet Engine: Airbreathing/Rocket Combined-Cycle Propulsion for Tomorrow's Space Transports.\" In 1988, he was awarded the prestigious AIAA George M. Low Space Transportation Award for excellence in the field of space transportation. His Low award citation reads: \"For outstanding and sustained contributions to the field of space transportation, from Vanguard to Spaceliner, and for tirelessly promoting a vision for low cost, reliable access to space based on the Synerjet combined-cycle engine.\" He held a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree from George Washington University, having earlier undertaken studies in mechanical engineering at Cornell University and Cleveland State University. At Cornell, he served as the president and experimental committee chairman of the Cornell Rocket Society. He also conducted graduate studies at the University of Southern California and the University of Wisconsin-Madison."

  "text" : "William Cattley (1788 – 8 August 1835) was an international merchant and horticulturist. He was significantly involved with the trade between Britain and Russia, including the importation of grain (generically called \"corn\") to England. He also collected, and had others collect on his behalf, plants from locations throughout the world. He was particularly fond of orchids. Cattley was born in Garlickhythe ('garlic dock'), City of London, to a large merchant family. Many of Cattley's factors were members of his extended family, for example his cousin John Prescott headed up the firm's offices in St. Petersburg from which he ran the Russian side of the trade. Prescott was an enthusiastic collector of plants, and forwarded large numbers back to England for Cattley. In 1818 Cattley was unpacking a shipment that he had received from Brazil. Among the various materials he found un-preposessing tendrils which might be an orchid, so he nurtured it back to health and it turned out to be the beautiful orchid, which Lindley named in Cattley's honour as Cattleya labiata (the \"corsage orchid\"). The year previously William Swainson had discovered the orchid in the wild in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco and dispatched a specimen along with other plants to Cattley via the Glasgow Botanic Gardens. To help with his collection Cattley had hired John Lindley to draw, describe and catalog the novel plants in his garden at Barnet. Cattley paid for the publication of Linley's monograph on digitalis, Digitalia Monographia, and later for Lindley’s Collectanea Botanica (1821) a catalogue of Cattley’s plant collection. However, after 1821 due to financial reverses, Cattley was no longer able to pay Lindley a salary. William Cattley died at his home, \"Cattley Close\", Wood Street, in Barnet on 8 August 1835. A blue plaque has been placed on the house which says: William Cattley, Botanist, 1788-1835, lived in this house."

The Act of Union in 1800 abolished the Parliament of Ireland, and Ireland was allocated 100 seats in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at Westminster. Waterford was one of the 31 boroughs which were selected to retain parliamentary representation, and a ballot was held to choose which of each borough's MPs should be co-opted as the initial holder of the single seat which would be allocated to them in the new parliament. Alcock was chosen by ballot as Waterford's first Westminster MP, in preference to his colleague Robert Shapland Carew. At the general election in 1802, Alcock was returned as to Westminster for the new single-seat borough of Waterford.He had beaten Sir John Newport by 471 votes to 470,but an election petition was lodged. The petition was upheld, and on 1 December 1803 Alcock was unseated and Newport declared elected."

His name appears for the first time in the register of vicars-choral at Wells in 1555. Payments received by him around this time suggest that he was also employed as composer and copyist to the Wells Cathedral. Only a few of his compositions survive and most are incomplete. Among them can be cited an Easter antiphon Christus resurgens in two sections, based on a Sarum Rite plainchant; and a motet Anima Christi for three voices, which was originally just one section of a much longer motet for six voices. William Parsons is believed to be the same \"W. Parsons\" who composed 81 out of the 141 settings in John Day's The Whole Psalmes in Foure Parts. The Flatt Service by \"Mr. Parsons of Wells\" was also probably written by him; the location was added to distinguish him from \"Mr. Parsons of Exeter\", whose music features in the same source."

A right-handed batsman, Armistead was a member of a cricketing family: his brother Henry played first class cricket, while brothers John and Robert, and nephew William, all played school cricket. Armitstead played fourteen first class matches between 1853 and 1862, the majority for Oxford University with solitary appearances for the Gentlemen of the North, Manchester Cricket Club, and the Marylebone Cricket Club. Armitstead was also a founding member of the Free Foresters Cricket Club, along with his brother Henry. It was during a match between a United England XI and the Free Foresters in 1861 that he is credited with the introduction of the white coat for cricket umpires. Armitstead requested that the umpires wear something white in colour, as their existing garments were causing him to lose sight of the ball and the bowlers hand during their delivery. Armistead had a modest batting record, scoring only 293 runs in twenty-five innings at a batting average of 12.20. 249 of these runs were made for Oxford, for whom he made eleven appearances. His best was a score of 38, made opening the batting against the Marylebone Cricket Club on 3 June 1853. He took six catches, and is noted as having bowled however his bowling style or statistics are not recorded. Born in Holmes Chapel in Cheshire, he died in Goostrey aged 73."

  "text" : "William Miller Bowen (about 1865–1937) known as the \"Father of Exposition Park\" in Los Angeles, California, was a civic leader in that city in the 20th Century and a member of its City Council. He was born on a farm in Indiana during the American Civil War, and he also farmed in Oklahoma before moving to California. Bowen was a member of the City Council in 1900-04, and as acting mayor in 1904 he vetoed a council resolution that would have placed a bond issue of $250,000 to build a new city library in Central Park, today's Pershing Square. The library was later built on the site of the Los Angeles State Normal School on Fifth Street. Almost from the time he landed here he became interested in the tract which he afterward dedicated as Exposition Park. At that early day the place was known as Agricultural Park. . . . On it were a race track, a rabbit chasing course, a clubhouse and two saloons which formed a hangout for race-track touts and gamblers. One day he found some of his Sunday-school pupils visiting the race track and rabbit course, and that impelled him to help organize a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and he \"fostered measures which outlawed gambling in the community and ended coursing and racing\" in the park. In the 1910s, he was active in keeping the land on which Exposition Park is now built from being developed by private interests, arguing successfully in state courts for public ownership. He was a member of the park's Board of Governors, resigning in 1936. A bronze tablet was dedicated in his honor in the State Building within the park, and an oak tree was given his name. In 1914 he was chairman of the Los Angeles Republican Central Committee. In December 1918, as park commissioner, he made a proposal on behalf of Mayor Frederick T. Woodman that a \"gigantic monument,\" 250 feet high, be erected in Exposition Park in honor of military and naval troops who had fought in the World War just ended and that it be surmounted by a \"victory\" figure, nine feet high, to rest on a bronze ball four feet in diameter. Access would be provided by a passenger elevator. He was the attorney for and a member of the Board of Regents of the University of California. Bowen died at his home, 2033 Virginia Road, on December 22, 1937, \"the victim of pneumonia which followed a paralytic stroke.\" He was survived by his wife, Louise, and a daughter, Mrs. Mary Lorenzen."

Hemming played three matches subsequently judged to be first-class for Cambridge University in May 1848, appearing as a tail-end batsman to little effect but enjoying great success as a bowler: he took 21 wickets in his three games, including two returns of six wickets in an innings. Full statistics are not available for these games and neither his batting nor his bowling style is known. There is no record of any other cricket appearances, either in first-class or minor cricket."

  "text" : "William Skrene (c.1350-1421) was an Irish-born lawyer and judge who spent most of his adult life in England, where he became a prominent landowner and magistrate; he also served briefly as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. He was born in County Meath, to a family which derived its name from the village of Skryne, or Skreen, in that county. By his own account he endeavoured for several years to study law, but was hampered by the fact that Ireland, until the sixteenth century, had no law school. In 1380 he obtained the necessary permission to go to England to study law at Clifford's Inn. He was called to the bar and became a Serjeant-at-law in 1396. In 1394 he obtained permission to settle in England permanently, and he was also exempted from any requirement to contribute to the defence of Ireland. Nonetheless he did return to Ireland as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1395, but he seems to have served in that capacity for little more than a year before returning to England, where he remained for the rest of his life.. He acted regularly as a justice of the peace, and sat on numerous commissions for the peace, especially in Essex, where he became a major landowner, acquiring the manors of Writtle, Great Finborough and Stanford Rivers. He also had a London house in the parish of St Mary le Strand. He died in 1421. He married Alice, daughter of Sir William Rykhill, and had three children: William, his heir, who died in 1431, Thomas and Margaret. Sir John Skrene (died 1475), the younger William's grandson, was the last of the name. His death resulted in Skrene's case, which was of some importance on the law of wardship."

His change of name was the result of an arranged marriage, although the sources disagree on who his wife was. Colburn records that he married Martha, the daughter of John Praed MP, and took Praed's name on marriage.However, Cruikshanks asserts that this deal feel through, and he married Ann Slaney, the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Bristol, in a deal between Sir Humphrey Mackworth and John Praed, by which half of Ann's dowry went to redeem Praed's debt, in return for which young William Mackworth took the name of Praed and was adopted as Praed's son and heir. In 1733 he inherited from Praed the Trevethoe estate in Cornwall, which included the patronage of the parliamentary borough of St Ives, and at the 1734 general election he returned himself as Member of Parliament for St Ives. He did not stand again in 1741. William Mackworth Praed had one daughter and three sons: 1.  \n*  Humphrey Mackworth Praed, MP for St Ives 1761–68 2.  \n*  Bulkeley Mackworth Praed 3.  \n*  William Mackworth Praed"

  "text" : "Walter Blake Kirwan (1754–1805) was an Irish priest of the Church of Ireland and a noted preacher. Born in Gort, County Galway in 1754 and raised a Roman Catholic, he studied in the Jesuit school St. Omer's College, intending to study for the priesthood. Aged 17 he went to St Croix, in the West Indies, then a Danish colony, where his father's cousin was a wealthy businessman. Kirwan reportedly disagreed with slavery and did not like the climate so he returned to Europe. On the advice of his maternal uncle, the Roman Catholic Primate of Ireland, Archbishop Anthony Blake he went to the University of Louvain, completing his studies for the priesthood with distinction where he held the chair of Moral and Natural Philosophy. After leaving Louvain he went to London. In 1778 he returned to Ireland and joined the established church (Anglican) and was appointed to St. Peter's Church, Aungier Street, Dublin. He became prebend of Howth Co. Dublin, and rector of Church of St Nicholas Without, Dublin (Church of Ireland). In 1800 he was appointed Dean of Killala. Kirwan married Wilhelmina Richards on 22 September 1798. They had two sons and two daughters. He died on 27 October 1805 at his home in Mount Pleasant, Dublin. Kirwan House, an orphanage for girls, was named in his honour due to his fundraising preaching on their behalf. In 1816 a volume of his sermons was published."

  "text" : "William Walter Cargill (1813 – 23 May 1894) was a British Conservative Party politician. He was elected at a by-election in June 1863 as a Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed. His victory by a margin of 18 votes (328–310)was immediately denounced by his Liberal opponent Alexander Mitchell.Cargill's attempt at an acceptance speech was drowned out by the crowd, which hustled him as he left and broke some glass both in the Guildhall and in the inn where he was staying. Mitchell announced that he would rather be defeated than win by the means which had secured Cargill's victory, and promised that he would lodge a petition against the result. When the petition was heard before a House of Commons committee, Mitchell's lawyer produced evidence of bribery in Cargill's interest. However, when the hearing resumed on a later day he protested that the committee had not allowed him to call the witnesses he needed, and declined to offer any further evidence. The committee concluded that there was there of bribery was indirect, and that there was no proof that had been carried out on behalf of Cargill. They dismissed the petition, but noted that it was neither frivolous not vexatious. At the general election in 1865, Cargill Mitchell won the seat from Cargill. Cargill unsuccessfully contested Berwick-upon-Tweed at the 1880 genera election. At the Berwick-upon-Tweed by-election in 1881, Cargill arrived at the town and announced his intention to stand,but does not appear to have been nominated."

  "text" : "Wilhelm Sauter (born April 1, 1896 in Bruchsal, died June 27, 1948 in Göppingen) was a German painter, especially known for his war paintings. After his graduation from school he went to Heidelberg in 1913 in order to become a schoolteacher for art education. After outbreak of World War I he became a soldier in the German Infantry Regiment No. 169 in Lahr in 1915. One year later, he was deployed at the Somme near Serre. He was buried alive by an exploding artillery shell and partially lost his sense of hearing. His war experiences later became the basis for his most famous works. After a stay in the military hospital, he got employed at the Volksschule (elementary school) in Bruchsal. From 1918 to 1920 he studied at the Badische Landeskunstschule (Baden School of Arts) in Karlsruhe. Among his professors were Karl Eyth, August Groh, Walter Conz and Friedrich Fehr. After his graduation he was a schoolteacher in Villingen, Bruchsal, Karlsruhe, Weinheim and Ladenburg. At the instigation of Hans Thoma there was the first exhibition of Sauter's works at the Karlsruher Kunstverein (Karlsruhe Art Club). In the 1920s Wilhelm Sauter got married. One of his sons died of diphtheria when he was 14 years old. Wilhelm Sauter created a lot of portraits, pieces of landscape art and pictures of soldiers in different situations. He used the technique of painting as well as drawing and etching. Between 1924 and 1927 he created six drypoint illustrations to Grimmelshausen's novel Simplicius Simplicissimus. Especially his war paintings attracted the attention of the Nazis. His pictures were shown at different exhibitions, e.g. at the exhibition Heroische Kunst (Heroic Art) in Berlin in 1935, at the Badische Gaukulturschau (Baden District Culture Exhibition) in 1937, several times at the Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung (Great German Art Exhibition) in the Haus der Deutschen Kunst in Munich or at the Venice Biennale in 1942. His war paintings of this time are less dismal but more heroic than his former works. The Badisches Armeemuseum (Baden Military Museum) in Karlsruhe purchased some of Sauters works, as well as Adolf Hitler and Fritz Todt. In 1939 Wilhelm Sauter was awarded the Gaukulturpreis (District Culture Award). In 1941 he was appointed to a professor at the Hochschule der bildenden Künste (Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe) in Karlsruhe, which was the former Badische Landeskunstschule where he had studied. He worked there until 1945."

  "text" : "Wolfsindis of Reisbach is a regional saint of the Middle Ages in Lower Bavaria, who is revered as holy virgin and martyr. Her veneration dates back to the 7th or 8th century. According to legend Wolfsindis became a Christian in secret and was slain by her heathen father, whereupon a spring rose up at that spot. A different tradition recounts that, as a Christian virgin, she was bound to the tail of a horse by a rejected suitor and dragged to death. The saint and her grave were revered at least since the 8th century, when the Bavarian duke Tassilo III (748–788) gave Reisbach to Wessobrunn Abbey in 760. At this place a church synod took place in 798/799. Wolfsindis is further mentioned in a Wessobrunnian necrology from the 10th century, an indenture of Regensburg's bishop Heinrich I (1132–1155) from 1139 and a necrology of the Abbey of Saint Gall from the 12th century. Since 1753 the holy day of Wolfsindis is celebrated in Reisbach and neighbouring Dirnaich. September 2 is held to be Wolfsindis' death and feast day since old times. There are no doubts about her historicity, but there are about her martyrdom. The cult of the saint is connected to a spring cult: In the 18th and 19th century many healings were attributed to the water that nowadays flows from below the altar of the small church erected in 1822."

Apprenticed as a mechanical engineer in London from aged 15, after interview he worked with Sir Marc Isambard Brunel on the Thames Tunnel, and then designed bridges for the Calder and Hebble Navigation. Whilst surveying the route for the South Eastern Railway to Dover, he devised the more transportable dumpy level, which is now universally employed. He then supervised the northern engineering team under Isambard Kingdom Brunel on the Bristol and Exeter Railway, where the deployment of his \"curve of sines\" theorem speeded construction. Dismissed from the project in 1841, after losing money during the railway mania period, Gravatt helped to construct both the Craig telescope and a copy of the Difference machine, distinguishing himself in a number of papers submitted to the Institute of Civil Engineers. He died after being accidentally poisoned by an over dose of morphine by his nurse."

  "text" : "William John Hopkinson (November 25, 1887 - February 21, 1970) was a Canadian artist best known for his en plein air style landscapes. Born in London, England, W.J. Hopkinson studied art there briefly but was mostly self-taught. Hopkinson came to Canada in 1912. He exhibited with the Royal Canadian Academy, the Ontario Society of Artists and the Nova Scotia Society of Artists. Although his talent was well respected and he went on painting trips with many leading painters, Hopkinson never achieved the same level of recognition as some of his contemporaries. Hopkinson didn't become a full-time artist until late in life, in the late 1950s when he was in his late 60s. Hopkinson worked mainly in oils, with landscapes of forests, winter scenes and docked boats, but many pencil sketches have also survived. He painted from the 1930s until 1970, most often in the Aurora to Haliburton area of Ontario, Canada. He also painted scenes from trips to the Canadian East Coast, Alberta and British Columbia, and to Massachusetts. He also made one trip back to his home country of England, but he only painted a handful of scenes in London. Hopkinson was known to travel into the dense bush and forests in the Haliburton area and paint en plein air oil paintings on panels using palette knives, laying on thick layers of oil paint. This technique was suited to portraying the ruggedness of the landscape around him, showing fallen trees, forests and lakes under skies coloured in dramatic shades of blues, pinks and orange. The artist taught at the St. Croix School of Art, New Brunswick, and at several centres in Ontario. Hopkinson was honoured by the Ontario Society of Artists by having his painting \"Town House\" hung at the 70th annual spring exhibition being held at The Art Gallery of Toronto in 1942. The actor Vincent Price was an admirer of Hopkinson's artworks, including his paintings in The Vincent Price Collection sold by Simpson's department store in Toronto and Chicago in 1965. Price even penned birthday wishes to Hopkinson on his 80th birthday in which Price called himself as a \"longtime admirer of your beautiful paintings. Hopkinson held his first one-man show of paintings at the Main Branch of The North York Public Library in the autumn of 1966 and subsequently at other library branches of North York that year. The artist was most active in art circles in the Newmarket and Aurora area, northwest of Toronto. Hopkinson was a founder of the Newmarket Art Club, and member of the Willowdale Group of Artists and the Society of Co-operative Artists, Toronto. After his death on February 21, 1970, a retrospective exhibit and sale was held. His friend and pupil, artist Isabelle Van Zant, did a portrait for the exhibition cover."

As a student his influences included Johannes Dümichen, Adolf Michaelis and Adolf Erman. After graduation he continued his education in Paris as a student of Gaston Maspero. In 1899 he became an associate professor at Strasbourg, where in 1907 he obtained a full professorship. In 1919 he relocated to the University of Heidelberg, and four years later succeeded Friedrich Wilhelm von Bissing as chair of Egyptology at the University of Munich. Starting in 1894, he took part in excavatory work in Egypt, most notably at the Necropolis of Thebes. Around 1900 he began work at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, serving as a cataloger and editor of Demotic material. Spiegelberg made important contributions towards the deciphering of Demotic script and in the field of Demotic lexicography. During his tenure at Munich, he accompanied novelist Thomas Mann to Egypt, where he provided assistance towards the drafting of Mann's \"Joseph\" tetralogy. In 1919 he became a member of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences (a non-resident member since 1923), and from 1924, was a full member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences."

  "text" : "William Higgins was the first high constable (or high bailiff) of the Toronto Police Department. Higgins was appointed High Constable of the Home District in 1826, a position that included being inspector of police for York, Upper Canada at a salary of ₤40 a year. When the City of Toronto was incorporated in 1834, the new city council unanimously appointed Higgins High Bailiff, including the responsibility of being city inspector, with a salary of ₤125 a year while remaining High Constable (as well as the only constable) for the region. Higgins' term ended in scandal when he was implicated when he was implicated in the death of a man during election day anti-Tory rioting by largely disenfranchised Irish Catholic minority which was put down by a party of Protestant Orangemen, led by Higgins. Mayor William Lyon Mackenzie, in his role as chief magistrate, held a police court investigation and laid charges against Higgins. He was exonerated by the grand jury in April 1835 but, by that point city council had already chosen not to reappoint him. He was subsequently appointed High Constable of York County and served for many years."

He was registered as a dentist on 26 June 1906. After registration he practiced as a dentist in Wyalong, where he rode the first motorcycle and drove the first car in town. He went on to practice in Newcastle. In September 1911 Hart met Joseph Hammond who was touring Australia as a demonstration pilot for the British & Colonial Aeroplane Company. He bought (for £1,333) a Bristol Boxkite from Hammond, received some instruction from Hammond's mechanic, McDonald. A gale blew the plane, which was parked at Belmore Park, Penrith, over, and it was wrecked. Hart, with the help of friends and the mechanic, built a new aircraft, using some salvaged parts. He first flew the machine, solo, on 3 November. The next day he flew from Penrith to Parramatta with his younger brother Jack as passenger."

As a child, Pleasant was featured on national radio as part of the Major Bowles Amateur Hour. However, despite his and his family's social contributions, their status was nevertheless mitigated by the climate of racial attitudes in the Jim Crowe South. In his paintings, Pleasant sought to memorialized the local character of African-American life in Savannah amid the turmoil of the Civil Rights movement. Pleasant himself had early on become active in the movement, frequently working in collaboration with friend and fellow civil-rights leader W. W. Law. His concern for Savannah's cultural and historical legacy lead to his 1971 publication of the first Black History coloring book. He served as a member of the Savannah NAACP and a Corporal in the United States Army. Pleasant continued to work in the entertainment industry until his death in 1997, primarily as television voice-over actor."

In both 1853 and 1854 he played a single first-class cricket match for the Gentlemen of England amateur team as a middle-order batsman. His single game for Cambridge University was the 1855 University Match against Oxford University in which he top-scored in the Cambridge first innings with 45 – by some distance his own best score in major cricket – though the match was narrowly lost. He made further single appearances for the Gentlemen of England side in 1855 and 1858. Kempson joined the British Army and was a major in the 99th Regiment of Foot, where he took part in the 1860 war in China and was at the battle at the Taku Forts and the sacking of Beijing. He is recorded in the London Gazette in 1870 as transferring to the 31st Regiment of Foot with the rank of captain. He does not appear to have been related to Matthews Kempson, his near contemporary who also played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and amateur sides in the mid 1850s."

  "text" : "Wang Yuan (Chinese: 王媛; pinyin: Wáng Yuán; born April 8, 1976) is a Chinese former athlete who specialized in middle-distance running. She made her international debut at the 1993 World Championships in Athletics, failing to progress beyond the heats. On September 8, 1993, while still a 17-year-old, she set the world youth best in the 800 metres at 1:57.18 minutes while qualifying for the final at the Chinese national games. That meet has been an anomaly amongst athletics records due to the freakish string of records set by Chinese women during the meet. The following day, Wang ran 1:58.16 to finish fifth in the final behind the still standing Asian record 1:55.54 set by Liu Dong (who had won the World Championship a month earlier). Two days after that, Wang ran in the 1500 metres final, finishing in seventh place, but again her time of 3:59.81 was another world youth best, bettering the record of 4:01.79 she had set in qualifying. In two races, Wang took more than six seconds out of the previous record. That race was won by Qu Yunxia (who had won the 3000 metres at the world championships a month earlier), in a still standing world record of 3:50.46. Ahead of her in that race was also Wang Junxia (the world champion at 10,000 metres a month earlier) running the second fastest time to that point in time. Wang Junxia also set world records in the 3000 and 10000 at that meet. In all, eleven Asian records were set in that one meet by the Chinese women, three of them were world records. More than two decades later, six Asian records survive and all three of the world records. For the records that were surpassed and the closest challenge to the ones who survived came at the same meet four years later. Yet none of the athletes from the 1993 meeting repeated in 1997. Even though most of the women were in their teens or early 20's, only Wang Junxia made it to the 1996 Olympics (where she picked up a gold and silver medal). Wang and virtually all the others disappeared and never produced notable results after 1994. Most of the distance runners were coached by Ma Junren who was suspected of doping his athletes. While charges were never brought against Ma, Wang Junxia dropped him as her coach before she went to the Olympics. Six of his athletes failed blood tests. But it was Ma Junren's group of women who in 1997 produced Jiang Bo setting the world record in the 5000 metres and just missing Qu Yunxia's world record in the 1500, Dong Yanmei chasing Bo to the record, Li Jing setting the still standing Youth best at 400 metres and Lang Yinglai setting the still standing world junior record in the 1500. Just behind Yinglai was Zhang Ling who took more than four seconds off Wang's record in qualifying and another in the final to take the record to 3:54.52. Also in 1997, Na Lin equalled Wang's 1:58.16 as the second best performance ever, but Wang's Youth best still stands, and Lin was the only girl to come within two seconds of the mark."

  "text" : "William Ward Claypon Lane (1 August 1845 – 31 March 1939) was an English banker and a cricketer who played in a few first-class cricket matches for Cambridge University and Surrey between 1866 and 1870. He was born at Kennington, at the time of his birth part of Surrey, now an inner London suburb, and he died at Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire. From 1877, he adopted the name \"Lane-Claypon\". Lane was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He played cricket as a lower-order right-hand batsman and a right-arm slow round-arm bowler in single first-class matches for Cambridge University in both 1866 and 1867, and then against the university for Southgate Cricket Club in 1868, all without success. He made 36 and 11 playing for Surrey against Oxford University also in 1868, but played only one further first-class match, a second game for Surrey in 1870 in which he was again not successful. His brother Charlton had a much longer first-class cricket career for Surrey, Oxford University and various amateur sides. After leaving Cambridge, Lane moved to Lincolnshire where he was involved in a bank at Boston and became a Justice of the Peace. He is recorded as \"of Aswardby Hall, Spilsby\". Later he moved back to the London area and was a warden of the Worshipful Company of Mercers and involved with the livery company's educational charities; he was Master of the company in 1899. He was a director of the Capital and Counties Bank."

  "text" : "William Wirt Virgin (September 18, 1823 – January 23, 1893) was an American politician and jurist from Maine. Virgin was born in 1823 in Rumford, Maine and graduated from Bowdoin College in 1844. He was admitted to the Maine bar in 1847 and moved to Norway, Maine, where practiced law until 1871. During the American Civil War, Virgin raised the 23rd Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, which consisted of five companies from Oxford County and Androscoggin Counties. The Regiment did not see combat, instead acting as a guard of Washington D.C. Virgin, a Republican, served two one-year terms in the Maine Senate (1865, 1866). In his 2nd and final term, Virgin served as the Senate President. In 1872, Virgin was appointed to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court as an Associate Justice. He served in that position until his death on January 23, 1893."

He is remembered as a narrator of Low German legends and fairy tales. He took classical studies at the Universities of Kiel and Leipzig, obtaining his doctorate in 1869 with a thesis on the ancient poet Tibullus, \"Quaestiones Tibullianae\".Beginning in 1877, he taught classes at the Mariengymnasium in Jever. From 1887 to 1902, he was a senior instructor in Eutin, afterwards teaching classes at the gymnasium in Oldenburg (1902–1908). While working as a schoolteacher in Eutin and Oldenburg, he compiled Low German fairy tales by conducting interviews with numerous individuals. From 1898 to 1909, he interviewed in the region between the cities of Fehmarn and Lübeck, approximately 230 men and women, mostly elderly and rural persons, who still had recollections of the old tales. These stories were then edited and published by Wisser. Today he is commemorated by a thoroughfare in Lübeck, (Wilhelm-Wisser-Weg) and by a junior high school in Eutin (Wilhelm-Wisser-Realschule)."

Called \"one of the seminal figures in gay publishing\" by the San Francisco Sentinel, he was originally ordained a Catholic priest and later graduated from UCLA. He worked for the Los Angeles Times and Gay Sunshine, serving as editor for the latter when it was rebranded as the Gay Sunshine Journal. Under his direction, the Journal was praised by Allen Ginsberg for \"its presentation of literary history hitherto kept in the closet by the academies.\" In 1975, Leyland founded Gay Sunshine Press, the oldest LGBT publishing house in the United States, followed by Leyland Publications in 1984. The two imprints combined have published more than 135 books, and are known for their translations of gay-themed European and Asian literature into English, including works by Vladimir Makanin, Yukio Mishima, and Nikolai Gogol. Leyland won the Stonewall Book Award in 1980 for his work as editor of Now the Volcano: An Anthology of Latin American Gay Literature. He was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and won it in 1992."

  "text" : "William Martin Leake (23 April 1831 – 25 August 1918) was an English civil engineer and industrialist and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, the Marylebone Cricket Club and other amateur sides in the 1850s. He was born at Marylebone in London and died at Newnham on Severn, Gloucestershire. Educated at Rugby School and St John's College, Cambridge, Leake was placed 24th in the list of Wranglers in 1854. As a cricketer, he played as a batsman, sometimes opening the innings but more often in the middle order; it is not known if he was right-handed or left-handed. His figures are not impressive by modern standards, but he retained his place in the Cambridge team across four summers and appeared four times, from 1851 to 1854, in the annual University match against Oxford. His best innings came in his first appearance in this fixture in 1851, when he opened the batting and made a score of 66, which was the highest innings of the match. After graduating from Cambridge he played one game for a \"Gentlemen of England\" side in the summer of 1854 and once for MCC in 1858. After graduating, Leake appears to have gone to Sri Lanka, then called \"Ceylon\", as a civil engineer but then to have become involved in the introduction tea and cinnamon as crops on the island. By 1873, he had returned to England and was manager of a cement works at Blackwall in London, and he is recorded as such in the 1881 England and Wales census, when he was living in West Dulwich. He retained interests in Sri Lankan tea plantations and as late as 1898 he was representing \"tea interests\" in Ceylon to a committee debating future currency arrangements for India."

  "text" : "William Dunkel (born New Jersey 26 March 1893, died Kilchberg, ZH 10 September 1980) was a Swiss architect and painter. He worked in Germany until 1929 when he relocated to Switzerland upon obtaining a teaching job at the ETH (technical university) in Zürich. Dunkel was born in 1893 in the US. His parents, Jacob Dunkel and Berta Marie Kruse/Dunkel were nevertheless Swiss, and William did his growing up in Buenos Aires and Lausanne. In 1912 he started to study architecture in Germany at the Dresden University of Technology. He received his doctorate from Dresden in 1917 from Cornelius Gurlitt, for a dissertation entitled \"Beiträge zur Entwicklung des Städtebaues in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika\" (\"Contributions to the development of town planning in America\") Because of the dire state of the economy, Dunkel's first work after the First World War was not as an architect but as an advertisement artist in Düsseldorf. At this time he was able to network with other artists such as Paul Klee, Otto Dix, Max Liebermann and Oskar Kokoschka. As an artist Dunkel would in the end leave behind him a very substantial body of work. In 1923 Dunkel opened his own architecture practice in Düsseldorf. Winning some competitive tenders and prizes, he was able to draw attention to himself. In 1926 he married Emita Gschwind. His appointment to a teaching post at the ETH (technical university) in Zürich followed in 1929. Here his students would include Max Frisch, Alberto Camenzind, Justus Dahinden and Jakob Zweifel. Like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, William Dunkel was a representative of the Neues Bauen school of architecture (sometimes translated in English as the New Objectivity school, although broadly agreed definitions of who represented which architectural movement are hard to find in either of the respective languages). The style was much used in twentieth century Switzerland. Among the better known of Dunkel's contributions are the Orion Auto-factory (1929) in Zürich and his own home in the city's Kilchberg quarter (1932). Nevertheless, two of his firm's most ambitious designs for public buildings remained unbuilt because they were rejected in cantonal referendums: the 60,000 seat \"Oktogon stadium\" (1953, actually designed by Dunkel's assistant, Justus Dahinden) and a new city theatre (1961) for Zürich, inspired by Alvar Aalto's theatre in Essen. William Dunkel died on 10 September 1980 in Kilchberg, Zürich."

  "text" : "Willem van Genk (Born April 2, 1927 in Voorburg; died May 12, 2005 in The Hague) was a Dutch painter and graphic artist, celebrated as one of the leading masters of Outsider Art. Throughout his life he suffered from severe mental distress, experiencing symptoms related to autism and schizophrenia. On account of his passion for trains, buses, and train stations, he called himself the \"King of Stations\". Van Genk’s panoramic cityscapes and fragmented collages express his feelings about modern authority, feelings which were shaped by an abusive father who, in addition to administering his own beatings, left him exposed to a traumatic experience at the hands of the Gestapo during the German occupation of the Netherlands in the Second World War. Van Genk’s art has been widely exhibited in Europe, where it is also in many museum collections, including those of the Stedelijk Museum, the Dr. Guislain Museum in Ghent, the Collection de l’Art Brut in Lausanne, the Lille Metropole Musee d’Art Modern, d’Art Contemporain et d’Art Brut (LaM), the Croatian Museum of Naïve Art in Zagreb,and the Museum of Everything in London.Raw Vision, the leading magazine covering Art Brut, ranks van Genk among the “masters of outsider art.” At the beginning of 2005, which would later prove the year of the artist’s death, van Genk’s Keleti Station, now in the collection of the Museum of Everything in London, sold for a hundred thousand dollars at New York’s Outsider Art Fair, thus setting the record for most expensive work ever sold by a living outsider artist. On that occasion, Roberta Smith, the chief art critic of The New York Times, praised the piece “as the leading candidate for best in show.”  At least one other critic has identified van Genk as the most important Dutch outsider artist. Van Genk’s first major American exhibition is scheduled for Autumn 2014 at the American Folk Art Museum in New York City. Willem van Genk: Mind Traffic, the first solo exhibition of the artist in the United States, is presented during the fall of 2014 at the American Folk Art Museum in New York City. It “focuses on his creative process, his recurring themes, and the diverseness of his aesthetic,” providing, as curators Patrick Allegaert, Yoon Hee Lamot, and Dr. Valérie Rousseau noted, a chronological overview of his oeuvre and a comprehensive understanding of van Genk’s mindset. To complement the presentation of his major artworks, Mind Traffic “includes a selection of documents and objects from van Genk’s living environment: an accumulation of favorite books from his library, handmade maps, personal notes, and his collection of raincoats.” In their published statement, the curators proposed an original perspective: “The artworks can be seen as memory palaces,” as they “depict intricately layered and densely networked urban panoramas and reference interconnectivity.”"

He was born in Barrie, Ontario, studied medicine at the University of Toronto and interned at The Hospital for Sick Children and the Toronto General Hospital. Gallie spent one year at the Hospital for the Ruptured and Crippled in New York City in 1905. He returned to Toronto the following year and joined the Hospital for Sick Children as an orthopaedic surgeon. From 1907 to 1910, he worked as a junior surgeon at Toronto General before returning to the Hospital for Sick Children. In 1921, he became chief surgeon at the Hospital for Sick Children and, in 1928, became a professor of surgery and chief surgeon at Toronto General. He established a training course for residents in surgery that would qualify them to take examinations with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. In 1941, he was named president of the American College of Surgeons. He retired from general surgery in 1947. In 1951, he convinced Samuel McLaughlin to create a foundation that would fund post-graduate studies for potential teachers for Canadian medical schools. Gallie died of squamous-cell carcinoma at the age of 77. He was named to the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame in 2001."

  "text" : "Captain William Stratton Prince (died 1881) was a British Army officer, Chief Constable of Toronto (1859–1873) and the first warden of the Toronto Central Prison (1873-1881). As chief, Prince oversaw the militarization of the Toronto police. Prince was the son of Colonel John Prince, an English barrister who emigrated to Canada in 1833 and became a member of the legislative assembly, a colonel in the militia, businessman and ultimately a judge. William Prince enlisted in the British Army in 1837 and rose to the rank of Captain. He fought in the Crimean War in 1854, returned to Canada in 1856 and was appointed Chief Constable of the Toronto Police Department in 1859. Prince's predecessor, Samuel Sherwood, was fired along with the entire police force as the result of lack of discipline, corruption and rioting. Half of the police force was re-hired, most of them younger recruits. Under Prince, the police were organized under military discipline to the extent that unmarried constables were required to be housed in special barracks and needed approval to marry. In 1872, Prince introduced a timed beat system in which officers were to follow minute by minute schedules when walking their beat. The police force of 60 threatened to go on strike and were fired as a result. When officers asked for their jobs back, 18 were refused. Police were required to participate in drills three times a week but were also required to be moderate in their use of force in contrast to abuses that had occurred previously. Prince resigned as chief constable in 1873 in order to become the first warden of the new Toronto Central Prison at King and Strachan Streets. Imposing military discipline, the prison became known for its brutality with stories of prisoners being beaten to death and buried on the prison grounds. In 1880, Prince ordered that an American prisoner be flogged nearly to death. The American embassy in Ottawa complained and the Attorney-General of Ontario ordered, in 1881, that the brutality stop and that flogging not occur without his permission. Prince resigned the same month and took a position as registrar of Wellington County. He died in 1882 of alcoholism."

  "text" : "(For the Oxford University and Kent cricketer, see William Patterson (cricketer, born 1859).) William Seeds Patterson (19 March 1854 – 20 October 1939) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, Lancashire and various amateur teams between 1874 and 1882. He was born at Mossley Hill, Liverpool and died at Hook Heath, Woking, Surrey. Patterson was educated at Uppingham School, where he was captain of the cricket eleven and was coached by the famous cricketer H. H. Stephenson, and Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed middle order batsman and a right-arm slow bowler. At Cambridge, he made an early impression as a batsman by scoring 147 in the freshmen's trial match of 1874. That brought him into the university first eleven for much of the summer, playing largely as a batsman, often opening the innings, and he scored 86 in his third game, the home match against Surrey. But he lost form and was not in the side for the 1874 University Match against Oxford University; he was also not successful in a couple of matches for Lancashire later in the season. Greater use was made in 1875 of Patterson's bowling, and he was also more consistent as a batsman, playing as a middle- or lower-order batsman; in the University Match, he took three Oxford wickets in each innings and scored 12 and 18, but Cambridge lost the match by just six runs. There was further improvement in both batting and bowling in 1876. Against the Gentlemen of England side, in a 12-a-side match, he took 11 wickets in the match with 7 for 64 in the first innings. In the 1876 University Match, Patterson shared the first-innings wickets with his Uppingham School fast-bowling colleague, Henry Luddington, taking five for 42, and then scored an unbeaten 105 in the Cambridge innings, for less than a day the highest innings in the University Match series – Oxford's captain William Game scored 109 in his second innings – and the only century of Patterson's first-class career. He was then picked for the Gentlemen side in the Gentlemen v Players match at Prince's Cricket Ground, where he took seven wickets (though W. G. Grace took 10). By the end of the season, in only eight first-class games, Patterson had taken 52 wickets. Patterson was one of the leading bowlers of the 1877 season, taking 80 wickets in 11 first-class games. He was captain of the Cambridge University team and again shared Oxford's first-innings wickets with Luddington in the University Match, though an innings of 117 not out by Francis Buckland won the game easily for Oxford. There were five players from Uppingham School in the Cambridge team under Patterson, all of whom had been coached by Stephenson: The Times in its obituary of Patterson in 1939 wrote that, though Eton, Harrow or Winchester might have supplied this number of cricketers to a university team in the early days of the University Match, \"since the game became more generally known and played by the public schools, this record has not been equalled\". At the end of the Cambridge term, Patterson played twice in Gentlemen v Players matches. In the second of these, at Lord's, he took seven Players' wickets for 58 runs in the first innings and then, batting at No 11 in a very strong batting line-up, joined Fred Grace with nine Gentlemen wickets down for 97 runs and a further 46 required for victory: Grace scored 23 and Patterson 24, both not out, to secure the win \"amid great applause\". After graduating from Cambridge in 1877, Patterson went into business and had little time for cricket; he later served on the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. He played a few matches for Lancashire in 1877, 1878 and 1882, a couple in Philadelphia in 1880 and 1881 and one for Liverpool and District in 1882; thereafter there were minor matches in Liverpool and in the United States up to 1888. In later life, he wrote a history of cricket at Uppingham School."

Lyon was educated at a private school called Highstead in Torquay, Devon and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he played in six first-class matches over three seasons, five for Cambridge University and one for a \"Gentlemen of the North\" side for whom he made his highest score of 22. His Cambridge matches included the 1861 University Match against Oxford University; batting in the lower order, he made 15 and 16 as Cambridge won the match by 133 runs. He did not appear in the University Matches with Oxford in 1862 and 1863. He played a lot of amateur non-first-class cricket for teams such as Free Foresters through to the 1880s and beyond. Lyon graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1864. The following year, he and his younger brother Charles moved to Tutbury to take over the cotton mill previously owned by their uncle, Charles Webb. The cotton mill was transferred to Rocester in 1888, after which the mill in Tutbury was used for grinding locally mined gypsum. Tutbury being sited on the county boundary, Lyon was a Justice of the Peace for both Staffordshire and Derbyshire."

  "text" : "William Augustus Mackworth (3 March 1825 – 4 December 1855) was a Trinidad-born English cricketer who played one first-class cricket match for Cambridge University in 1845 and another for Manchester in 1848. He was born in Trinidad where his father was high sheriff and died at St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia. Mackworth matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1844 but it is not recorded if he took a degree. He married in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1852. In January 1855, he was named as one of the founding \"resident members\" of the new Melbourne branch of Miles and Kington, a Bristol-based company of \"General Agents and Commission Merchants\", alongside Philip Oliphant Kington, who later played first-class cricket for Victoria. His death at the end of 1855 came \"after an illness of ten days\". As a cricketer, Mackworth was a middle-order batsman; there is no record that he bowled nor is it known whether he was right- or left-handed. He achieved little in his one game for Cambridge University, but not out innings of 10 and 28 in the 1848 first-class match between Manchester and Sheffield – a forerunner of Lancashire and Yorkshire matches – enabled Manchester to win by 11 runs. He appeared for Manchester in minor matches in both 1847 and 1848."

  "text" : "Wirydianna Fiszerowa (born Wirydianna Radolińska, using the Leszczyc coat of arms, later Wirydianna Kwilecka) (1761 in Wyszyny - 1826 in Działyń) was a Polish noblewoman best known for her memoirs, which mention her life in pre- and post-partition Poland as well as her relations with prominent people of the time, including King Frederick II of Prussia, Izabela Czartoryska, King Stanisław II Augustus, Józef Poniatowski, Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, and Tadeusz Kościuszko, whom she adored. Events which she lived through include the Bar Confederation, which caused local upheaval, the work of the Great Sejm, Kościuszko Uprising, and the Napoleonic Wars. She was the eldest daughter of Katarzyna Raczyńska, popular in Wielkopolska and Józef Radoliński (d. 1781), with sisters: Katarzyna (b.1762) and Antonina (b.1770). She was named for her material grandmother Wirydianna Bnińska (1718–1797). At the age of 25, she married Antoni Kwilecki, the son of Franciszek Antoni Kwilecki having chosen him over an older man, fearing that otherwise she would have become his nursemaid. They had two children: Anna (called Nina) (b.1789) and Józef (b. 1791). The marriage was not particularly happy, mostly because of his alcoholism which at times made him turn violent (Wirydianna nearly miscarried her daughter Anna after he hit her), and the hostility of his parents. However, he did defend her against them, though Wirydianna credited this less to the love he held for her, than to the family custom of fighting. When he fell for a fourteen-year-old peasant girl, he divorced Wirydianna. He was an envoy at the Four-Year Sejm, and she wrote speeches for her him and her cousins. In 1806 she married Stanisław Fiszer, a general who fought with Napoleon in his campaign against Russia, who loved her, though for Wirydianna this was more about rewarding him for his patriotic service and to bring herself closer to Kościuszko, who cared for Fiszer. Personally she was witty, called the \"Voltaire in skirts\", and spoke of her fellow citizens as \"always brave and always beaten\", believing that if they had banded together, they could have defended themselves from foreign aggression and prevented the partitions (this views is not shared by most modern historians. While living on a widow's pension in Warsaw after the formation of the Congress Kingdom, her mocking jokes about Grand Duke Constantine, the viceroy, reached his ears, and she received from him a threatening letter through his adjutant. She remained calm, saying only \"Voilà une lettre qui passera à postérité\" (This is a letter which will pass on to history), at which said adjutant left, having taken back the later which was to be the source of more amusement for her in the coming weeks. She wrote in French; the memoirs were only published in a Polish translation in 1975 by Edward Raczyński, a kinsman who had been the Polish President in exile. In the meantime, it was widely unknown by historians, though mentioned in the pre-war Polish Biographical Dictionary with an entry by Adam Mieczysław Skałkowski, who knew only the year of her death."

  "text" : "Captain Wilbur \"Will\" Greene (ca 1931 - 28 April 1972) was from a small town in South Carolina. Greene first served commendably in the U.S. Special Forces, learning Vietnamese while serving in the Vietnam War. He retired after 20 years to begin a new paramilitary career with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). After joining the CIA's Directorate of Operations in 1967, he underwent training before deploying overseas in March 1968. Soon after, his wife died in an auto accident. Greene returned to the U.S. and arranged care for his young orphaned children before returning overseas to his assignment. Known by his call sign \"Black Lion,\" Green remained in the most dangerous forward Hmong outposts even when ordered to evacuate. From there he directed Hmong troops in heavy combat. In one instance, on 2 December 1969, Green rallied pro-American guerrillas retreating from a communist attack on Phou Nok Kok by his direction of close air support. In another, on 4 April 1970, Greene led 3 Special Guerrilla Unit in the counterattack that prevented the North Vietnamese aggressors of Campaign 139 from overrunning Long Tieng, the main base of General Vang Pao's guerrilla army on the Plain of Jars. Greene served twice as the CIA's Chief of Paramilitary Operations before dying on the table during a gall bladder operation at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base on 28 April 1972. The Operation Black Lion offenses that began in Laos on 18 June 1972 bore his call sign. His CIA superiors praised his \"...exceptionally strong leadership and organizational skills, extensive military experiences, perseverance under harsh conditions, and ability to train others...\" In 2008, Green was recognized for his outstanding leadership as a Paramilitary Case Officer by the officers of the Special Activities Division during a ceremony at CIA Headquarters as part of a Black History Month commemoration."

He was born in Islington, London and died at Kolkata, then named Calcutta, in India. Maples was educated at Winchester College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1838. He played cricket both at school and at Cambridge, and appeared as a lower-order batsman in one match that has been judged to have been first-class, the 1839 University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford University, scoring one run and taking one catch. Maples appears not to have taken a degree at Cambridge University; in 1840 he entered the Honourable East India Company's service and in 1843 he was recorded as assistant to the Accountant General in Bengal. In the report of The Times of his marriage to Henrietta Westmacott at Calcutta in 1844, he is described as \"second son of T. F. Maples, Esq., of Crouch-end, Hornsey\". The marriage produced at least one son, Frederick George, who was educated at Highgate School and St John's College, Cambridge and became a Roman Catholic priest."

He was educated at Warwick School and at Tonbridge School and matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1851, though the record indicates (perhaps mistakenly) that he did not achieve his Bachelor of Laws degree until 1871. As a cricketer, he played in four major matches for Cambridge University in 1853 as a lower-order batsman and a bowler, though it is not known what his batting or bowling style was; these games included the 1853 University Match against Oxford University in which he scored 7 and 14 not out (his highest first-class score) and took three wickets. In 1854, he played a single match for a Gentlemen of Kent side against the Gentlemen of England, but he is not recorded in any further games. Maule was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England in Bombay in 1856 and as a priest in 1859; he was first a chaplain at Nellore in southern India and then at Colaba, near Bombay. From 1872 to 1879 he was successively archdeacon and commissary at Bombay and then senior chaplain at St. Thomas Cathedral, Mumbai. He later settled at Boulogne in France where he was British chaplain and where he died in 1913."

  "text" : "William Leigh Mellish (11 June 1813 – 18 April 1864) was an English soldier, landowner and cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University in 1832. He was born in East Tuddenham, Norfolk and died at Hodsock Priory, near Worksop, Nottinghamshire. Mellish was the elder son of the Rev. Edward Mellish, rector of East Tuddenham and later Dean of Hereford and his wife, who was Elizabeth Jane Leigh. George Mellish, a noted mid-Victorian barrister and judge, was his younger brother. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge University, he appeared in two first-class cricket matches for the university side, both of them against the Cambridge Town Club; in one, he opened the batting, in the other he played as a tail-end batsman. Mellish left Cambridge without taking a degree; in 1833 he became an officer in the British Army: he is recorded as a second lieutenant in 1833 and as a captain in 1842, but he sold his commission in 1846 and left the full-time army. Thereafter he served with the local Nottinghamshire militia and at his death in 1864 he was recorded as \"Lieutenant-Colonel of the Royal Sherwood Foresters\". In 1855, he inherited Hodsock Priory, which had been held by the Mellish family since the 17th century, from his cousin Anne Chambers, née Mellish. Upon his death, his son Henry Mellish inherited Hodsock Priory."

  "text" : "William Gagan (born April 5, 1981) is an American photojournalist from San Francisco, CA. He attended Redwood High School (Larkspur, California) and graduated in 1999. He then went on to pursue a bachelor's degree in Communications at Dominican University of California which he received in 2003. In September 2011 he joined the Occupy Wall Street movement as a live streamer and journalist embedded within the movement. He made his entrance into the public spotlight when he snuck into Syria over the border of Turkey on a fact-finding mission in early 2012. Despite his success crossing into Syria and traveling with the Free Syrian Army he received much criticism and praise alike for his mission. Gagan primarily reports using social media and technology, but has since moved to photography and videography working for organizations such as Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in 2012–13 as a member of Operation Zero Tolerance, filming the TV show Whale Wars for Animal Planet. He also worked as a videographer in North Africa with H.A.R.P., better known as the Humanitarian Aid & Rescue Project in 2012. While in South Sudan specifically he worked for H.A.R.P. and also as a consultant with Minetech International who are contracted by the United Nations as a Mine clearance agency there. In 2014 he travelled to Southeast Asia where he worked as a freelance photographer on the island of Koh Tao."

  "text" : "William Wagner (1796–1885) was a gentleman scientist, philanthropist, and Philadelphia merchant who is most well known for founding the Wagner Free Institute of Science. From a young age, he aspired to be a scientist. However, in 1814, he went to work for Stephen Girardas a counting house clerk. But his love for the natural sciences persisted, and in 1815, he became a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. During this time, was greatly influenced by Stephen Girard's philanthropic efforts, particularly his posthumous founding of Girard College. Though Wagner's wealth was merely a small fraction of Girard's, he aimed to benefit the Philadelphia community as well. After his marriage to his second wife, Louisa Binney, Wagner was inspired to found the Wagner Free Institute of Science where he offered a view of his varied specimens collection as well as free lectures for all people on scientific topics. During he and Louisa's two month honeymoon across Europe, they visited various natural history museums including the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. Wagner found that he often had to provide a reference to view many of the museums in Europe. Though he had no trouble providing such a reference, Wagner considered this concept unfair and sought to create a natural sciences museum that would be for all people regardless of gender or financial means. The building was erect in 1865, and Wagner remained active with the Institute until his death in 1885 at the age of 89. The board of directors then passed on the directorship to noted Philadelphia scientist and Academy member Joseph Leidy"

Weston was known for his research in the fungal group known as the phycomycetes, particularly the pathogenic genus Sclerospora. His nickname was \"Cap\", an insider joke among mycologists referring to the cap the fruit body of fungi, or mushroom. He received a BA from Dartmouth College in 1911, then received his MA in 1912 and PhD (under the supervision of Roland Thaxter) in 1915, both from Harvard University. He worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and at Western Reserve University, then became assistant professor of botany, professor of cryptogamic botany, and chairman of the botany department, all at Harvard. In 1962, he received the Civilian Distinguished Service Award from the United States Army for his work as a civilian consulting for the Quartermaster Corps. He was elected to fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1979, the Mycological Society of America established the William H. Weston Award for Excellence in Teaching in his honor. The award is given each year to an outstanding undergraduate or graduate level teacher of mycology. Species named after Weston include Helicoma westonii and Septobasidium westonii. The standard author abbreviation W.Weston is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "The Reverend Walter Baptist Money (27 July 1848 – 1 March 1924) was an English clergyman and cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, Kent, Surrey, the Gentlemen and several other amateur sides between 1867 and 1871. He was born at Sternfield, Suffolk and died at Edgbaston, Birmingham. Money was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, Money was a right-handed middle-order batsman and a slow left-arm bowler. He was in the first team at Harrow for three seasons from 1865 to 1867 and \"was perhaps even more famous at school for his lob bowling than for his batting\". He played first-class cricket as an 18-year-old for the Gentlemen of Kent against the Marylebone Cricket Club in a 12-a-side match in 1866 and took five wickets in the first MCC innings and top-scored with 36 when the Kent side batted. The following season he played a single first-class match for the Kent County Cricket Club. From 1868 to 1871 he was at Cambridge University and he played in the University Match against Oxford University in all four seasons, captaining the team in 1870. Money's personal contribution to this game was not great, but it was a sensational game, known widely as \"Cobden's Match\" on account of the feat of the Cambridge bowler Frank Cobden, who, with Oxford requiring three runs to win, took the last three wickets in three balls, a hat-trick, to win the match for Cambridge. Money had had his own personal triumph in the University Match of the previous year, 1869, when his bowling figures of six for 24 and five for 35 were instrumental in another Cambridge victory. Those were the best bowling figures of his first-class career, but though his bowling fell away in 1870 his batting developed and he scored the only two centuries of his career in that season. The higher was an innings of 134 against Surrey, for whom he had played in a couple of games in the 1869 season. A more prominent innings was his unbeaten 109, following a first-innings top score of 70, for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval; W. G. Grace, just nine days older than Money, made 215 in the same second innings. Where Grace went on in first-class cricket for a further 38 years, however, Money played only four further matches, three of them for Cambridge University in 1871; the University Match that year was his last first-class game and he was twice a victim of Samuel Butler, who took all 10 wickets in Cambridge's first innings and 15 in the match. Money left Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1871 and was ordained as a clergyman in the Church of England, serving first as a curate at Bakewell, Derbyshire and then at Drigg with Irton in Cumberland. From 1875 he was curate and then, from 1882, rector at Weybridge, Surrey, but he retired from there in 1902 and was later living in Birmingham. In 1920, he produced a book, Humours of a Parish, and other Quaintnesses, from his clerical experiences."

In 2002 she ranked in the top five over both walk distance at the national championships. Her first major international competition was the 2002 Asian Games in Busan. There she entered the women's 20 km walk final and won the gold medal with a time of 1:33:40 hours. Her time was also the fastest ever recorded in South Korea – an achievement which stood until the 2013 World Championships in Athletics was contested in Daegu nine years later. In spite of her winning the major regional title while still a teenager, this outing proved to be the last major race of her career and she subsequently retired from competition."

His residential projects illustrated simplicity of form, natural light, and large windows displaying a smooth connection between interior and exterior. Cody maintained a diverse practice in the Coachella Valley of California. His work included designing country clubs, residences, hotels, a library, and church projects in Palm Springs, Indian Wells, Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, and in southern California, Arizona, Mexico, and Cuba."

  "text" : "William Miskey Singerly (December 27, 1832 - February 27, 1898) was a Philadelphia businessman and newspaper publisher. Singerly was born in Philadelphia in 1832. His father Joseph Singerly was instrumental in the creation of the city's street car system. Singerly graduated from high school in 1850 and worked in a produce commission house. He then worked with his father in the street car business and spent some time in that field in Chicago. Singerly purchased the small The Philadelphia Record newspaper in 1877 with a circulation of about 5,000 daily, and transformed it into a large circulation one-cent daily. By 1894, it had a circulation over 160,000. He was also involved in real estate development, overseeing the building of over 1,000 new homes. A staunch Democrat, he ran for Pennsylvania governor in 1894 but was defeated by Daniel H. Hastings. After suffering significant financial difficulties including the failure of the Chestnut Street National Bank (of which he was president) in December 1897, Singerly died in February 1898. He was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia."

  "text" : "William Jesse Oliver (January 13, 1867 – March 28, 1925) was an American industrialist who operated one of the nation's most successful contracting firms in the early 20th century. He built several hundred miles of railroad in the Southern Appalachian region during the 1890s and early 1900s, and opened the South's largest privately owned manufacturing plant in 1905. He submitted the initial winning bid for the construction of the Panama Canal in 1907, though the bid was eventually rejected. Along with industrial endeavors, Oliver was engaged in civic and political affairs in his adopted hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee. He made national headlines in 1908 when he seized control of the Tennessee Republican Party convention, and had himself and several supporters elected to various party positions. He served as president of Knoxville's Appalachian Exposition in 1910."

  "text" : "William Kirkpatrick of Ellisland and Shaws (1705–1777) was a Scottish lawyer, academic and politician. He was born at Closeburn Castle, the third son of Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick, 2nd Baronet of Closeburn, and Dame Isobell Lockhart. His father died before William and his older brother Thomas (later 3rd Baronet of Closeburn) turned 18, which led to local gentleman and future MP Charles Areskine (Erskine), Lord Tinwald overseeing the end of their formal education. It is likely he encouraged William to read law and attend Leiden University in the Netherlands. William married Areskine's daughter Jean Erskine, 21 years his junior, on 21 December 1746  in Edinburgh, and they had at least five children. Jean died in childbirth aged just 26 on 23 September 1752. Once qualified in law, William held the post of Regius Professor of the Law of Nature and Nations at Edinburgh from 2 December 1734 to May 1735, replacing Areskine who had stepped aside for him. When in 1735 he resigned from that role, it was to contest the by-election for his father-in-law’s Dumfries Burghs seat in the House of Commons after Areskine won both it and Dumfriesshire in the 1734 election. There then followed a protracted dispute over a double return (where the returning officer declares both pairs of candidates to be elected, leaving the House of Commons to make the decision) of that bi-election, the result of which was that William did not take his seat until 13 February 1736. He served as Member of Parliament until 1738, at which point he became Clerk of Session at the Court of Session. William died on 17 October 1777 at Shaws House, Dumfriesshire aged 72. Among his grandsons were the noted antiquary and artist Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe and his older brother General Matthew Sharpe, who followed in the footsteps of both Areskine and Kirkpatrick by serving as Member of Parliament for Dumfries Burghs, albeit 100 years later."

  "text" : "William Cyril Newcome (1813 – 19 March 1897) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played in a single match for Cambridge University in 1836 that has since been judged to have been first-class. He was born at Litcham, Norfolk and died at Feltwell Hall, also in Norfolk. The precise date of his birth is not known, but he was baptised at Litcham on 19 October 1813; his second name is spelled as \"Cyrill\" in the baptismal record. Newcome was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He appeared as an opening batsman in a trial match for the university cricket at Cambridge in 1836 and, though not successful, was picked for the team to play the Marylebone Cricket Club, where he batted at No 10 and scored 7 in his only innings. It is not known whether he batted right- or left-handed; full bowling figures for his single first-class match are not available, but there is no sign from that game nor from later minor matches played by Newcome that he bowled. Among minor matches in which he featured later were games played against the All-England Eleven by a 22-strong side representing Lincolnshire. Newcome graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1837, upgrading to a Master of Arts in 1843. He was ordained as a Church of England priest and became curate at Hanslope in Buckinghamshire until 1846, when he was appointed rector of Boothby Pagnell in Lincolnshire. He remained there for 50 years, retiring in late 1896 to his house at Feltwell where he died a few months later. Aside from cricket, Newcome had other sporting interests, including fishing and hawking, but especially hunting: \"He followed it with unremitting zest (though never allowing it to interfere with his clerical duties), through the long term of his residence at Boothby, with the Belvoir and other packs in the neighbourhood, no day being too long or distance too far for him.\""
