  "text" : "Yin Xiuzhen (Chinese: 尹秀珍; born 1963 in Beijing) is a Chinese sculpture and installation artist. She incorporates used textiles and keepsakes from her childhood in Beijing to show the connection between memory and cultural identity. She studied painting in the Fine Arts Department of Capital Normal University, Beijing from 1985-89. After graduation, Yin taught at the high school attached to the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, until her exhibition schedule became too demanding. In 1989 she was first exposed to installation art; she showed her first installation, Door, in the studio of artist Zhu Jinshi (b 1954) in 1994. She then had solo shows at Gertrude Contemporary Art Spaces, Melbourne; Asian Fine Arts Berlin Gallery, Germany; Chambers Fine Art, New York; and Town Hall, Germany. Yin's work consistently demonstrates a concern for the relationship between the individual and the artist, with a particular interest in her home city of Beijing. She began working during a time little attention was paid to environmental degradation in China, and her signature materials are used clothing, cement, and discarded building materials, all of which she uses to highlight the impermanence and fragility of the human environment. Yin has participated in group exhibitions such as China 8, an exhibition of Chinese contemporary art in eight cities and nine museums in the Rhine-Ruhr region, Germany, (2015), the 5th Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Art (2013), the 4th Yokohama Triennale (2011), the 7th Shanghai Biennale (2008), the 52nd Venice Biennale (2007), the 14th Biennale of Sydney (2004) and the 26th São Paulo Art Biennial (2004). Her work has been the subject of solo presentation at the Groninger Museum, the Netherlands (2012) and the Museum of Modern Art, New York (2010). In 2000 she was the recipient of the China Contemporary Art Award and the UNESCO/ASCHBERG Bursary for artists. Yin is married to fellow artist Song Dong and currently lives and works in Beijing. She and Song Dong will have their work shown in Art Basel Hong Kong on March 24–26, 2016 at the Pace Gallery."

  "text" : "Yoo Byung-eun (Hangul: 유병언; hanja: 兪炳彦; RR: Yu Byeong-eon; 11 February 1941 – 2014) was a South Korean religious leader, businessman, and inventor, who as a photographer was known under the art name Ahae. Due to his reclusiveness, he was known as \"the millionaire with no face\". Believed to be the de facto leader of the company operating the ferry MV Sewol that sank en route from Incheon towards Jeju on 16 April 2014, Yoo had gone into hiding and was Korea's most-wanted fugitive, after the Incheon District Court issued an arrest warrant on 22 May. South Korean authorities initially offered a ₩50 million (~US$48,800) reward for information leading to the arrest of Yoo. On 25 May the reward was raised tenfold to ₩500 million (~US$488,000). On 21 July, it was reported that a body found in a field in June is believed to be Yoo's."

  "text" : "Yente Serdatzky (Serdatsky) (15 September 1877 – 1 May 1962) was a Jewish-American Yiddish-language writer. Serdatzky was born as Yente Raybman, in Aleksat (Aleksotas), near  Kovno (Kaunas), Lithuania (then in the Russian Empire), the daughter of a used furniture dealer who was also a scholar. She received a secular as well as a basic Jewish education, and learned German, Russian, and Hebrew. The family home was a gathering place for Yiddish writers around Kovno, including Avrom Reyzen, and in this way she became acquainted with contemporary Yiddish literature. Serdatzky married and had three children, and eventually ran her own grocery store. In 1905, the year of the Russian Revolution, she took the radical step of leaving her family and moving to Warsaw, to pursue her writing. There she came into contact with the literary circle around I. L. Peretz. She had her literary debut with the story \"Mirl,\" published in the Yiddish daily newspaper Der Veg (The Way), of which Peretz was the literary editor. She received encouragement from Peretz, and published further work in that paper. In 1907 Serdatzky emigrated to the United States. After living initially in Chicago, she settled in New York City, where she supported herself at first by running a soup kitchen. She published short stories, sketches, and one-act plays in Yiddish periodicals including Fraye arbeter shtime (Free Voice of Labor), Fraye gezelshaft (Free Society), Tsukunft (Future), Dos naye Land (The New Land), and Fraynd (Friend). She also published stories regularly in the Forverts (The Forward), and became a contributing editor there. In 1922, following a disagreement with Forverts editor Abraham Cahan, Serdatzky was dismissed from the staff. After that she dropped out of the literary scene, and supported herself in part by renting rooms. Much later in her life, from 1949 to 1955, she published over 30 stories in Isaac Liebman's Nyu-yorker vokhnblat (New York weekly paper). Abraham Cahan described Serdatzky in 1914 as a successful writer of \"tales of real life.\" The characters in her fiction are often women like herself, immigrants and intellectuals, inspired by left-wing political ideals, while facing disappointment in their everyday lives and relationships. Her stories at times convey a sense of \"pervasive loneliness.\" Serdatzky's only book publication was Geklibene shriftn (Collected writings), published in New York by the Hebrew Publishing Company, in 1913."

  "text" : "Yorgo Bacanos (born in Silivri, Turkey in 1900, died in Istanbul in 1977; Γιώργος Μπατζανός in Greek) was a master oud player and improvisational composer of Ottoman classical music. His father Haralambos was of Greek gypsy descent, and a legendary oud improviser, and several in his family were kemençe artists. He was largely responsible for introducing the young Yorgo to music, presenting him with his first oud at the age of five. Yorgo soon left school (the Saint Benoit High School) to concentrate on music full-time--he had made his first public appearance in the Eftalofos Club in Taksim at the age of twelve.Rapidly achieving fame, he started performing on Turkish Radio in 1927, and went on performing there for 51 years, until his death. In 1928, he visited Berlin with his brother Aleko, and Kanuni Ahmet Yatman and performed in records of Hafiz Kemal and Hafiz Sadettin Kaynak; in the next year, he performed in Paris, with the violinist  Sadi Işılay, and Deniz Kızı Eftalya; he further went on to Cairo with the same band. He played with the other masters of his era, including Münir Nurettin Selçuk and Zeki Müren in Turkey, and Umm Kulthum and Munir Bashir in the Arab world. Yorgo Bacanos also gave concerts in many European countries, and became one of the finest and renowned oud players of his time (alongside Udi Hrant Kenkulian). His technique and musicality proved influential, and his distinctive variations are still being performed at present."

Yelitza Lora de la Cruz (born 12 July 1985) is a Radio and TV hostess, dancer, model, and theatre and film actress from the Dominican Republic. When she was 11 years old, Lora won the beauty pageant Nuestra Belleza Infantil. She then worked as dancer and model in several TV shows in the Dominican Republic. Over time, she became overweight and in 2009 she got bariatric surgery, going from 200 pounds (91 kg) to just 120 pounds (54 kg); her new look helped raise her profile and popularity in the Dominican media. In the following years, she gained notoriety for her romantic relationships. In 2014, Lora expressed regret regarding her surgery, and enunciated that she \"is an example of those who had bariatric [surgery] but afterwards were still unhappy\". After losing weight in 2009, she obtained several jobs in various television and radio programs.On 2012, Lora was introduced to the film industry with her appearance in Feo de Día, Lindo de Noche."

Manasherov finished eighth in the 74-kg division at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Créteil, France, and later represented his nation Israel at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He also trained as a member of the wrestling team for Hapoel Rehovot Sports Club under his personal coach Leva Zimkin. Coming from one of the most prestigious wrestling families in the former Soviet Union, Manasherov competed along with his cousin, three-time Olympian, and 2003 world champion Gocha Tsitsiashvili in numerous global tournaments. Manasherov qualified for the Israeli squad in the men's 74 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by receiving a berth and rounding out the top eight spots from the World Championships. Manasherov suffered through a vulnerable game plan, as he lost his opening match 8–0 to Kazakhstan's Danil Khalimov, and was haplessly pinned by Spain's José Alberto Recuero in his second bout within a span of two minutes. Finishing last in the prelim pool and nineteenth overall in the final standings, Manasherov failed to advance further into the quarterfinals."

  "text" : "Yakov Aleksandrovich Slashchov (Яков Александрович Слащёв; 1885-1929) was a leading commander of Baron Wrangel's Crimean army who reconciled to the Soviets and returned from Constantinople to Moscow in 1921. He was killed in his Moscow apartment by a Jew named Lazar Kalenberg, apparently in revenge for the execution of his brother. Slashchov, known among his subordinates by the name of General Yasha, joined the Volunteer Army in December 1917 and was appointed Andrei Shkuro's chief of staff in May 1918. He was promoted to the rank of Major General in May 1919, to that of Lieutenant General in May 1920 and was put in charge of the Crimean Corps of the Volunteer Army in December 1919. He succeeded in defending the Perekop Isthmus from the Red Army in late December 1919 and prevented the Bolsheviks from penetrating the Crimea. Slashchov and his aide Sharov were notorious for their cruelty against the Jews and looting the population (often against Wrangel's orders). Slashchov's sometimes bitter criticism of Wrangel's decisions led to his being convicted of insubordination and stripped of his rank. He retired to Constantinople where he earned his living by gardening before returning to the Soviet Crimea. Slashov's example was instrumental in bringing many other retired White Army officers back to Soviet Russia. He published a memoir entitled The Crimea in 1920 and delivered lectures at the Vystrel Higher Officers' Courses before he was killed by a man avenging a relative's death. The circumstances leading to his death are disputed. The central character of Mikhail Bulgakov's play Flight is supposed to be based on Slashchov."

On June 21, 2014, she was arrested along with at least 30 other activists who were marching near Ittihadiya Palace, the Presidential offices in Cairo, in a peaceful demonstration against the Egyptian law that curtails the right to protest. Her trial along with 22 fellow demonstrators, all charged with violating the protest law, has become a symbol of resistance to harsh restrictions on dissent imposed by the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Amnesty International called the case a \"show-trial based on scant and dubious evidence that is intended to be a clear warning to anyone who defies Egypt’s protest law.\""
