  "text" : "Zelda Kingoff Nordlinger was a prominent and influential member of the women’s rights movement in Richmond, Virginia throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century. Born in South Carolina in 1932, Nordlinger relocated to Virginia with her family in the late 1940s. After attending the Sally Thomkins School of Practical Nursing, Nordlinger graduated in 1984 from Virginia Commonwealth University with a Bachelor of Arts degree. She went on to become one of the founding members of the Richmond Chapter of the National Organization for Women in 1969, establishing a significant activist institution within Richmond’s conservative climate. This organization focuses its efforts on alleviating unbalanced political, economic, legislative, and societal statutes which work against the advancement and equality of women. Nordlinger continued to contribute to the women’s liberation movement via her involvement in a number of influential reform groups including the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood and the Women’s Lobby of Virginia. Her efforts played a significant role in the evolution of rape legislation within the state as well as the formation of significant groups dedicated to the feminist cause. Zelda Kingoff Nordlinger died in March 2008, leaving behind a legacy of activism on behalf of women’s liberation in Virginia."

He had several brothers named Balash, Hormizd III, and Peroz I. After the death of Peroz I (who had succeeded his father as king), Balash was elected as king by the nobility and clergy. Zarir, dissatisfied with the election, rebelled. Balash was thus forced to make peace with his enemy Vahan Mamikonian and sent him at the head of an army to suppress the rebellion of Zarir. Zarir was shortly defeated, and fled to the mountains, but was quickly captured and \"shot down like an animal\"."

  "text" : "Zander Hollander (March 24, 1923 – April 11, 2014) was an American sportswriter, journalist, editor and archivist. Many years before the Internet and unfinished cable television system emerged, Hollander served as a prolific supplier of encyclopedias on every major sport. At this point, he edited, wrote or packaged around 300 books over a professional career that spanned 45 years. Born as Alexander Hollander in Brooklyn, New York, he grew up in Far Rockaway, Queens. At age 14, he found his emerging sports ability writing columns for a neighborhood newspaper, and then in high school, he wrote for the Long Island Daily Press and the New York World-Telegram. He later attended Queens College but left to serve in the Army Air Forces, assigned to an Army newspaper in Hawaii. After his discharge, he enrolled at City College of New York but did not graduate. The heavy workload never really ended for Hollander. In 1955 he founded Associated Features, a company which produced booklets that were distributed with assorted promotional products, but it was not a lucrative enterprise. Even when immersed in several editorial projects, he would occasionally take a freelance shift on the Daily News sports desk. After a stint with United Press International as an editor in New York, Hollander was hired as a sportswriter by the World-Telegram, originally to cover yachting. Before he committed full-time to his company in the mid-1960s, his day might consist of visiting potential clients and writing on a freelance basis for magazines, followed by phone calls to Western Union so he could meet the World-Telegram midnight deadline. Besides this, he reported for the Associated Press about his stay in the Soviet Union. Hollander decided to quit newspapers in 1966, when he rejected an offer to work as editor of the World-Telegram and Sun, as it had become after merging with two other New York newspapers, the Herald Tribune and the Journal-American. He then turned his attention to his Associated Features business in the years to come. From 1971 through 1997, Hollander found a niche in the bookstores by annually providing career statistics and profiles of players, team rosters, all-time records, articles with photos, scouting reports, schedules and predictions for the upcoming season, in the form of brick-size tomes, 400-plus pages, he titled Complete Handbooks. In them, he showed his experience and deep knowledge of professional baseball, basketball, football, hockey and tennis, as well as jai alai, soccer and college basketball and football. But the aforementioned yearbooks of Hollander were just one part his multifaceted sports knowledge. He also chronicled sports bloopers and wrote a history of Madison Square Garden, among other subjects. During his time as a journalist, he started a lifelong friendship with a then young lawyer, Howard Cosell, who represented the Little League of New York and had been asked by the local radio station WABC to host a show featuring youth ballplayers. Hollander agreed to collaborate by writing scripts and recruiting sports celebrities for the show. Interestingly, they were not paid for their services, but it represented the beginning of a successful sports broadcasting career for Cosell. In a 2001 interview, Hollander explained that as soon as he could hold a pencil and throw a ball, he dreamed of being a sportswriter. At the same time, he remembered that his first journalism effort was writing on a mimeographed newspaper in elementary school. Zander Hollander suffered from Alzheimer's disease during his later life. He died on April 11, 2014 in Manhattan, New York, at the age of 91."

  "text" : "Zhang Shichuan (Wade–Giles: Chang Shih-ch'uan; 1889–1953 or 1890–1954) was a Chinese entrepreneur, film director, and film producer, who is considered a founding father of Chinese cinema. He and Zheng Zhengqiu made the first Chinese feature film, The Difficult Couple, in 1913, and cofounded the Mingxing (Star) Film Company in 1922, which became the largest film production company in China under Zhang's leadership. Zhang directed about 150 films in his career, including Laborer's Love (1922), the earliest complete Chinese film that has survived; Orphan Rescues Grandfather (1923), one of the first Chinese box-office hits; The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple (1928), the first martial arts film; and Sing-Song Girl Red Peony (1931), China's first sound film. After the destruction of Mingxing's studio by Japanese bombing during the 1937 Battle of Shanghai, Zhang Shichuan made films for the China United Film Production Company (Zhonglian) in Japanese-occupied Shanghai, which led to accusations of treason after the surrender of Japan in 1945. He never recovered from the humiliation, and died in 1953 or 1954."

  "text" : "Zhang Jialong (simplified Chinese: 张贾龙; traditional Chinese: 張賈龍; pinyin: Zhɑ̄ng Jiɑ̌lóng) born on May 22, 1988, in Guiyang, Guizhou Province, is a Chinese journalist, blogger and a former editor of Tencent Finance. He graduated from Inner Mongolia University in 2010 where he majored in history, stumbled on his first job and became a journalist. He reported for the financial news magazine Caijing about the forceful demolition of artist Ai Weiwei's workshop in Shanghai. He also covered Zhao Lianhai, a father whose son was a victim of melamine-tainted milk formula, and other rights defenders. In April, 2011, he was interrogated by Beijing police for 24 hours, and his home ransacked, for tweeting \"today on taxi the driver said that two third of taxi drivers in Beijing will stage a strike during the May First holidays.\" He was subsequently given a 10-day administrative detention for \"posting false information on an overseas website Twitter that was retweeted 37 times and caused disruption of social order.\" The incident was listed as a \"significant, particularly sensitive case” by the criminal detection squad of the public transportation unit of Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, and he was called by the Beijing police a \"dangerous element\" who \"incited a strike online\" and “attempted to provoke disruptions and harm the capital city’s public transportation order.\" On February 15, 2014, Zhang was invited to be one of four Chinese bloggers to meet with United States Secretary of State John Kerry during his China trip. At the 40-minute meeting on Feb. 15, Zhang asked Mr.Kerry \"Will you get together with the Chinese who aspire for freedom\" and help \"tear down this Great Firewall that blocks the Internet\". Zhang also asked Mr. Kerry to look into reports that American companies had helped the Chinese government establish controls over what websites Chinese citizens could access. Zhang said the situation for political and human rights activists has not improved. He was worried about \"prisoners of conscience,\" specifically Xu Zhiyong, a human-rights activist who was sentenced last month to four years in prison, and Liu Xiaobo, a writer and activist who was imprisoned after being charged with \"inciting subversion of state power.\" While in prison, Mr. Liu was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. Zhang wanted to know if Mr. Kerry would visit Liu Xia, wife of Liu Xiaobo, who had been under house arrest since his Nobel Prize win and who, he had heard, was suffering from illnesses. The secretary of state said that the issue of Chinese political prisoners was brought up every time he met with the Chinese officials. Mr. Kerry did not directly respond to that appeal but noted he was only here for a day and a half. On February 16, the Chinese propaganda authorities ordered all web portals to delete reports about \"the U.S. Secretary of State meeting with four Chinese social media big Vs to talk about 'Internet freedom'\". Meanwhile, his name became a sensitive word on Tencent Weibo. Though he could still log in his Weibo account and post, but a search for his name would yield \"search result cannot be displayed according to relevant laws, regulations and policies.\" On February 17, the Global Times published an editorial titled \"Asking the US Secretary of State for 'Freedom' Was a Pretty Cute Show,\" criticizing Zhang Jialong without citing his name and the appeal he had made to Mr. Kerry about Chinese Internet freedom, and referring to him as a dissident. Known for inciting nationalist sentiment, the Global Times is an offshoot of the People's Daily, the communist party's mouthpiece. On February 19, upon invitation by the Foreign Policy website, Zhang wrote an article spelling out everything he would like to say to Mr. Kerry. He said, \"Since 1949, Chinese dictators have robbed their people of their freedom, forcing the country’s citizens to live in fear. China's people are still unable to freely access the World Wide Web. For many years, Chinese who aspire to freedom have spilled their blood and sweat fighting for it. Chinese people will continue to try to push down every wall erected by their dictatorial government, but if the United States could help in the effort to tear down China’s notorious Great Firewall, it would help China realize internet freedom sooner.\" He also called on the U.S. to implement visa sanctions on those who contributed to creating the GFW, such as Fang Binxing, the father of Great Firewall. On May 20, he was notified by the department head at Tencent that he was being suspended, citing radical expressions he made in his meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and the propaganda directives he publicized online. He was told that he would receive a final decision after Tencent coordinated with the propaganda authorities.On May 23, Tencent’s HR department notified him of the termination of his labor contract for \"leaking business secrets and other confidential and sensitive information.\" On May 30, The U.S. has expressed deep concern about the reported firing of a Chinese blogger who had met with Secretary of State John Kerry and urged the U.S. to challenge China's Internet restrictions.The State Department said it would be very troubling if a private employee was fired for publicly expressing his views. The U.S. also voiced concern over China's \"continuing crackdown\" on free speech."

  "text" : "Sultan Zainul Abidin (died 5 October 1579) was the seventh sultan of Aceh in northern Sumatra. His reign was the last of three brief ones in the year 1579. Zainul Abidin was the son of Sultan Ghori alias Abdullah, who was the vassal ruler of Aru (Deli) and died in battle in 1568. He was the grandson of Sultan Alauddin al-Kahar. After the rapid deaths of the sultans Ali Ri'ayat Syah I, Sultan Muda and Sri Alam, he was placed on the throne of Aceh in 1579. However, according to the chronicles he was only interested in pleasures and especially enjoyed animal fights and life-and-death fights between humans. It was even alleged that he had no appetite before he had seen blood flowing. He also behaved in a tyrannical way towards his uleëbalangs (chiefs). The chiefs therefore resolved to get rid of him. The plotters put him on an elephant and brought him to Makota Alam where he was murdered. This happened on 5 October 1579. He was succeeded by Alauddin Mansur Syah who did not belong to the old sultan's family."

  "text" : "Zechariah (Yaḥya) al-Ḍāhirī (Hebrew: זכריה אלצ'אהרי‎‎, pronounced [zekharˈyah al-dhahˈiri]; often spelled Zechariah al-Dhahiri (Arabic: زكريا الضاهري‎‎); the son of Saʻīd (Saʻadia) al-Ḍāhirī, from Kawkaban, in the District of al-Mahwit, Yemen, a place north-west of Sana’a, b. circa 1531 – d. 1608) was a Yemenite Jewish poet and rabbinic scholar of the 16th century who left Yemen in search of a better livelihood and who traveled to Calicut and Cochin in India, Hormuz in Persia, Basra and Irbīl in Babylonia, Bursa and Istanbul in Turkey, Rome in Italy, Aleppo and Damascus in Syria, Safed and Tiberius, as well as Jerusalem and Hebron in the Land of Israel, Sidon in Lebanon and Egypt, and finally unto Abyssinia where he returned to Yemen by crossing the Erythraean Sea and alighting at a port city near Mocha, Yemen. He wrote extensively about his travels and experiences in these places, publishing them in a book which he called, Sefer Ha-Mūsar (The Book of Moral Instruction). The book is one of the finest examples of Hebrew literary genius ever written in Yemen, its author making use of a poetic genre known as maqāma, a prosimetric literary genre of rhymed prose with intervals of poetry in which rhetorical extravagance is conspicuous, to describe his journeys. Al-Ḍāhirī, who is clearly very adept in the Hebrew tongue, admits to having modeled his own poetry – two-hundred and seventy-five of which poems are found in his Sefer Ha-Mūsar and in his Sefer Haʻanaḳ – on the Hebrew work Taḥkemoni of Alḥarizi, who, in turn, was influenced by the Arabic maqāmāt of al-Ḥarīrī. His vivid descriptions of the town Safed and of Rabbi Joseph Karo’s yeshiva are of primary importance to historians, seeing that they are a first-hand account of these places, and the only extant account which describes the yeshiva of the great Sephardic Rabbi, Joseph Karo. With his broad Jewish education and his exceptional skills in his use of the Hebrew language, Zechariah al-Ḍāhirī is an important source in the study of Jewish history in the Land of Israel during the Renaissance and of Jewish persecution in Yemen at that time."

  "text" : "Zhu Binhou (Chinese: 朱斌侯; pinyin: Zhū Bīnhóu; Wade–Giles: Tsu Pin-hou; 4 December 1885 – ?), also known as Etienne Tsu, was an early Chinese aviator. Born in Shanghai, Zhu was a son of the prominent banker Zhu Zhiyao (朱志尧, a.k.a. Nicolas Tsu). He left for France to study mechanical engineering at the Université Lille 1, graduating in 1903. As he was fascinated with the design and operation of automobiles and ships, 1903 also brought about the revolutionary advent of the controlled, sustained, and powered heavier-than-air machines, which had driven Zhu Binhou into this new frontier of human flight. Zhu Binhou gained his aviator's license, issued by the Aero Club de France, in 1914 at the beginning of World War I, and joined, as part of the French Foreign Legion, Escadrille SPA.37 of the French Air Service in 1915; he is credited with downing five German aircraft and observation balloons, and four probables between 10 July 1916 and 7 January 1917."

She was given the responsibility to organize the entire medical military system in Hungary. She also sent an appeal for women to volunteer as medical nurses, and organized the volunteering nurses. After the defeat, she was arrested by the Austrians. She was released, but harassed by the authorities. When she was arrested a second time in 1851, the Americans intervened, and managed to have her released on the condition that she never returned to Hungary. After this, she emigrated to the USA. She died in New York of a lung ailment on June 29, 1854."

Having begun her career at a clinic in Alexandra Township, Stein and her husband Mervyn Susser left South Africa in 1955 for political reasons. They spent a decade at Manchester University, where they were active in the Anti-Apartheid Movement, before leaving for New York. Stein's research has included work on child development, contraception, psychiatric disorders, miscarriage, preterm delivery and birth defects. With Susser, she published a now famous paper on the epidemiology of peptic ulcer. Towards the end of their careers, Stein and Susser focused increasingly on HIV advocacy and research, both in the United States and in their native South Africa. With other health activists, they organised a meeting in Maputo in April 1990, which aimed to alert the African National Congress to the threat. The impact of this meeting was limited. With others, they were, however, successful in securing funding for a programme of HIV/AIDS research in Southern Africa  and Stein and Susser served as co-directors of the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies in 1999."

Heyns was born in Antwerp as the son of the schoolmaster Peeter Heyns, who was known for his French schoolbooks and translations from Dutch to French and back. The Heyns family moved to Frankfurt after the fall of Antwerp and when the elder Heyns moved to Stade in 1592, Zacharias became a publisher in Amsterdam near the Oude Kerk and married Anne Hureau. His first published works were a few Latin books by Eilhard Lubinus and schoolbooks by his father, and after his father's death he published maps of Holland with poetic comments under them in Den Nederlandtschen Landtspiegel in 1599. A copy of this book was found recently found by the Flevoland archives in a moving box originally from the Rijksdienst voor de Ijsselmeerpolders and won a contest for \"archive piece of the year\". In Amsterdam he became one of the founding members of the chamber of rhetoric called Wit lavender for which he wrote two plays. He became friends with many Southern Netherlands refugees in Amsterdam and Haarlem, including Karel van Mander and others. Heyns moved to Zwolle in 1606, where he opened a publishing company located behind what is now the Vrouwenhuis. It is there where he wrote an account of the 1609 international rhetoric contest in Haarlem for Trou moet Blycken. In 1615 and 1616 he wrote poetry for the Schiedam chamber of rhetoric called \"De Roode Rosen\", and in 1625 he published his poetry in an emblem book which became popular. He died in Zwolle."
