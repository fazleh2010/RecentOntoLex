  "text" : "Adolf Stachel (born 28 February 1913 in Augsburg, died 1971 in Frankfurt am Main) was a German chemist, researcher and inventor, who worked as a researcher at the chemical and pharmaceutical company Cassella (now Sanofi) in Frankfurt-Fechenheim for much of his career. He held a doctoral degree in chemistry (Doktor-Ingenieur) from the Technische Hochschule München. Early in his career, he was a mentee and collaborator of the Nobel Prize-winning chemist Hans Fischer, who was his doctoral supervisor. He later became a researcher at Cassella. His patents were related to basically substituted heterocyclic compounds, e.g. 2,3-benzotriazine-4(3H)-one derivatives (coumarin), and basically substituted 1H,3H)-quinazoline-2-thion-4-one derivatives, having excellent coronary dilator properties. Patentee was Cassella. When working at Cassella, he was a close collaborator of Armin K.W. Kutzsche. Together with Werner Zerweck they developed Nu-nu-dibenzylsulfamyl benzoic acid, US patent 2805250 A, in the early 1950s. Other frequent collaborators were Rudi Beyerle, Rolf-Eberhard Nitz and Klaus Resag. He was married to Ingeburg Lydia Katharina Rohde."

Pfeiffer's first gardens were made in England, Austria, and Germany, followed by a number of commissions in Australia. He is based in Sydney and London, and has since worked around the world. Two Pfeiffer-designed gardens (a desert garden in Sydney and a woodland garden of A. Alfred Taubman in Michigan) were featured in the 2008 book Luxury Private Gardens. Pfeiffer wrote: \"When gardens like the one at Château de Courances in the Île-de-France near Paris or the Odette Monteiro estate at Correias near Rio de Janeiro are stripped down to their bare essentials, they are like a well-cut couturier’s gown—nothing but an utterly simple response to the unadorned landscape or the naked human body they are designed to fit.\" Pfeiffer believes that \"great gardens have a timeless quality\" and \"should be thought of with a long view, and not in terms of superficial and fleeting fashion.\" \"The natural surroundings, combined with a sense of place, should always determine the character of a garden.\""

  "text" : "Adah Matilda Robinson (July 13, 1882 – March 10, 1962) was an American artist, designer and teacher, who influenced many other artists, especially architects, during the first half of the 20th century. Born in Indiana, she was educated in art schools in the Chicago area, as well as receiving private lessons from noted artist there during the late 19th century. Adah moved with her family to Oklahoma City, where she began teaching art. She moved to Tulsa and became the first art teacher at Tulsa High School. One of the pupils in her first class was the aspiring artist, Bruce Goff. Later, she taught another student, Joseph R. Koberling, Jr., who would also become a noted architect. In 1928, she was hired as the founder and chairperson of the Art Department at the University of Tulsa. Robinson never claimed to be an architect, nor did she have any formal training in the subject. She was primarily a painter and a printmaker, as well as an art teacher. Yet, she is best known for her role in designing the Boston Avenue Methodist Church in Tulsa, which is now a National Historic Landmark and considered an exceptional example of Art Deco architecture, although controversy surrounds whether she or her former student, Bruce Goff, deserves more credit for the church's distinctive design. During her lifetime, many people did not believe that a woman could be responsible for such a work. In 1948, after a University of Tulsa official disputed her role in the design of the church, she resigned her position at the school and accepted a similar position at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. She retired from Trinity in 1959 and moved back to Tulsa, where she continued to work privately. Never married, she died in Tulsa on March 10, 1962."

  "text" : "Alessandro Fersen (5 December 1911 – 3 October 2001) was a Polish-born Italian dramatist, actor, theater director, author and drama teacher. Born Aleksander Fajrajzen in Łódź to a Jewish family, Fersen he moved to Genoa with his family in 1913. A student under Giuseppe Rensi, in 1934 he graduated in philosophy from the University of Genoa with a thesis later published under the title L'Universo come giuoco (\"The Universe as a game\"). Due to the racial laws of 1938 he moved to Paris (where he attended the Collège de France) and then in Eastern Europe. Back in Italy in 1943, he participated in the resistance in Liguria, in a partisan group linked to the Italian Socialist Party, before working in Switzerland, where he became friends with Emanuele Luzzati and Giorgio Colli. He returned to Italy at the end of World War II, and after a period in which he devoted himself to political activity (being a member of the Secretary of the National Liberation Committee of Genoa and Liguria) and journalism (as a collaborator of newspapers Il Lavoro and Corriere del Popolo), in 1947 he began his activity as a theater director with the drama Leah Lebowitz, a play which he had taken from a Hasidic legend; this play started with the artistic collaboration, which will last decades, with Emanuele Luzzati, with whom founded the \"Teatro Ebraico\" (\"Jewish Theatre\"), staging dramas written by him such as Golem (1969), inspired by the Yiddish folklore, or Leviathan (1974), based on the techniques of mnemodrama. From 1947 Fersen worked for more than a decade for the Teatro Stabile of Genoa, directing adaptations of Shakespeare, Pirandello, Molière, Anouilh, among others. In 1957 he began a career as a drama teacher founding an acting school in Rome, the \"Studio di arti sceniche\", inspired by the Stanislavski's system. He was also an author of critical and theoretical essays, aimed at an interdisciplinary theater, and an actor active on stage, on television and in films."

  "text" : "Adrienne D'Ambricourt (born Adrienne DuNontier; 2 June 1878 – 6 December 1957) was a French actress of the silent and sound film eras. She was born in Paris, and emigrated to the United States after the end of World War I. She began acting in the 1922 Gershwin Broadway musical comedy, The French Doll, in which she had one of the main roles, \"Baroness Mazulier\". She made her film debut in the 1924 silent film, The Humming Bird, where she was one of Gloria Swanson's gang of thieves who turned into resistance fighters in World War I. With the advent of talking pictures, and before dubbing came into general use, D'Ambricourt was used in several films which were the French version of English language ones, such as Quand on est belle (The Easiest Way — 1931), L'énigmatique Mr. Parkes (Slightly Scarlet — 1930), and Nuit d'Espagne (Transgression — 1931). She appeared in over 70 films, including such classics as Casablanca, San Francisco, and To Have And Have Not, until about 1947, after which her film career began to decline. Her final role was in George Cukor's Les Girls, starring Gene Kelly and Mitzi Gaynor, in which she played the wardrobe woman. With the advent of television, she appeared in several series during the 1950s, working right up to her death, which was caused by a heart attack during or following a car accident in Los Angeles."

After a brief spell in the late 1430s in Castiglione Olona (near Milan), as an assistant in Masolino’s workshop, he returned to Siena, where in the 1440s he quickly established him- self as one of the most progressive artists in the city. This was a time when the Renaissance avant-garde of Sienese painters, headed by Domenico di Bartolo and Lorenzo Vecchietta, were eagerly assimilating the innovations of the leading Florentine artists of the early Renaissance. Following in the footsteps of the leading Florentine painters and sculptors – Masaccio, Masolino, Filippo Lippi, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Donatello – they reformed the traditional formulas of Sienese painting without breaking with their own well-established traditions. These artists permeated their old Sienese formulas and inventions with a Renaissance spirit and produced pictures of major physical substance, consequently scenes of higher empathy, and, in the case of the splendid frescoes of the Pellegrinaio of the Ospedale di Santa Maria della Scala in Siena, episodes embedded in fantastic architectural settings, constructed as eccentric expressions of the newly acquired rules of perspective within an artistic vocabulary of no lesser eccentricity inspired by the classical world."

  "text" : "Abel Aken Hunter (September 18, 1877 – April 6, 1935) was an American botanist notable for his contributions to science primarily in the collection of the orchids of Panama. From 1915-1935, he was a team member on scientifically significant orchid hunting expeditions with many of the collectors and researchers of the day: Charles Powell, George Pring, Carroll Dodge, Julian Steyermark, and Paul Allen. He earned his reputation in field work as an outgrowth of his friendship with Charles Powell. In a unique period in Panama's history, his first orchid collecting adventure took place with Powell during a fishing trip on the newly man-created Gatun Lake in 1912. By 1915, both Hunter and Powell were living and working in Balboa, Panama. As a hobby, Powell started an orchid garden. Beginning in 1918, the two men would spend leave periods from their employment on extended collecting expeditions: their mission morphing over the years from that of hobby collecting to systematic scientific collecting. In 1919, Powell submitted their findings for identification to German botanist Rudolf Schlechter who published, in 1922, Orchidaceae Powellianae Panamenses, a 95-page study of Powell's Panama orchids—Schlechter naming five of the new to science species to honor Hunter. To supplement the plant collection at the Missouri Botanical Garden's (MBG) Tropical Station in Balboa, Panama, in 1927, Hunter trekked with George Pring on a month-long collecting expedition in Panama's Chiriquí region. In 1928, Hunter became the second manager of the Tropical Station. In 1934-35, as part of MBG collection teams including Carroll Dodge, Julian Steyermark, Paul Allen and Hunter, more than 740 collection records (herbarium specimens) crediting Hunter were submitted for study to the MBG's herbarium in St. Louis, Missouri; Hunter's specimen records are found online in the Tropicos database. Hunter and Allen's herbarium specimens can be found in the Oakes Ames Herbarium at Harvard University—four of which proved to be new to science species. The records generated by these expeditions not only document the time and location of specific species but continue to provide scientists and anyone wishing to see them an opportunity for study via digital images in virtual herbaria."

Released after the war, he returned to Poland and joined the armed forces of the newly established Kingdom of Poland in the rank of Captain. He quickly rose through the ranks. Initially the commanding officer of the 5th Line Infantry Regiment, he was soon promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. After the outbreak of the November Uprising of 1831 he briefly commanded the 4th Foot Rifles Regiment and then the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division (between 28 February and 26 March 1831). He briefly served as the chief of staff of the 4th Infantry Division and was promoted to the rank of Brigade General on 12 May 1831. During the Battle of Warsaw he commanded one of the sectors of Polish defence of the city. After the Polish defeat he was among the highest-ranking Polish officers to cross the border into East Prussia where the remaining Polish forces capitulated. He then settled in France. He died 3 December 1838 in Paris and is buried at Montmartre Cemetery, in a common grave shared by many notable members of the Great Emigration, notably Joachim Lelewel."

Upon his return, he took a position administering the soldier settlement scheme at Penola, and later became a sheep farmer at Naracoorte. He was elected to the House of Assembly at the 1965 election, and promoted to Cabinet in the last months of the Hall ministry in 1970. He again served in Cabinet when his party regained power in 1979 under David Tonkin, most notably as Chief Secretary, which included responsibilities for police and prisons. His ministerial term saw him deal with a number of controversial issues, including introduction of random breath testing for South Australian drivers, changes to the operation of prisons in the state, and public concern around police corruption. He resigned from the ministry in 1982 and retired from parliament in 1985."

  "text" : "Alayne Fleischmann is a lawyer formerly employed by JPMorgan Chase. She is known as the whistleblower who provided evidence resulting in a $9 billion settlement by JPMorgan Chase to the United States Federal Government. The case has been called one of the most significant white-collar crime cases in US history. Fleischmann was raised in Terrace, British Columbia, Canada. After leaving Canada, she attended Cornell Law School and then began working on Wall Street. Prior to entering the financial sector she had worked in human rights. But, once working in securities law, she discovered she had a passion for it. She felt that, in those days, it was a \"very respectable\" field, and that there was \"nothing shady about\" it. In 2006, after working for a few years at a law firm, she was hired by Chase as a transaction manager—a sort of quality control officer. Her main function was to ensure that Chase did not purchase bad loans. After working there for a few months, a new manager was hired as head of the \"diligence\" group. This group's purpose was to review then clear loans. Very quickly, Fleischmann encountered problems with the manager. She testified in a United States Department of Justice deposition that, this manager—within the organization, technically a superior—instructed her and others in the firm to stop any e-mail contact with him. Fleischmann said: \"If you sent him an e-mail, he would actually come out and yell at you.\" \"The whole point of having a compliance and diligence group is to have policies that are set out clearly in writing. So to have exactly the opposite of that – that was very worrisome.\" Late 2006, shortly after the manager started the \"no e-mail\" policy, the diligence group, including Fleischmann, were called upon to evaluate a $900 million packet of home loans. GreenPoint was named as the mortgage originator. Almost at once, Fleischmann and several of her colleagues who were also diligence managers found serious issues with this packet of loans. One problem was the \"suspiciously\" old dates on many of them. Ordinarily, banks wish to produce securities from loans as quickly as possible, ideally within two to three months. The loans from GreenPoint at the time were seven or eight months old. This indicated that the deal had been rejected by Chase or another bank earlier, or else were \"early payment defaults\" or EPDs (loans that had been previously sold to another institution and had been returned after the borrowers had defaulted on several payments). A review of random loan samples by Fleischmann and her team discovered approximately 40% were based on incomes that were overstated. The normal tolerance level by Chase was 5%. After Fleischmann and others stated their objections to these bad loans, the number-crunchers, who once were concerened about the loans, started to alter their reports. The diligence team concluded that there would likely be a large number of defaults in the GreenPoint package loans. The report stating this was provided to several high-ranking executives. The GreenPoint package was eventually approved. In February 2008, as part of a series of layoffs, Fleischmann was fired. Fleischmann returned to Canada. In spring 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission contacted her as part of an investigation into Chase. She stated that she would tell them all she knew about Chase's systemic fraud, in particular, GreenPoint. However, the SEC was more concerned with Chase's dealings with a company called WMC. In late 2012 and early 2013, civil litigators from the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of California interviewed her. Fleischmann provided lead attorney Richard Elias and his team with complete information about the directive not to send e-mails, the sabotage of the diligence process, bullying by her superiors, and that written warnings were ignored. She assumed her statements would lead to prosecution. However, Eric Holder's expected September 24, 2013 announcement of civil-fraud charges against Chase were canceled. Later news reports state that Jamie Dimon had called United States Associate Attorney General Tony West to ask that the case be settled out of court. According to The New York Times, Dimon had offered $3 billion to settle out of court, which was rejected, then offered more, which was also rejected. As a bargaining chip, Fleischmann's evidence was used by the Department of Justice to persuade Dimon to offer approximately $9 billion as a settlement. From 2012 to 2013, she articled at a Calgary law firm. This is a prerequisite to practicing law in Canada. She is presently not working and lives in Vancouver, British Columbia."

  "text" : "Captain Arthur Haggerty (December 3, 1931 – July 3, 2006), was an American character actor and the self-proclaimed American pioneer in the field of dog training. Born in the Bronx on December 3, 1931, it is said that Captain Haggerty made dog training the respected profession it is today. Raised in the Bronx while other children played stick ball, he begged his parents to take him to dog shows. He had an affinity to Boxers, Doberman Pinschers and German Shepherds. He wanted to become a show dog handler. During his three combat tours in Korea, he served as the Captain of the K9 Corps. His illustrious record in the United States Army included a Congressional Commendation and a Bronze Star. After returning from Korea, in 1961 or 1962, he opened Tri State School for Dogs then eventually renamed it Captain Haggerty's School for Dogs. His school grew into the largest dog training school on the east coast and had a celebrity clientele that included: Liza Minnelli, Walt Frazier, Flip Wilson, Terry Shields, Leona Helmsley among others. In the early 1970s he began supplying dogs for film, television and Broadway. In the Burt Reynolds' movie Shamus, not only did they use his dogs for many scenes, the producer loved his look and put him in front of the camera. He became known as Mr. Clean with his bald head and blue eyes. Some of his movie credits include: Married to the Mob, Honeymoon in Vegas, The Last Dragon and a memorably gruesome appearance in the opening scenes of director Lucio Fulci's horror classic Zombi 2 as a rotting, shambling zombie that attacks a coast guard officer on a derelict boat. His television credits include guest appearances on various talk show such as The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, The Morton Downey Jr. Show and David Letterman where he and his dog students appeared 26 times pioneering Stupid Pet Tricks. According to Haggerty, his dual profession of being a character actor and dog trainer caused some confusion among his dog school clients and his friends in the film industry. When he would show up on a film set with or without dogs to train and act with them in front of the camera, people and fellow actors would recognize him and would say to him: \"Oh, I didn't know you were an actor. I thought you trained dogs\". At his dog training school, clients would recognize him from his film and TV commercial appearances and say to him: \"Oh, I didn't know you trained dogs. I thought you were an actor.\" Since he was known as 'Captain Haggerty' at his dog school, and then known as Arthur Haggerty on film sets, he decided to legally change his name to Captain Haggerty in order to combine both of his professions so that people would know who he really was on and off camera. He wrote hundreds of articles on dogs and won several writing awards including the illustrious Howell Award given by the Dog Writer's Association of America. His three books include: Dog Tricks, How to Get Your Pet Into Show Business and How to Teach Your Dog to Talk. He also wrote and published the Aggression Newsletter from 1997 to 2006. An encyclopedia of dog knowledge, he was generous with his time and was unapologetically honest. He was called \"politically incorrect\" by Steve Dale who wrote an article for Dog World called The Politically Incorrect Captain Haggerty. Steve Dale asked him in that interview what he would like his epitaph to say, he responded that \"He was an annoying and grating individual. But he loved dogs. He saved lives. He got the job done. End of story.\" Captain Arthur Haggerty died in a hospital near his home in West Palm Beach, Florida from adenocarcinoma July 3, 2006 at age 74. Leaving his only child, a daughter, Babette Haggerty to carry on the family legacy. She is also a dog trainer, writer and mother."

  "text" : "Alfred Edward Northey (2 August 1838 – 24 January 1911) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and for another amateur side between 1857 and 1860. He was born at Uxbridge, Middlesex and died at Torquay, Devon. Northey was the son of Colonel W.B. Northey and was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He first played first-class cricket in a match for \"the Gentlemen of Kent and Sussex\" against the \"Gentlemen of England\" in 1857; as an opening batsman he made 23 and 32. He played only a single game for Cambridge University team in 1858, and in 1859, his single important match was the annual University Match against Oxford University in which he batted in the lower order. In 1860, he played three times for the university team and in the first of these appearances, against the Cambridge Town Club, he made an innings of 40 which was his highest first-class score. His last first-class game the University Match of 1860 in which he batted at No 9 in the first innings and did not bat at all in the second innings, when Cambridge won a very low-scoring game by three wickets. Northey graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1861 and was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. He was curate at All Saints' Church, Huntingdon from 1862 to 1864 and at St Martin-in-the-Fields in London from 1864 to 1869. From 1870 he was principal of Hockerill Training College until he became vicar of Offley in Hertfordshire in 1881. Northey became the vicar at Rickmansworth in 1884 and remained there until 1898 when he retired; he was also rural dean of Watford from 1896. After retirement, he briefly acted as a chaplain in Tangier, Morocco and after settling in Devon was a licensed priest in the diocese of Exeter, though without an incumbency. As a student to 1861 Northey was a captain in the 3rd Cambridgeshire Rifle Volunteers, part of the Volunteer Force. While at Hockerill, he published a book in 1872 on Pupil Teachers: Their Training and Instruction."

  "text" : "Olof \"Arne\" Hegerfors (born 4 July 1942) is a Swedish sports journalist and television presenter. He is mostly known as a sports commentator at SVT and Canal Plus between 1969 until 2011. He was awarded the Stora Journalistpriset (The great journalist award) in 1992. Hegerfors had a promising athletic career in football and had a contract offer from a French football club, OGC Nice. But after a serious knee injury he could not play anymore and moved on to a journalistic career. When Lars-Gunnar Björklund started a sports department at SVT (known as Sveriges Radio-TV until 1979) in Gothenburg and recruited Hegerfors. In 2000 Hegerfors appeared in Markoolio's music video for his song \"Mera mål\", where he acted as himself. He has also presented entertainments shows for SVT, like \"Kryzz\" and \"Det kommer mera\". He won the Swedish television Kristallens Honour Award in 2008. Hegerfors had made several memorable commentator works in ice hockey and football matches and was SVT's correspondent at the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985 when 39 people died and 376 were injured during a UEFA Champions League final between Liverpool and Juventus. He also commentated the basketball final between the Soviet Union and the United States at the 1972 Olympic Games in which the Soviet Union won with 50–49 in a discussed judge decision in the last seconds. Hegerfors is also known for many entertaining commentator styles and funny quotes, arguably his most remembered comment was made during the 1990 World Cup in a game between Cameroon and England, \"it looks dark on the substitute bench of Cameroon\", inadvertently referring to the skin colour of the Cameroon players.  However, in 2015 the authenticity of the quote was put in doubt by members of the web forum Flashback. In 2011 Hegerfors ended his working career. Hegerfors has also published one book called Ralf: en gör så gôtt en kan!."

  "text" : "Afra and Tobia Scarpa are award winning postmodern Italian architects and designers. Their pieces can be found in museums across the United States and Europe, including collections in MoMA and the Louvre Museum. They have collaborated with companies such as B&B Italia, San Lorenzo Silver, and Knoll International. They have won a number of awards such as the Compasso d'Oro in 1969 to the International Forum Design in 1992. Their design work consists of architecture and everyday household items including, furniture, clothing, interior design, art glass. They focused on the technical and aesthetic possibilities of materials in their designs. The couple was greatly influenced by Tobia’s father, Carlo Scarpa, a Venetian architect and designer. Afra Bianchin was born in Montebelluna, Italy in 1937 and Tobia Scarpa was born in Venice, Italy in 1935. Both Afra and Tobia Scarpa earned degrees in architecture from the Università Iuav di Venezia in 1957. From 1957 to 1961 Tobia worked as a glass designer at the Murano glassworks of Venini, and then in 1960 the two artists opened their own design office in Montebelluna. They designed for Gavina (sofa \"Bastiano\" 1961), and then followed with a series of projects with several other companies. Their more notable works were made for B&B Italia (sofa \"Coronado\" 1966), Cassina (armchair \"Soriana\" 1968), and Meritalia (chair \"Libert\" 1989). In 1964, they collaborated with Benetton clothing company to design the firm's first textile factory. Afra and Tobia Scarpa have been responsible for the interiors of the company’s Paris, Freiburg, and New York City offices. In 1973 they designed the \"Papillion\" lamp for Flos, one of the first lighting designs to use halogen technology. They also worked for Fabbian (lamps \"Saturnina\" 1998 and \"Galeto\" 2001), and Veas (metal lamp \"Scandola\") in the later part of their careers. From their first collaborations as husband and wife in the mid-1950s until the present day, their pieces have incorporated new technologies, while still maintaining history, form, and function. Afra and Tobia Scarpa have received the Compasso d'Oro in 1969 to the International Forum Design in 1992. Their furniture has been published in magazine articles like L'ŒIL. From 2004 to 2007, the couple collaborated on many restoration projects for historical buildings such as the Palazzo della Ragione in Verona, Italy. Since 2002, Tobia has taught in the Design Department of the Università Iuav di Venezia in Venice, Italy."

  "text" : "Alan Smolinisky (born November 28, 1979) is an American entrepreneur/investor who began his career in commercial real estate in the late 1990s while attending the University of Southern California. Smolinisky partnered with his landlord Brian Chen after observing a large shortage of student housing around USC. Together through their company Conquest Student Housing, they went on to build and renovate many buildings around the campus, eventually becoming the largest provider of private student housing at USC, and later at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Conquest became so dominant at USC that the University sued them under the Sherman Antitrust Act for \"monopolizing the student housing market around USC’s University Park Campus\". The company was sold to a private equity firm and publicly traded real estate investment trust in summer 2008 for $205 million. After a brief retirement, Smolinisky and Chen moved away from real estate and into public securities investment using funds received from the sale of their company. Smolinisky and Chen are value investors, an investment paradigm that derives from the ideas on investment that Benjamin Graham and David Dodd began teaching at Columbia Business School in 1928 that focuses on acquiring assets at less than their intrinsic value. Today, the movement is most closely associated with Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren E. Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles T. Munger. Today, Smolinisky and Chen manage their own personal investments (approximately $500 million total assets under management) from a small office in Pacific Palisades, California. Investments include a collection of retail shopping centers in Los Angeles, CA, a portfolio of 2,500+ units of affordable housing across 11 states, a portfolio of publicly traded securities, and a capital equipment leasing business."

  "text" : "Andrew Murray (1813–1880) was an Australian journalist. Andrew Murray was born in Scotland, and educated at the Andersonian University in Glasgow, and won prizes as an essayist. He emigrated to Adelaide in 1839, and founded a drapery business in Hindley Street (at that time Adelaide's foremost shopping precinct) with George Greig as Murray, Greig, & Co. Murray married Jessie Spence, sister of Catherine Helen Spence, in 1841. In 1841 the business failed, and Murray was able to find employment as a journalist with the Southern Australian, the second newspaper to be established in South Australia. In 1844 he purchased the Southern Australian from the proprietor, Richard Blackham, and was its editor and proprietor till 1852, when the exodus of workers to the gold-fields of Victoria severely strained South Australia's economy, and the South Australian, as Murray had renamed it, reverted from bi-weekly to weekly, then in July 1851 was forced to fold. Murray then migrated to Victoria, and worked as commercial editor with The Argus, and acted as editor in 1855 and 1856. He was subsequently the editor and proprietor of the (Melbourne) Economist. He published Murray's Prices Current and an almanac book, and also traded in wines, but was forced to declare insolvency in 1874. In the late 1850s Murray bought land in Boroondara, 10 km East of Melbourne. He named his house 'Balwyn' from the Gaelic bal and the Saxon wyn, meaning 'the home of the vine'. Balwyn Road and the suburb of Balwyn were named after it. The house was located on the site now occupied by Fintona Girls' School. He died at Waterloo (now Yarragon), Gippsland and is buried in Boroondara General Cemetery."

  "text" : "Arvo Kirkmann (born July 21, 1939) is an Estonian proverb scholar, “one of the leading paremiologists in the world.” He graduated from Tartu University’s Department of Estonian Philology in 1962. He stayed on there till 1969 as a researcher at the Literary Museum in Tartu. From 1970-1972, he did postgraduate studies there, then went on to work as a researcher at the Institute of Language and Literature, then the Institute of Estonian Language, and finally at the Estonian Literary Museum. He was part of the Tartu Paremiology Group, a group of scholar that did major work on not only Estonian proverbs, but cooperated on comparative work with other proverb scholars in the Balto-Finnic area, led by Matti Kuusi. He also worked with Matti Kuusi on the ‘’Proverbia Septentrionalia. 900 Balto-Finnic proverb types with Russian, Baltic, German, and Scandinavian Parallels’’ (1985). Also, he and Ingrid Sarv assembled the five-volume Estonian proverb collection ‘‘Eesti vanasõnad’’ (1980-1988). Krikmann has published many dozen items on proverb study. Since his native Estonia was under Soviet domination for much of his academic life, Krikmann’s access to proverb publications and outside scholars from outside of the Soviet shadow was limited. Academically, he was named “professor extraordinary” at Tartu University in 1992, then in 1997 was named to the Estonian Academy of Sciences. He has also been named to multiple boards and committees. Krikmann was honored by the 2014 volume of Proverbium dedicated to him as a Festschrift. He was honored by a symposium held in his honor in 2014. It was titled “Scala naturae:Symposium in honour of Arvo Krikmann’s 75th birthday” and was held at the Estonian Academy of Sciences in Tallinn."

He is political editor of the IMT's In Defence of Marxism website. Woods was a leading supporter within the Militant tendency within the UK Labour Party and its parent group the Committee for a Workers' International until the early 1990s. A series of disagreements on tactics and theory led to the expulsion from the tendency of Woods and Ted Grant, who founded the Committee for a Marxist International (soon renamed International Marxist Tendency) in 1992. They continued with the policy of entryism into the Labour Party. Woods has expressed particularly vocal support for the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela, and repeatedly met with the socialist President of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez (in office 1999-2013), leading to speculation that he was a close political adviser to the president."

The leadership of the movement was later handed down from Rabbi Adam to Rabbi Yisrael ben Eliezer, the Baal Shem Tov. The exact identity of Rabbi Adam is unknown. Since the name Adam was rare among European Jewry, Gershom Scholem considers it to be a pseudonym for Heshel Zoref (died 1700). According to Aryeh Kaplan, others identify this Adam with Rabbi David Moshe Abraham (whose initials are Adam) of Troyes or with Adam Zerweiker. Kaplan also writes that it may be an anonym to protect the subject's identity. According to Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, Rabbi Adam was a disciple of Rabbi Yoel Baal Shem of Zamość, who in turn was a disciple of Rabbi Eliyahu Baal Shem of Worms. According to the Shivhei HaBesht, Rabbi Adam found manuscripts in a cave, containing hidden secrets of the Torah. Rabbi Adam asked in a dream to whom should he hand down the manuscripts? He was answered to hand them down to Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer of the city of Okopy. Before his death, he commanded his only son, who was an eminent scholar, to search for the city with that name and hand the manuscripts to Israel ben Eliezer. After Rabbi Adam died, his son traveled until he arrived at Okopy, where he married the daughter of a wealthy man and eventually gave the manuscripts to the Baal Shem Tov."

He views pre-Islamic culture as a source for contemporary Pandit identity. Agnishekhar is the author of Kisi Bhi Samay (At Any Moment), a collection of poetry published in 1992. The book is organized into two sections: the 49 poems of \"Kram\" (\"Sequence\"), and the ten poems of \"Visthapit Kashmir\" (\"Displaced Kashmir\") which differ from \"Kram\" in being labeled by place of composition (always Jammu) and a date ranging from mid-1990 to early 1991. The poem \"Mahavipada\" (\"Great Trouble\"), from the \"Displaced Kashmir\" section, criticizes the camps into which displaced Pandits were settled. Agnishekhar also contributed to the screenplay for the \"Bollywood-style\" movie Sheen, which uses Pandit displacement as the context of a love story."

  "text" : "Agnieszka Biedrzycka is a Polish historian and writer from the Institute of History of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN). She obtained her doctorate in December 2002 from the Faculty of History of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland. Biedrzycka serves as research scientist and editor for the multi-volume Polish Biographical Dictionary (Polski Słownik Biograficzny) published by PAN incrementally. She is in charge of the History of Poland in the Early Modern era department. Since the 1989 return to democracy from under the Soviet-led totalitarian control, many distortions printed there have already been corrected. Her professional interest in research work gave impetus to the book about the history of Lwów in the Second Polish Republic before the invasion of Poland (front cover pictured), which was followed by the systematic destruction of the city's Polish heritage by the Soviet Union. Biedrzycka's interest in the Polish history of Lwów (now Lviv in sovereign Ukraine) going back in time is longstanding, and includes several books published in over a dozen of years. She wrote the Bibliografia pomników kultury dawnych kresów południowo-wschodnich Rzeczypospolitej (Kraków 2000), Korespondencja Stanisława Koniecpolskiego hetmana wielkiego koronnego (Kraków 2005), Pomniki epigrafiki i heraldyki dawnej Rzeczypospolitej na Ukrainie, vol. 1 (Kraków 2005), and most recently, Kalendarium Lwowa 1918–1939 (Kraków 2012)."

  "text" : "Arnold J. D'Ambrosa (born 1933) was an American Democratic Party official who served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1974 to 1976 from the 22nd Legislative District. His political career was cut short by scandal. The Rahway Democratic Municipal Chairman and the city's Director of Public Works, D'Ambrosa was elected Assemblyman in 1973, the beneficiary of the Watergate scandal that helped Democrats score massive gains in the legislative elections. D'Ambrosa and his running mate, Betty Wilson, defeated two Republican incumbents, Herbert H. Kiehn and Arthur Manner. He took office as an Assemblyman in January 1974. In July, he was arrested. Prosecutors charged him with selling an air conditioner owned by the City of Rahway for $600 and keeping the money. He was also accused of taking a $200 bribe from a contractor, as well as lying to a Grand Jury and misusing city assets (materials and employees) for work on his vacation home in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. He remained in office, but was not a candidate for re-election to a second term in 1975. In January 1976, just before the expiration of his term, he was sentenced to nine months in jail after admitting charges of embezzlement, bribery, perjury and official misconduct. Rahway fired him from his Public Works job. After prison, D'Ambrosa relocated to Point Pleasant, where he owns a nautical supply business. He is now a Republican and contributes to GOP candidates."

He was redistricted to the 13th district in 1973, and served until 1982. He is a former president pro tempore of the senate and is a member of the Democratic party. In 1981, he and Florida Representative Tom Bush successfully attached an amendment to the state budget that would deny funding to any state university that advocated sexual activity between unmarried adults.  Within months, Florida's Supreme Court unanimously ruled the provision an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment.  Shortly thereafter, several ethics allegations were made against Senator Trask,  and he resigned from office in July 1982."

Upon arrival in the Roman Empire, the Goths suffered from widespread famine, with some Gothic parents reportedly being forced to sell their children into slavery in return for rotten dog meat in order to avoid starvation. In 376, Valens' lieutenant Lupicinus invited Alavivus and Fritigern to a banquet to discuss provisions for their people, where Alavivus was assassinated. Fritigern on the other hand managed to escape, inciting a revolt which culminated with a decisive Gothic victory at the Battle of Adrianople."

  "text" : "Alayna Lutkovskaya (Russian: Алена Лутковская; born 15 March 1996) is a Russian pole vaulter. Lutkovskaya won gold medals at the 2014 World Junior Championships and at the 2013 European Junior Championships. Lutkovskaya has also won silver medal at the 2013 World Youth Championships. In her senior debut at the 2014 European Championships Lutkovskaya finished seventh. She jumped 4.45 m at the qualification and 4.35 m at the final. In February 2014 Lutkovskaya broke Russian junior indoor record when she jumped 4.50 m. The previous record was 4.47 m, set by Yelena Isinbayeva back in 2001. At the 2014 World Junior Championships Lutkovskaya jumped 4.50 m which equalled the World Junior Championships record set by Angelica Bengtsson in Barcelona 2012. At the same time Lutkovskaya also equalled the Russian junior outdoor record set by Valeriya Volik in 2008. In September 2014 European athletics announced that their panel of experts had judged the europeans who should be the nominees for the Golden Tracks awarded to the best European male and female Rising Stars in 2014. Alayna Lutkovskaya was one of the nominees alongside the likes of Mariya Kuchina and Katarina Johnson-Thompson. Most well known male nominees were Adam Gemili and Wilhem Belocian. At the end it was Kuchina and Gemili who were rewarded with the European Athletics Rising Star at the Golden Tracks ceremony in Baku. In February 2015 Lutkovskaya broke her own Russian junior indoor record when she jumped 4.54 m. In May 21, 2015 Lutkovskaya broke World junior outdoor record when she jumped 4.61 m. The earlier record was set only one day earlier when Robeilys Peinado had jumped 4.60 m. Lutkovskaya's jump of 4.61 m was the 3rd time in season 2015 when the previous World junior outdoor record of 4.58 m set by Angelica Bengtsson in 2012 was broken because also Nina Kennedy had broken the previous record when she jumped 4.59 m in February 2015. However Lutkovskaya's jump of 4.61 m is only World junior outdoor record because Bengtsson had jumped 4.63 m in indoor and that is also officially World junior record. Lutkovskaya has personal bests of 4.61 m (15 ft 1 1⁄4 in) outdoors and 4.54 m (14 ft 10 1⁄2 in) indoors. She was born in Irkutsk."

Since then, he has performed in cities such as Baden-Baden, Berlin, Monte Carlo, and Stockholm. Notable appearances include a 2012 appearance in Tosca, as Cavaradossi, at La Scala. In the same year he was seen as Otello at the Royal Opera House in London. In 2013 he appeared in the role of Radames in Aida at the Zurich Opera House. He followed that performance by appearing as Manrico in Il Trovatore at the Berlin State Opera. He has also performed in Turandot as Calaf at La Scala. In 2013, he appeared in the role of Ismaele in Giuseppe Verdi's opera Nabucco, conducted by Nicola Luisotti at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan as well as the Splendid Palace in Latvia. In 2014 he announced that he will perform at The Orchestra Hall in Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci. He will also appear as the title role in the Metropolitan Opera's new production of Otello, which will open the Met's 2015-2016 season. The production is notable within American opera circles due to the Met's decision to abandon their tradition of blackface for the role of Otello. Other future performances include Norma at the Bavarian State Opera, Otello at Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu, and Pagliacci at the Royal Opera House in London."

  "text" : "Amelia Muller Fay (1844 – November 9, 1928) was an American concert pianist, manager of the New York Women's Philharmonic Society, and chronicler best known for her memoirs of the European classical music scene. A pupil of Theodor Kullak, Fay traveled to Europe to study with Franz Liszt, eventually writing a comprehensive biographical sketch of the artist that can still be read today, as a part of the memoirs of her travels and studies in Germany. Fay was born in 1844 in Bayou Goula, Louisiana. She was the third of six daughters and the fifth of nine children of the Rev. Charles Fay and Emily (Hopkins) Fay of Louisiana and St. Albans, Vermont and Charles Jerome Hopkins's niece. Her sister, Rose Emily Fay, married Theodore Thomas. Amy Fay studied piano under Professor John Knowles Paine of Harvard and at the New England Conservatory of Music. From 1869 to 1875, she continued her lessons in Germany, where she studied with the most prominent teachers of Europe; pianists Carl Tausig, Theodor Kullak, Franz Liszt, and Ludwig Deppe. Deppe's technique for piano revolutionized her playing and served as the method she herself was to use for her students in the years to come. See: List of music students by teacher: C to F#Amy Fay. On returning to Boston, Fay became well known for her piano \"conversions\": recitals preceded by short lectures. She moved to Chicago and New York, where she was associated with the Women's Philharmonic Society of New York. She died on November 9, 1928."

  "text" : "Augustus William Harvey (May 31, 1839 – February 7, 1903) was an industrialist and politician in Newfoundland. He served in the Legislative Council of Newfoundland from 1870 to 1895 and represented Harbour Grace in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1900 to 1904 as a Liberal. He was born in Bermuda and was educated at the University of Pennsylvania. Harvey came to Newfoundland in 1853. In 1861, he joined Dunscombe, Harvey and Company, later known as Harvey and Company; his uncle Eugenius Harvey was part owner of the firm. When his uncle left, he became managing partner. Originally a fishery supply business, the company expanded into mining, lumber and manufacturing. He was also a partner in A. Harvey and Company and the New York, Newfoundland and Halifax Steamship Company. In 1894, he became an agent for the Dominion Coal Company of Cape Breton. Harvey established the Cabot Steam Whaling Company in 1896. In 1864, Harvey married Elizabeth Walker. In 1870, Harvey was named to the Newfoundland Legislative Council. He was opposed to union with Canada and supported the construction of a railway across the colony. He served as chairman of a committee tasked with deciding how Newfoundland should set up a fisheries commission; he later became chair of the commission. In 1889, he was named to the Newfoundland cabinet, responsible for the fisheries commission. From 1893 to 1896, he was head of the fisheries ministry. Harvey resigned from the Legislative Council and the cabinet in December 1895. This was in part due to the collapse of the Union and Commercial banks in 1894; Harvey had been a director for the Union bank as well as a major client of the bank. In 1900, he was elected to the Newfoundland assembly and he served in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio. Harvey helped establish the Fishermen and Sailors’ Home in 1886. He was also a member of the committee set up to help Doctor Wilfred Grenfell provide medical care in Labrador. He died in St. John's at the age of 63."

He became the first foreign-born Editor-in-Chief of the Columbia Law Review. Despite his short time in the United States before his untimely death in 1946 at the age of 44, he left his mark on modern United States jurisprudence, his work advocating and foretelling the role social sciences would come to play in deciding legal issues. Pekelis died in a plane crash in Ireland, at age 44. After his death, his scholarly works and theories were discussed by the Karl E. Meyer, Max Ascoli and Milton Konvitz among others."

He married a schoolteacher in 1910, with whom he had six children, and he held the occupation of a clerk. Having volunteered for the Bersaglieri at the age of 18, he served in the 11th Regiment during the Italo-Turkish War and First World War, eventually attaining the rank of captain. On April 4, 1920, Padovani enrolled in Benito Mussolini's Fasci organization. In 1921, Padovani emerged as the Fascist chief for the city of Naples. A charismatic figure, signups increased under his administration, and candidates sponsored by the Fascists fared disproportionately well in Naples in the 1921 election. He participated in Mussolini's October 1922 March on Rome and quickly became a prominent figure in the South thereafter, exercising supreme authority as the Ras of the Campania region. Just as quickly, however, internal rivalries and tensions increased. Padovani was an exponent of the left wing of fascism, and he criticized the party for becoming too bourgeois at the expense of workers' interests. An avowed republican, he also disliked Mussolini's overtures to the Italian monarchy. Padovani was also associated with Freemasonry, which Mussolini opposed, and so Padovani was made to give up his ties to that organization in February 1923. Padovani opposed political compromises such as the merger with the Nationalists, seeing such moves as betrayals of fascism's \"revolutionary\" origins. This proved to be his undoing, as the Nationalists still held significant sway in the countryside, and a former Nationalist in the Neapolitan region, Paolo Greco, had important friends in business. On May 19, 1923, Padovani was compelled to resign so Greco could take his place. Padovani continued to protest his loyalty to the Fascist Party, and he was later reinstated, though he never returned to public office. The dramatic and peculiar circumstances surrounding his death were reported in foreign media. Stepping out onto the balcony of his home to greet a throng of admirers, the balcony inexplicably collapsed, killing Padovani and eight others. Foul play has long been suspected, as Padovani's lingering popularity and influence were a probable source of unease on Mussolini's part. Thousands turned out for Padovani's funeral. In 1934, Piazza Santa Maria degli Angeli in Naples was renamed Aurelio Padovani Square and a huge monument was erected bearing his name. After World War II, the square's name was reverted and the monument was dismantled, its fate forgotten until 2010 when its remains were found in the Bourbon Tunnel."

The accounts for the church in Ubby Church near Kalundborg indicate that a craftsman from Roskilde created the pulpit there. It was very probably Nielsen Hatt, especially as it coincides with his style. The pulpit in Smørum Church is said to be the work of Brix Michgell's workshop in Roskilde but the figures of the Evangelists are certainly Nielsen Hatt's. The altarpiece in Tuse Church is said to be his work and he is thought to have contributed to the altarpiece in Smørum. The pulpit in St Jørgensbjerg Church in Roskilde is also thought to be the work of Nielsen Hatt, as is the pulpit in Svinninge Church."

He married Mathilde Lucie Haas and together they collected 333 works from the Northern and Southern Netherlands that became notable as a collection between World War I and World War II. They held a gallery at salon Adolphe Schloss residence 38, avenue Henri Martin, Paris. After Adolphe's death there, his collection became the property of his wife Lucie, who died in 1938 and the collection was left to their children Marguerite, Henry, Juliette and Lucien. They moved the collection to Chambon for safekeeping during the war, where it was looted by the Vichy government in 1943. Of the 333 objects, only 230 were actually offered to the Hitler museum and 49 were saved for France and given to the Louvre. After the war all were lost, but gradually 148 objects could be rediscovered."

  "text" : "Archer Taylor (August 1, 1890 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) was a seminal proverb and riddle scholar and folklorist. He enrolled at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, graduating with the BA and MA in German by 1912. He then taught German at Pennsylvania State College. He went on to Harvard University, receiving his Ph.D. degree in German with a dissertation on the fairy tale motifs in the Wolfdietrich epics. At Harvard, he studied under such famous scholars as Kuno Francke, George Lyman Kittredge, John Albrecht Walz, Hans Carl Gunther von Jagemann, William Henry Schofield, Charles Hall Grandgent, and F.N. Robinson. From them he developed interest in such fields as German literature, Germanic philology, Scandinavian studies, Romance languages, Celtic and, folklore in general. In 1915 Taylor began teaching German at Washington University in St. Louis, eventually being promoted to professor. He moved to the University of Chicago in 1925. By 1927 Taylor had become the Chairman of the Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures. He married his childhood sweetheart Alice Jones on September 9, 1915 and they had three children. He lost her June 16, 1930, while they lived in Chicago. He later married Dr. Hasseltine Byrd, who became his second wife on June 17, 1932. They had two children. In 1939, they moved to California where he served as Professor of German Literature and Folklore at the University of California at Berkeley, as Chairman of the Department from 1940 to 1945. While in California, they built a home in the Napa Valley, where they hosted many folklorists. While in California, he worked as a journal editor, for California Folklore Quarterly (which he helped found) (now Western Folklore) and the Journal of American Folklore. In 1965, Archer worked with his Finnish friend Matti Kuusi to establish the journal Proverbium. His publications were numerous, included work in medieval literature, philology, folklore, bibliography, etc., eventually totalling over four hundred books, monographs, articles and notes in America and Europe. His most famous work was The Proverb (Cambridge, MA 1931), which contains his most famous quote, \"the definition of a proverb is too difficult to repay the undertaking... An incommunicable quality tells us this sentence is proverbial and that is not\" (The Proverb p. 3). Though Taylor's contribution to the studies of proverbs is better known, his contribution to the studies of riddles is also significant. \"Archer Taylor ... among modern folklorists has contributed most to riddle scholarship.\" Taylor died on September 30, 1973."

  "text" : "Adrian Johnston is a Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque and a faculty member at the Emory Psychoanalytic Institute in Atlanta. Johnston is one of the most widely followed philosophers writing today. Influenced by Žižek and his readings of German idealism, Johnston’s work has gained many readers among those making the materialist and realist turns in Continental philosophy. Johnston’s books are guided by his “transcendental materialism,” which in sum calls for a materialist ontology that nevertheless does not reduce away the gap or figure that is human subjectivity. Johnston argues for retooling Freud and Lacan after the success of the natural sciences in recent decades, but argues that both Freud and Lacan presaged a lot of these successes. Critical of the thinkers of immanence whom he believes, following Hegel, can only give us subjectless substance, Johnston’s work has brought Lacanianism into the 21st century when many wrongly claimed it died long before the end of the last. Johnston is the author of Time Driven: Metapsychology and the Splitting of the Drive (2005), Žižek’s Ontology: A Transcendental Materialist Theory of Subjectivity (2008), Badiou, Žižek, and Political Transformations: The Cadence of Change (2009), and Prolegomena to Any Future Materialism, Volume One: The Outcome of contemporary French Philosophy (2013), all published by Northwestern University Press. He is the co-author, with Catherine Malabou, of Self and Emotional Life: Philosophy, Psychoanalysis, and Neuroscience (Columbia University Press, 2013). Johnston's most recent book is Adventures in Transcendental Materialism: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers (Edinburgh University Press, 2014) with Todd McGowan and Slavoj Žižek. He is also a co-editor of the book series Diaeresis at Northwestern University Press."

  "text" : "Arthur L. \"Art\" Haywood is a Pennsylvania politician. A Democrat, he is currently the Pennsylvania State Senator for the 4th district. Prior to being elected to the State Senate in the 2014 election, Haywood practiced law and served as a commissioner in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania.Haywood was a Marshall Scholar at the London School of Economics.For more than 25 years, Art Haywood devoted his career to public interest law, working to ensure fair and affordable housing in the Philadelphia region, fighting foreclosures and advising non-profits with the goal of revitalizing underserved neighborhoods.Raised by his mother, a public school teacher, Art grew up in Toledo, Ohio, where he attended public schools with his sister, Leslie. From his childhood, Art was instilled with the values of hard work and education. Art began working at the age of nine as a delivery boy and continued to work through his graduation from Morehouse College, when he received a prestigious Marshall Scholarship to attend the London School of Economics. After graduating from law school at the University of Michigan, Art began offering legal services to low-income families at Regional Housing Legal Services and Community Legal Services.Later, Art focused his private practice on representing organizations focused on community revitalization through the improvement of education and affordable housing. He also served as legal counsel to Esperanza, a community development organization in the Hunting Park section of North Philadelphia. “I feel it’s not just enough for me to care: I have to act on that caring. And I’ve seen what power there is in leveraging the collective caring of residents willing to join me in making change. I continue to harness the power of collective caring in our community to take actions that will lead to the quality public education, fair wages, and safety our families deserve.”Art has served on the boards of a number of organizations, including the Tenant Union Representative Network and Cheltenham Achievers Network. He has provided pro-bono services to the National Association of Katrina Evacuees and many other organizations. As a result of his work in the community, Art has been recognized by the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, Christian Legal Aid Society, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and John Marshall Fair Housing Institute. Through his work with NAACP legal Defense Fund, Art met his wife, Julie Billingslea, married in 1989, and moved from Germantown to Cheltenham in 1994, in order to ensure their children received a better quality public school education. The experience of being forced to move to give his children a better education, and the housing discrimination he experienced in the process, reinforced Art’s will to work towards a Pennsylvania where a quality education and fair housing is available to everyone. Most recently, Art served as a Cheltenham Township commissioner. Julie currently serves as Vice President of the Cheltenham Township school board. Haywood became the first elected official from Pennsylvania to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States."

After a courtship of four to five years, she married Ernest Stoehr, who remained her husband until his death in 1998 at the age of 97. They bought a farm in 1941. She described her life on the farm as \"a lot of work to do, sun up to sun down. Had a garden and milked cows, had chickens, canned everything. That's how we fed the family.\" She lived independently until April 2013, when she moved into an assisted living home. In the last year of her life she registered a Facebook account, but could not register with a birth year before 1905. To create the account she was obliged to state an age of 99. She complained to the social media website, and they sent her 114 flowers for her 114th birthday. After a few days of hospice care, she died on December 21, 2014, at the age of 114 years, 67 days. According to the Gerontology Research Group she was the oldest person living in Minnesota, the seventh oldest in the United States, and the thirteenth oldest in the world."

  "text" : "Art Uytendaal (Adrianus Uytendaal) is an Australian equestrian. Uytendaal was born in Holland in 1931 and immigrated to Australia in January,1956. He was one of seventeen living children, coming from an equestrian family in Breda, Holland. Because he was made professional in his homeland, he decided to spend two years in Australia as an assisted migrant, returning as an amateur, but ended up staying for a lifetime. He was one of the first riders to use the 'European' style in Australia and introduced dressage as the basis of show jumping. From 1956 to 1990 Art's list of wins numbered into the thousands in Australia. He was the first sponsored rider in the country -Kevin Dennis Show Jumping Team and also Johnny Walker Whisky. The list of wins includes three Australian Show Jumping Championships, Victorian Championships, Showjumper of the Year awards, and many Puissance records. Some of the his well-known horses, that he made or rode were Solo, Bencubbin, Donald, Madison Square, Powder, Trafalgar Square, Leal, Chatter, Gentleman, Brahmin, Tongala, Jamaica Inn, Mr. Kevin, Mr. Dennis, Wanganella, Autograph, Koyuna, Dixieland, Johnny Walker Whisky, Mr. Ed, Duell Bug, Duell Roy and Man of Gold (who competed for Japan at the Sydney Olympics.) He was the first to jump 1 m 93 cm (6' 4\") in a Puissance in Australia and in 1969 he jumped 2 m 17 cm (7' 1½\") on Chatter, a record he held for many years until the rules were changed and the wall could include hay bales in front of it. He would have qualified to ride at five Olympic Games, but being professional he was ineligible. Two of his horses, Mr. Dennis finished 5th at the Montreal Olympics ridden by Guy Creighton, and Autograph ridden by Geoff McVean finished 4th at the alternate Olympics in Rotterdam. His first wife Marianne Uytendaal (later Gilchrist) was also an accomplished rider representing Australia on numerous occasions. In 1976 he took two young horses to the UK - Tongala and Jamaica Inn where they both won and placed in shows, qualifying for the Horse of the Year Show, but unfortunately Art was injured and returned home. He was the Australian coach of the World Eventing Championships in Gawler, South Australia, nominated coach for the ill-fated Moscow Olympics and also Los Angeles Olympics."

Dwyer served as co-director of the 2012 Institute on Collaborative Language Research (CoLang 2012), with Carlos Nash. CoLang, formerly known as InField, is an international training workshop in field linguistics and language documentation supported by the National Science Foundation. Dwyer conducts research into the languages and cultures of Inner and Central Asia, especially languages in the Turkic, Sinitic, and Mongolian families. She has published pedagogical and linguistic materials for the Uyghur language. Her research is significant in arguing for the areal significance of Chinese Inner Asia as a Sprachbund, a region of language convergence. Her research also looks at issues of language death. In 2014, this work led to her being named a Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation."

In 1982, he won the table tennis singles event at the Commonwealth Table Tennis Championships (in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia), before partnering with Sunday Eboh to take the doubles gold in the same discipline. Along with Francis Sule, Atanda, again, won the table tennis doubles gold medal at the 1985 Commonwealth Games. In 1991, with Bose Kaffo as partner, he won the Commonwealth Games' Mixed Doubles event for table tennis. Arguably one of the best table tennis players to contest out of Africa, Musa's backhand play, and the loop associated with it remains his pièce de résistance. 10-time African Men's Table Tennis Singles Champion, Atanda Musa currently lives and coaches table tennis in the United States of America."

He is a partner in merchant bank, Charterhouse Capital Partners: coincidentally, one of his professional rivals is a descendent of the first Marquess' adversary, Napoleon Bonaparte. In 2005 he married makeup artist and fashion model Jemma Kidd, great-granddaughter of Lord Beaverbrook. Since 2014, following the succession of his father as Duke of Wellington he is now known by the courtesy title of Marquess of Douro. Lord and Lady Douro have twins and a younger son: \n*  Lady Mae Madeleine Wellesley (born 4 January 2010) \n*  Arthur Darcy, Earl of Mornington (born 4 January 2010) \n*  Lord Alfred Wellesley (born 10 December 2014) Lord Douro is the heir apparent to the Dukedom of Wellington and to the titles Prince of Waterloo and Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo. The first two titles can only be inherited in the male line, while the last can also devolve upon the holder's daughters."

After some short experiences in Neapolitan papers (initially at the Don Marzio, then at Il Mattino), he moved to Turin, where he was music critic for La Stampa from 1919 to May 1967. He brought the music journalism in Italy to a level of «professionalism hitherto unknown». In Turin, Della Corte also taught history of music, both at the Conservatory (1926–53) and at the University (1939–53). His main interests were the comic opera of the 18th century, Gluck and Verdi. Della Corte wrote many essays and articles, and 35 books, published both in Italy and abroad, many of them considered of fundamental importance for the modern musicology, characterised by a severe musical judgment and by the attempt to innovate the world of the Italian musical studies. He was a member of important musical and cultural institutions (Accademia dei Lincei, Accademia dei Cherubini in Florence, Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, Istituto Italiano per la Storia della Musica). Della Corte died in Turin on 12 March 1968, aged 84. The city of Turin dedicated to Andrea Della Corte the music section of the Civic Library, to which his family, after his death, donated over 15,000 books."

  "text" : "Alfred Nicholson Leeds (9 March 1847 – 25 August 1917) was an English amateur palaeontologist. He was born at Eyebury, Peterborough, the youngest of the eight children of Edward Thurlow Leeds (1802–51) and Eliza Mary Leeds (née Nicholson). He was educated at Warwick Grammar School. He had wanted to become a doctor, but circumstances meant that from 1868 he had to take on the management of Eyebury Farm (in The Fens, and historically attached to Peterborough Abbey) as a gentleman farmer. His elder brother Charles, a student at Oxford University, had been encouraged by Professor John Phillips to persevere in collecting fossils from near his home. Alfred joined him in these searches, and between them they developed better methods of disinterring, and of scientifically recording, fossils in soft clay than had been used before. (They rewarded the workmen at the clay pits (which served a brickworks in Fletton, Peterborough) for not doing so themselves, but instead sending notice to Eyebury.) In 1887, Charles emigrated to New Zealand; but Alfred continued to search for fossils, assisted by his wife and by their second son, Edward Thurlow Leeds (1877–1955, Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum 1928–45). He amassed one of the largest collections of fossil vertebrates in the world. In 1889, his portrait was painted by the 17-year-old William Nicholson. From 1890 onwards, he began to present his most important specimens of Jurassic fossils from the Oxford Clay near Peterborough to the British Museum. He was a Fellow of the Geological Society; in 1893, he was awarded part of its Lyell Fund. Other museums in the UK and elsewhere hold items from his collection; including the National Museum of Ireland. An extinct genus of fish, Leedsichthys, and several extinct species have been named in his honour."

  "text" : "Sven Arne Runeberg (7 April 1912 — 15 November 1979) was a Finnish anthropologist and linguist, best known for his studies on magic, witchcraft, and sociolinguistics. Arne Runeberg was born in Helsinki into the Swedish-speaking cultural family Runeberg; his great grandfather was Finland’s national poet J. L. Runeberg. Arne Runeberg attained his B.A. degree at the University of Helsinki in 1939, but World War II made a stop to his postgraduate studies. In 1947, however, he was the first student to defend his doctoral thesis, Witches, Demons and Fertility Magic, at the new Faculty of Social Sciences in Helsinki University. Representing evolutionary anthropology, Arne Runeberg was trained by two students of Edvard Westermarck, namely Gunnar Landtman and Rafael Karsten. After his doctoral degree, Arne Runeberg had a versatile career at several colleges in Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, including London School of Economics (1961) and Umeå Social College (1964–1971). The last tenure was at his alma mater, as he was appointed the associate professor of social anthropology in Helsinki (1971–1979). In addition to his doctoral thesis, Arne Runeberg wrote two substantial studies: Jesu korsfästelse i religionshistorisk belysning (1952) situates Jesus Christ in a long tradition of so-called carnival kings, and Some Observations on Linguistic Patterns in a Bilingual Society (1951–1954) discusses bilinguality. Runeberg himself was a bilingual Finn par excellence, using both Swedish and Finnish. Arne Runeberg died in Helsinki, aged 67, soon after he was retired from the University."

  "text" : "Alfred Thorp Stirling CBE (8 September 1902 – 3 July 1981) was an Australian diplomat. Stirling was the eldest of three children of Australian surgeon Robert Andrew Stirling and his second wife Isabella Jessie Matilda Oades-Thorp, a nurse from England. He graduated from the University of Melbourne (BA, 1922; MA, LL.B, 1924) where he excelled in French and won a W. T. Mollison scholarship for studying at University College, Oxford. He received his bachelor's degree there in 1927 and then worked as assistant to Robert Menzies in Melbourne. The two eventually became lifelong friends, and when Menzies became attorney-general he appointed Stirling as his secretary (1934–36). Stirling joined the Department of External Affairs in Canberra, where he headed the political section for a year. In 1937 he was sent to London as a liaison officer with the United Kingdom, and stayed there through World War II. In the meantime he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1941. After the war (1945–46) he became high commissioner in Ottawa, where he fully employed his knowledge of French. In 1947–1948, he was for fifteen months the minister in Washington, United States, and in 1948 appointed as high commissioner to South Africa. After becoming Prime Minister in 1949 Menzies sent Stirling to the Netherlands, where he served as Australian Ambassador from 1950 to 1955. While staying there Stirling helped soften the Dutch position to the territorial claims of Indonesia, and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1953. After that he was ambassador to France (1955–59), Philippines (1959–62), Italy (1962–67) and Greece (1964–65). For his diplomatic services he received Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (1963) and Order of George I of Greece (1964). He retired in 1967, declined a knighthood, and returned to Melbourne, where he wrote seven books in the 1970s. He died in 1981 in East Melbourne and was buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery. Stirling never married, and in his early diplomatic assignments was accompanied by his mother and sister Dorothy."

  "text" : "Alejo Alvarez (c. 1890s – c. 1940s) was a Filipino track and field athlete who competed in the shot put and discus throw events. Alongside Regino Ylanan, he was the most successful throws athlete at the Far Eastern Championship Games. Alvarez competed in two editions of the competition. At the 1917 Tokyo Games he won the shot put with a throw of 10.69 m (35 ft 0 3⁄4 in) and was runner-up in the discus to compatriot Rafael Montes with a mark of 31.10 m (102 ft 0 1⁄4 in). He returned at the following edition in Manila in 1919 and completed a throws double for the host nation. He won the discus with a throw of 32.20 m (105 ft 7 1⁄2 in) and defended his shot put title with 11.38 m (37 ft 4 in) – the first time a man cleared eleven metres at the event. This made him one of Asia's foremost throws athletes at the start of the 20th century. He was one of only a dozen track athletes to win three or more individual titles during the history of the Far Eastern Championship Games, which was the first major multi-sport event in Asia and a forerunner to the Asian Games. He was killed in the Philippines during World War II, defending against the Japanese invasion."

  "text" : "Alfred Potter (15 December 1827 – 21 September 1878) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University in 1849. He was born in Ilkeston, Derbyshire and died at Nottingham. Potter was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a tail-end batsman and a bowler; his batting and bowling styles are not known. Playing for Cambridge against the Marylebone Cricket Club, he took five wickets in the MCC second innings, though the complete figures are not recorded. That led to his selection for the 1849 University Match against Oxford University, which Cambridge won narrowly and in which he took two wickets. That was his final game of first-class cricket. Potter graduated from Cambridge University in 1850 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was ordained as a priest in the Church of England and served as a curate at Mablethorpe, Skirbeck and Ropsley, all in Lincolnshire. From 1860 to his death in 1878 he was rector of Keyworth, Nottinghamshire and from 1876 he combined that post with being rector of Stanton-on-the-Wolds as well."

  "text" : "Allan Burnett (born Glasgow, 12 January 1925, died New Zealand, 10 October 2007) a Scottish anarchist activist. He was a member of the Glasgow Anarchist Federation in his youth. When, in 1943, he resisted conscription to the British forces during the Second World War, he was sent to Glasgow’s Barlinnie Prison and later to Slateford Prison, Edinburgh as one of 61.000 British conscientious objectors. At his trial at Glasgow Sheriff Court he said that “I refuse to be pitchforked or led into slaughter, like so much human manure, or to be duped into the lunatic butchery of my comrades and fellow workers of other geographical spheres who are like-wise enslaved in a system of organized misery imposed on them by their respective ruling classes.” After his prison sentence he moved to London and spent time in a number of communes. He also travelled to France and Italy. Shortly after his marriage, he moved to New Zealand where he lived for the rest of his life, never returning to Scotland. Prior to moving to New Zealand Burnett worked as a shipwright and insurance clerk. In New Zealand he initially worked as a shipping clerk and a bank officer before running his own business in the building trade. In the 1970s he was employed by Auckland City Council as a housing inspector. He was active in the Worker’s Educational Association and held the association’s public speaking trophy in the mid 1970s. Throughout his life he wrote poetry, the subjects of which ranged from politics, in particular his libertarianism, to his love of the outdoors. He died on 10 October 2007. Allan Burnett’s writing remains unpublished. Some of his work, letters to friends and family, photos, poems and other documents pertaining to his life are archived by the Spirit of Revolt Archive, Glasgow."

He performed live with Sparks during the 'Kimono My House' tour of the UK in 1974. Following his dismissal from Sparks, Fisher joined Mike Patto's band Boxer in 1977, recording the album Absolutely for Epic Records. Other members of the band were ex-Grease Band keyboard player Chris Stainton, ex-Vanilla Fudge/Cactus bassist Tim Bogert, and drummer Eddie Tuduri. In the late 1980s he moved to Thailand and worked as a musician in Lamai Beach in Ko Samui and in Bangkok. In 1999 he was featured in the BBC documentary Expats. He died on 31 March 2000 following a performance in Ko-Samui; the official cause of death was myocardial infarction."

Stell worked for more than a decade at the start of his career at Columbia Pictures (1943–1955 credits), which was a major Hollywood studio in that era. Among his most noted films are Touch of Evil (directed by Orson Welles-1958), To Kill a Mockingbird (directed by Robert Mulligan-1962), and Silent Running (directed by Douglas Trumbull-1972). Touch of Evil, which was directed by Orson Welles, proved difficult for Stell; he was not the initial editor but instead chosen for re-editing, and he noted that Welles became \"ill, depressed, and unhappy with the studio's impatience\" in the process. Stell had been selected as a member of the American Cinema Editors. He was nominated for the American Cinema Editors Eddie award for To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). He was also nominated for Eddies for his television work on an episode of Ben Casey (1961) and on the mini-series Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones (1980). In 1996 he shared the American Cinema Editors Career Achievement Award with Desmond Marquette."

The son of Henrik Berlin (1704–1781) and his wife Anna Catharina Hellström (1711–1799), Berlin matriculated at Uppsala University 13 February 1765 and studied there with Carl Linnaeus in 1767-68 and with professor of medicine Jonas Sidrén in 1768–1769, before travelling to London with a Stiegler fellowship, to find a botanical expedition he could join. In the meantime he assisted Sir Joseph Banks and Banks's assistant Daniel Solander, another of Linnaeus' \"apostles\". In 1773 Berlin travelled to Guinea with the English botanist Henry Smeathman. The purpose of the expedition, which was sponsored by members of the Royal Society, was to explore the central parts of West Africa but prior to reaching the mainland, Berlin died of a stomach illness while on the Îles de Los. Before his death, Berlin managed to send a few plants to Linnaeus."

  "text" : "Aud Solveig Gustad, née Lund Olsen (1 May 1917 – 30 April 2000) was a Norwegian trade unionist and politician for the Communist and Socialist Left parties. She was born in Trondheim as a daughter of worker Jens Valdemar Lund Olsen (1894–1970) and cleaner Jenny Oline Emilie Hansen (1896–1966). She was active in the Norwegian communists' pioneer movement from 1930, and from 1935 to 1939 she was active in the Young Communist League of Norway. She finished her secondary education at Trondheim Cathedral School in 1937 and started as a journalist in Ny Tid in the same year. After a stint as telephone worker from 1938 until 1944 she briefly returned to Ny Tid in 1945. The Second World War was over, and she briefly served in the Communist Party women's committee. In 1939 she had married worker Helge Kristian Gustad. She left the workforce for some years, but was hired as a receptionist in Phoenix Hotell in 1951. In 1955 she went on to become a bookkeper for Bladcentralen. Here she was elected as the local union leader (Union of Employees in Commerce and Offices) in 1961. From 1969 to 1970 she changed job to assistant at the Social School, and chaired the Trondheim branch of the progressive women's league Norsk Kvinneforbund. From 1970 to 1977 she was a secretary in the Norwegian Heart and Lung Patient Organization regionally. In the Norwegian local elections, 1971 Gustad was elected as a deputy member of Trondheim city council; and full member in 1975. In the meantime she had become a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway from Sør-Trøndelag, elected in 1973. After a little less than two years, the regular representative Kai Øverland died and Gustad replaced him. He took a seat in the Standing Committee on Standing Committee on Social Affairs. In 1977 she withdrew from electoral politics to move to Oslo and work as a secretary for the Norwegian Heart and Lung Patient Organization nationwide. From 1984 to 1991 she was a board member of the Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People. However, she served as a bnational board member of the Socialist Left Party from 1979 to 1981 and member of their committee on social policy from 1979 to 1983.
