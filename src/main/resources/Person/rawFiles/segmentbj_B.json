  "text" : "Banana Freckle is a disease caused by the fungus Guignardia musae (telomorph) or Phyllosticta musarum (anamorph). Generally, the causal agent of disease is referred to as Guignardia-Phyllosticta sp. There are several different strains of the fungus that exist to infect different banana varieties around the globe. Symptoms include yellowing of the tissue and formation of small dark brown spots on the leaves and fruit. Within the spots, conidia or pycnidia can be found. Banana Freckle is easily propagated and spread from plant to plant by rain splash and movement of infected tissue or fruit. Management of the disease consists of cutting out infected leaves, the paper bag method, fungicide application, and proper sanitation techniques. This devastating disease is extremely relevant for the major banana exporting countries of the world. In the absence of chemical control, there is about a 78% yield loss. Banana Freckle disease needs to be carefully monitored in order to prevent further spread of the disease."

  "text" : "Beatrice Fenton (July 12, 1887 – February 11, 1983) was an American sculptor and educator born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She is best known for her whimsical fountains. Inspired by the painter Rosa Bonheur, she decided to become an animalier and began drawing animals at the Philadelphia Zoo. Her father, Dr. Thomas Hanover Fenton, an art patron and head of the Art Club of Philadelphia, was impressed with the drawings and showed them to a family friend, Thomas Eakins. Eakins found the drawings “too flat” and suggested that she “get some clay and mold it.” Fenton enrolled in a sculpture class taught by A. Stirling Calder in 1903, and her future direction was set. From 1904 to 1912, she studied with Charles Grafly at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. There she met Marjorie Martinet and Emily Clayton Bishop. Her relationship with Martinet lasted more than fifty years, and included the exchange of passionate letters. Fenton succeeded Samuel Murray as Instructor in Sculpture at the Moore College of Art and Design (formerly the Philadelphia School of Art for Women), teaching there from 1942 to 1953. Works by Fenton were shown at PAFA's annual exhibition most years from 1911 to 1964, and she was awarded the George D. Widener Memorial Gold Medal in 1922 for Seaweed Fountain. She was a member of the National Sculpture Society, and her Nereid Fountain was featured in the NSS exhibition of 1929. A cast of Seaweed Fountain has been in the Brookgreen Gardens collection since 1934.

According to Bir, he was born shortly after the Crimean War in 1856, the son of landowner Guhi Maaji. A cattle rancher in the village of Khanar, near Kathmandu, Chaudhari was purportedly a leader of the first land survey team in the area, conducted in 1888. Chaudhari rose to prominence in the mid-1990s when Nepalese television and press began reporting on his advanced age. In 1997, he was honored by Nepal's king Birendra. Chaudhari had a son and a daughter, with his first wife, both of whom predeceased him, and a daughter with his second wife who as of 1996 remained alive at age 68. At the time of his death, in 1998, he had four grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren."

  "text" : "Rabbi Yisroel (Israel) ben Eliezer (born circa 1700, died: 6 Sivan 5520, 22 May 1760), (Hebrew: רבי ישראל בן אליעזר‎‎) often called Baal Shem Tov (/ˌbɑːl ˈʃɛm ˌtʊv/ or /ˌtʊf/) or Besht, was a Jewish mystical rabbi. He is considered to be the founder of Hasidic Judaism (see also Mezhbizh Hasidic dynasty). The Besht is better known to many religious Jews as “the holy Baal Shem” (der heyliger baal shem in Yiddish), or most commonly, the Baal Shem Tov (בעל שם טוב). The title Baal Shem Tov is usually translated into English as “Master of the Good Name,” but at least two other translations are possible: \n*  \"Good Master of the Name,\" taking \"Baal Shem\" as a unit, meaning one who \"owns the [holy] name\" therefore has the power or uses Divine names to cure illnesses and perform miracles. I.e., an effective baal shem. \n*  \"One who has a good reputation in the community,\" since in Hebrew idiom, \"Baal\" can mean \"one characterized by\" and \"Shem\" can mean \"reputation,\" thus \"one characterized by a good reputation.\" The name Besht (בעש\"ט) — the acronym from the words comprising that name, bet ayin shin tet—is typically used in print rather than speech. The appellation “Baal Shem” was not unique to Rabbi Yisroel ben Eliezer; however, it is Rabbi Yisroel ben Eliezer who is most closely identified as \"The Baal Shem Tov\", as he was the founder of the spiritual movement of Hasidic Judaism. The little biographical information that is known about Besht comes from oral traditions handed down by his pupils (Jacob Joseph of Polonnoye and others) and the legendary tales about his lifeand behavior which were collected in Shivḥei ha-Besht (In Praise of the Ba’al Shem Tov; Kapust and Berdichev, 1814–15). The attitude of the Hasidim towards these legends is a blend of suspicion and belief. The Rebbe Shlomo of Rodomsk pithily declared, \"Whoever believes all the miracle stories about the Baal Shem Tov in Shivhei HaBaal Shem Tov is a fool, but whoever denies that he could have done them is an apikoros [a heretic].\" Similarly, the Rebbe Mordechai of Neshkiz explains, \"Even if a story about him never actually occurred, and there was no such miracle, it was in the power of the Baal Shem Tov, may his memory be a blessing for the life of the World-to-Come, to perform everything.\" Nevertheless, from the numerous legends connected with his birth it appears that his parents were poor, upright, and pious. When he was orphaned, his community cared for him, while at school, he distinguished himself only by his frequent disappearances. Many of his disciples believed that he came from the Davidic line tracing its lineage to the royal house of King David, and by extension with the institution of the Jewish Messiah."

He was a right-arm leg-spin bowler who batted right-handed. Garudachar made his first-class debut in November 1935, playing for Mysore against Madras in the 1935–36 edition of the Ranji Trophy. He made regular Ranji Trophy appearances over the following decade, primarily for Mysore, but also for the United Provinces and Bombay. Playing for the United Provinces against Central India in January 1940, he took 6/30 and 4/59, giving him a maiden first-class ten-wicket haul. For Mysore in the 1941–42 Ranji Trophy, Garudachar took 34 wickets from just four matches, finishing as the competition's leading wicket-taker and helping the team to its only appearance in the tournament final. His season included figures of 6/46 and 5/78 against Hyderabad, 6/56 and 8/99 against Madras, and 5/68 against Bengal. As a batsman, Garudachar's highest score (and only century) came for Mysore against Holkar in the 1945–46 Ranji Trophy, when he was captaining the team. After Holkar scored 912/8 in its first innings (with five individual centuries), Mysore were bowled out for 190, and made to follow on. Garudachar, who had taken figures of 4/301 from 69 overs as a bowler, then made 164 runs in just over four hours, helping his team to 509/6 at the end of the final day. The match was his final Ranji Trophy appearance, but he continued playing first-class cricket into the early 1950s. His final game at that level was in October 1950, when he appeared for the Cricket Club of India against a touring Commonwealth XI. After retiring from playing, Garudachar remained involved with the Mysore State Cricket Association (later known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association) in administrative roles. He worked as an engineer, having graduated from the Benares Engineering College. Garudachar died in Bengaluru in February 2016, aged 99. At the time of his death, he was believed to be the oldest living Indian first-class cricketer."

  "text" : "Bert Moorhouse (sometimes incorrectly billed as Bert Moorehouse) (November 20, 1894 – January 26, 1954) was an American character actor whose career began at the very tail end of the silent era, and lasted through the mid-1950s. Born Herbert Green Moorhouse in Chicago, Illinois in 1894, he would enter the film industry in 1928 with featured roles in two FBO productions: Rough Ridin' Red, and the Hugh Trevor vehicle Hey Rube!. He would appear in either featured or small roles in over 130 films during his 26 year career, as well as more than 200 other pictures in which he appeared as an extra. In 1954 he had small roles in three films, the last of which to be premiered was Dangerous Mission, which starred Victor Mature, Piper Laurie, William Bendix, and Vincent Price. All three of these films were released posthumously. Moorhouse was suffering from a severe illness, and on January 26 he would take his own life, via a gunshot wound to the head. He was buried with his mother, Fannie, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California."

On June 21-22, 1870, Big Tree led a raiding party on an attack on Fort Sill in Indian Territory, but the raid wasn't successful as the previous one led by White Horse. On 9 July 1870, the Kiowa Indians, eventually being Big Tree one among the leaders, made a raid into Montague County, Texas. They scattered a herd of cattle, killed two yoke of oxen, stole nine horses, one mule, a large amount of provisions, one tent, one wagon-cover, etc., all of which property was at the time owned by and in the possession of Colonel Samuel Newitt Wood."

Her books are devoted almost entirely to history of Pomerania with special focus on the World War II atrocities committed against ethnic Poles by Nazi Germany during Operation Tannenberg. Bojarska began her scientific career at the Institute, as the research aid to Profesor Karol Pospieszalski in 1958–1966, director of the Research Department of History of Nazi Occupation of Poland (Zakład Badania Dziejów Okupacji Hitlerowskiej w Polsce). She was traveling between Potsdam and Magdeburg, collecting data about the fate of Poles during the genocidal Intelligenzaktion Pommern. Since than, she wrote numerous publications on the subject widely cited by Polish as well as German historians. Her first ground-breaking research into the Massacres in Piaśnica was published in 1964 when still little was known about it. Her subsequent Piaśnica monograph was released by Zakład Ossolineum in Wrocław in 1978 and since reprinted several times."

Fink earned a BSc degree in 1887 and a Master's degree in 1894 from the University of Illinois, and then went on to do graduate work at Harvard University, where he received the Master of Arts degree in 1896. Fink started teaching at Upper Iowa University in 1892, and in 1903 became professor of Botany at Grinell College. Three years later in 1906, Fink began a position as headship of Botany at Miami University, where he worked until his death in 1927. Several lichens have been named in his honor, including the species Calosphaeria finkii, Dermatina finkii, Patellaria finkii, and the genus Finkia. The standard author abbreviation Fink is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

  "text" : "Baye Pewhairangi Riddell (born 1950) is a New Zealand ceramicist, composer and musician of Ngāti Porou and Te Whānau-a-Ruataupare descent. Riddell was born in Tokomaru Bay in 1950 and began working with clay in the early 1970s, while living in Christchurch. His early work fits within the contemporary movement in New Zealand craft pottery, largely influenced by the Anglo-Orientalism of Bernard Leach and Japanese potters who were influential in New Zealand, such as Shoji Hamada. Riddell, who had become distant from his Māori heritage, started putting Māori motifs on his pots, and in 1974 he became a full-time potter, the first Māori artist to commit to this profession. Riddell built his first kiln in Christchurch at this time, but soon moved back to the North Island, living in Central Hawkes Bay and Anaura Bay before settling in Tokomaru Bay in 1979. Here he sold work through a cooperative founded by Helen Mason, who introduced him to other potters, including Barry Brickell, Harry Davis and George Kojis as well as the artist Theo Schoon. Through his aunt, Ngoi Pewhairangi, who was working to revive traditional Māori art and culture, Riddell also reconnected with his own heritage. Through the resurgent contemporary Māori art movement at this time Riddell connected with other Māori clay artists, including Colleen Waata Urlich and Manos Nathan and spent time working alongside them at workshops and hui (meetings). In 1986, with Manos Nathan, Riddell was a co-founder of Ngā Kaihanga Uku, the national Māori clayworkers’ organisation in Aotearoa New Zealand. In 1989 he and Nathan were awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to establish an exchange with Native American artists. In 2011 he was awarded the Creative New Zealand Craft/Object Fellowship."

Smith attended Smith College, earning a bachelor's degree there in 1962 and later earning a Ph.D from the University of Rochester in 1976. She has since held fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Historical Studies at Princeton University, the American Council of Learned Societies, the National Humanities Center, and the University of Rochester. Smith also designed a project, co-sponsored by the Organization of American Historians, to integrate the study of women into survey courses. She has been on the board of editors of French Historical Studies, a consulting editor to Feminist Studies, and on the board of associate editors for Journal of Women’s History. Her primary focus began with the histories of the French Empire in the post Industrial age. Since then, Smith's research interests concern issues of Cultural Hybridity in the Modern West, Gendering Disability, Women's and Gender History in Global Perspective, Europe in the Twentieth Century World, and Women in World History."

  "text" : "Benjamin Sylvester Ruffin, Jr. (December 11, 1941 – December 7, 2006), also known as Ben Ruffin, was an African American civil rights activist, educator, and businessman in Durham, North Carolina. Growing up during the Civil Rights era, Ruffin’s life experience in Durham has provided him with a black consciousness that helped him analyze and empathize with the difficulty of growing up poor and black in America. This thus motivated, shaped and developed Ruffin’s role as an activist, propelling him to assume leadership positions within organizations that ensured social justice and access to opportunities for blacks in the Jim Crow South. Through cultural cohesion, Ruffin created a bridge between his world of black Durham and that of white Durham, integrating minorities to a bigger presence within the Durham community. He achieved success against difficult odds of bridging racial gaps through tackling the role of poverty, effectively bringing better housing, employment opportunities, and educational access to black citizens."

Later, during Chu's collapse due to civil war, Bian was able to enter its territory and, for some time, secured the nominal submission of all of its territory for his emperor Li Jing. However, he was unable to deal with subsequent uprisings in the Chu realm and had to abandon it, causing him to be exiled for some time. He also fared poorly when later returned to the army, as he was defeated and captured by Later Zhou forces when Later Zhou invaded Southern Tang and eventually forced its submission as a vassal.

  "text" : "Budd Fine (September 10, 1894 – February 9, 1966) was an American character actor of the silent and sound film eras. Born Budd Nathen Fine on September 10, 1894, in Hartford Connecticut, Fine served in the US Army during World War I, during which he was awarded a Purple Heart. Fine broke into the film industry in a film short in 1924, Aggravatin' Papa, and would make his feature film debut later that year with a small role in the silent film, Hold Your Breath. During the silent film era, he would make mostly shorts, with only a handful of appearances in feature films, including Buster Keaton's Battling Butler (1926), and as a soldier in the Cecil B. De Mille's 1927 epic, The King of Kings. With the advent of the talking picture, Fine began to work steadily in feature films. He would have small roles in many notable films, such as: the first talking version of Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, 1931's A Connecticut Yankee, starring Will Rogers; Les Misérables in 1935, starring Fredric March and Charles Laughton; Anything Goes (1936), starring Bing Crosby and Ethel Merman; William Dieterle's 1939 version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, starring Charles Laughton; the Cary Grant and Jean Arthur vehicle, Only Angels Have Wings, directed by Howard Hawks; another Grant film in 1943, also starring Laraine Day, Mr. Lucky; the classic film noir, Lady in the Lake (1947), starring Robert Montgomery; the 1947 Bob Hope comedy, also starring Dorothy Lamour, My Favorite Brunette;. The 1950s would see Fine reunite with De Mille, on his epic film, Samson and Delilah (1950), starring Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr; he would also appear that year in the musical, Annie Get Your Gun, starring Betty Hutton and Howard Keel. He appeared in over 100 films, including over 80 feature films."

The Times Literary Supplement states that in 'The Religion of the Falun Gong' Penny “makes a good case for defining Falun Gong as a modern Chinese religion. . . . [He] provides an admirable guide to the short history of Falun Gong and the eclectic complexities of its doctrine, which he sets within the framework of indigenous religious belief over the centuries.”"

He was at Cambridge University from 1867 but did not make his first-class cricket debut until 1869, when he opened the innings as a right-handed batsman in four matches. He achieved no great success in 1869, but was picked for the University Match against Oxford University, in which he scored 5 and 0. In 1870, Preston played a further four matches for the university side, not always as an opening batsman, and against the Gentlemen of England team he scored 24 and 28, the two best innings of his first-class career. But he was not picked for the 1870 University Match and he did not play first-class cricket again after this season, although he featured in minor matches for amateur sides, including Suffolk, through to 1885. Preston returned to Lowestoft after leaving Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1871; he became a brewer in the town and was also a Justice of the Peace. He was married three times."

In the late 1940s, he wrote several plays, two of which were turned into films. By the early 1950s, Schubert moved to the small screen, producing television series and movies during that decade. Some of the series he worked on were Mr. and Mrs. North, Topper, and Adventures of the Falcon. Schubert died on August 4, 1988, in Los Angeles, California."

  "text" : "Baba Dioum (born 15 October 1937) is a Senegalese forestry engineer. In a paper presented in New Delhi in 1968, at the triennial meeting of the General Assembly of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), Dioum made the much anthologised statement: \"In the end we will conserve only what we love, we will love only what we understand, and we will understand only what we are taught.\" His major concerns have been agricultural development and natural resource management. Dioum was born in Dahra, in a rural region of Senegal. As a youth he attended Koranic school in Dahra and worked in the fields. His father sold groundnuts and cattle to the French. He later studied at a regional primary school in Linguère, then at the École Blanchot in Saint-Louis and the Lycée Van Vollenhoven in Dakar. After graduation, he studied natural sciences at the University of Dakar before moving to France to continue those studies at the Sorbonne. He completed his education at the École nationale des eaux et forêts in Nancy, from which he received his Diplôme d'Ingénieur des Eaux et Forêts (diploma of water and forestry engineering). In 1967, Dioum became Director General of Water and Forestry in Senegal, a post he held until 1973. From 1974 to 1980 he served as chief executive officer of the Société Nationale de Fourrage (SONAFOR). From 1981 to 1995 he was Director of the Agricultural Policy Unit in the Senegalese Ministry of Agriculture. Since 1991 he has acted as Coordinator General for the Conference of West and Central African Ministers of Agriculture, which he helped to organise while working in the Senegalese ministry. He has served on the boards of directors of the International Food Policy Research Institute and the International Fertilizer Development Center."

He was Sultan of the Middle Juz. He is a son of Tursun Khan and great grandfather of Alikhan Bukeikhanov. Barak Sultan was notable for having murdedred his rival beheading the first Kazakh Khan in Kazakh history who took citizenship of Russia - Khan of Junior Juz Abulkhair Khan. It was revenge for Abulkhair Khan's pro-Russian policy and the last point was the alleged robbery of a caravan laden with gifts from Barak Sultan to the ruler of the Khanate of Khiva during attacks by Abulkhair Khan against the Karakalpaks, who were also under Barak Sultan's rule. One of his wives was a daughter of Galdan Tseren. During that marriage and until the death of Galdan Tseren in 1745 the war and conflicts between Kazakh Khanate and Dzhungaria had been stopped. As a descendant of Genghis Khan Barak wanted to become the ruler of two Turkic-Mongol states - Dzhungaria and Kazakh Khanate. Barak Sultan and his eldest son had been poisoned by a pro-Russian agent from Middle Juz in 1750. The death of Barak Sultan opened opportunities to expand Russian Empire over the Kazakh Steppe."

  "text" : "Margaret Constance Belsky née Owen, better known by her nom de plume Belsky, (20 June 1919 - 26 January 1989), was a British cartoonist and illustrator. Belsky was born on 20 June 1919 in Wareham, Dorset to Albert Edward Owen and Margaret Constance Davies-Bunton. She attended the Bournemouth School of Art and later studied engraving and illustration at the Royal College of Art. Belsky won a cartoon competition for Punch in the 1930s. It was at the Royal College of Art that she met her future husband, Czech exile and sculptor, Franta Belsky. Franta introduced her work to editors he knew at the magazine Lilliput, where Belsky became a regular contributor. In 1944, Margaret and Franta married, with Belsky taking on her husband's name for her single word signature, disguising her gender. Belsky started working for the Daily Herald in 1951 and became their first ever pocket cartoonist, at the same time becoming the first woman to draw a daily front-page cartoon. Belsky was dismissive of her own work, calling herself \"just a hack.\" She didn't collect her work, though it was estimated that she may have drawn more than 6,000 cartoons while working for the Daily Herald. When the Daily Herald, later The Sun, was taken over by Rupert Murdoch in 1969, Belsky refused to work for him. Instead she contributed cartoons for many other newspapers and magazines, including The Strand Magazine, Punch, The Guardian, John Bull and Sunday Graphic. She also became an illustrator for children's books, including designing the covers for various Penguin books. Belsky died on 26 January 1989."

  "text" : "Bob DeNatale, also credited as Robert DeNatale, is a filmmaker, film editor, professional butoh dancer, and former Marvel editor/writer. Bob DeNatale first entered the creative scene as an editor and writer for Marvel Comics. Starting in 1983 and continuing through 1991, DeNatale edited The Amazing Spider-Man, The Spectacular Spider-Man, and Marvel Team-Up. Although editing Spider-Man was his primary focus, during his time at Marvel, DeNatale also wrote for Dazzler, and edited Marvel Super Special #34, an adaptation of the Sheena, Queen of the Jungle film. Following his departure from Marvel Comics, DeNatale focused on his career in butoh, the avant-garde Japanese dance art. In 1992, DeNatale founded the Flesh & Blood Mystery Theater to spread the art of butoh. Performing throughout the United States, Flesh & Blood Mystery Theater was a regular participant in the San Francisco Butoh Festival of which DeNatale was an Associate Producer. DeNatale's other butoh credits include performing in the film Oakland Underground (2006) and touring Germany and Poland with Ex…it! ’99 International Dance Festival. During the late 1990s, DeNatale co-founded the performance group XSX with former members of the bands Vivisection and Her Majesty the Baby. He later served as the lead singer for the punk art band Kill The Messenger from 1986 to 1989. In the 2000s, DeNatale's creativity embarked on a new path as he began working in film. His first film, a short entitled Prospect Park, Cleaning (2009), featured three butoh dancers improvising on a sunny day in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. His second short, Tales of Creation (2011), which questioned whether hearing voices was God, the Devil, or insanity, was an Official Selection of the 2011 New Filmmakers New York Festival. DeNatale's third project, The Art of Dreaming (2013), was a Semi-Finalist of the 2013 Moondance International Film Festival. DeNatale is currently working on his first feature film, Kim."
