He specialized in Urartian research, and was co-author of Corpus Inscriptionum Chaldicarum, a corpus of Urartian inscriptions. After receiving a degree in law at the University of Göttingen (1883), his focus turned to the history of ancient cultures — about which, he obtained a second doctorate from the University of Berlin (1886). Afterwards, he served as a research assistant in the Egyptology department at the Royal Museums of Berlin. In 1893 he obtained his habilitation and started work as a lecturer in ancient history. During his time spent at Berlin, his influences were Otto Hirschfeld, Friedrich Delitzsch and Theodor Mommsen. In 1898/99 he took part on an expedition to Armenia, where he performed extensive studies of Urartian inscriptions. In 1901 he was named an associate professor of ancient history at the University of Berlin. He later travelled to England, where in 1911 he became a professor of Greek history at the University of Liverpool, followed by an appointment as a representative to the chair of ancient history at the University of Oxford (1913/14). In 1915/16 he was a professor of ancient history at the University of Constantinople. In 1918 he relocated to Innsbruck, where he taught classes until 1935. In 1901 he became the first editor of Klio. Beiträge zur alten Geschichte, a journal of ancient history that he continued to edit until 1936."

  "text" : "Claus Elsborg Olesen (born August 21, 1974 in Galten, Skandenborg) is a retired Danish sailor, who specialized in two-person keelboat (Star) class. He represented Denmark in the Star class in two editions of the Olympic Games (2004 and 2012), and also shared bronze medals with his partner Michael Hestbæk at the 2012 Star World Championships in Hyères, France. Olesen has also been training throughout most of his sporting career for Kaløvig Bådelaug Yacht Club in Århus. Olesen made his official debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where he paired up with Nicklas Holm in the Star class. On August 16, 2004, Olesen had almost been injured and charged in an automobile accident, when his partner Holm struck and killed a British pedestrian while speeding in his car on the way to witness the Danish handball team's prelim match. Being overshadowed and cleared by the accident charges, the Danish duo recorded a net score of 83 points to establish a satisfying ninth-place finish in a fleet of seventeen boats, trailing behind Bermuda (led by four-time Olympian Peter Bromby) by a single mark. Eight years after competing in his last Olympics, Olesen qualified as a 38-year-old veteran and a crew member for the Danish squad in the Star class at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London by placing third and receiving a berth from the World Championships in Hyères, France. Teaming with his new partner and four-time Olympian Michael Hestbæk in the opening series, the Danish duo occupied an eleventh spot with a net score of 89, missing out a chance to compete for the medal race by nine points behind French sailors Pierre-Alexis Ponsot and Xavier Rohart."

  "text" : "Claudio Uberti is an Argentinian government official who attained political power through personal ties to the former President Néstor Kirchner, becoming head under Kirchner of El Órgano de Control de Concesiones Viales (OCCOVI), the federal agency that regulates highway concessions. During his tenure at OCCOVI, Uberti was also a key figure in the arrangement of trade deals between Argentinian and Venezuelan firms under the Néstor Kirchner and Hugo Chávez administrations. He was described at the time as a sort of “parallel” ambassador from Buenos Aires to Caracas, and was an intimate of both Kirchner and Chávez. Uberti gained prominence a result of the 2007 Maletinazo or “suitcase scandal,” in which a suitcase containing nearly $800,000 was seized by Buenos Aires airport police from a passenger on a diplomatic flight of which Uberti was in charge. As a consequence of this seizure, Uberti was ultimately charged with smuggling, money laundering, and the solicitation of bribes. Charges against him were eventually dropped, although an FBI probe concluded that Uberti had been transporting an illegal campaign donation from Hugo Chávez to Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. His nicknames are “Pachi” and “Ubi.”"

Two roads in the estate, Charlesville and Reedville, are named after him. In 1852–54 he was president of the Liverpool Architectural Society. In addition to designing buildings locally, Reed also carried out works further afield, including in North Wales, the Lake District, and Lytham, Lancashire.

Pol was born in Berkenrode, a small town of about ten Catholic families that is now part of Heemstede. He probably learned to draw in the tavern there known as the Dorstige Kuil, where the artists Simon Fokke, John Greenwood, Jan Punt and others from the Amsterdamse Tekenacademie would meet during the summer months. The historians Roeland van Eynden and Adriaan van der Willigen devoted six pages in their dictionary of artists to him. He first trained in Antwerp where he learned \"sieraad schilderen\", or decorative painting. Here he met Gerrit Malleyn and Cornelis van Spaendonck and through him, Gerard van Spaendonck and Jan Frans van Dael. He then travelled with them to Paris in 1782 where he at first spent time making decorative arabesques and painting flower arrangements in miniature on snuffbox lids. He became a good friend of Van Dael, who he stayed close to the rest of his life. Like Van Dael, he created oil paintings in the manner of Jan van Huysum, of which his best piece was shown in 1809 and another in 1814. He also made designs for the Gobelins Manufactory and his considered a pupil of Van Dael because of similarities to his work, though he was much older than him. He spent the last years of his life teaching. Pol died in Paris and Pierre-Louis Dagoty bought his largest flower piece."

  "text" : "Carlo Biotti (1901 – 10 December 1977) was an Italian judge, the President of the Court of Milan and a Magistrate of the Supreme Court of Cassation. His forced recusal from the case brought by the widow of Giuseppe Pinelli against the police commissioner Luigi Calabresi in 1971 became a cause célèbre. Biotti was the presiding judge in the case brought by the widow of Giuseppe Pinelli against the police commissioner Luigi Calabresi. Calabresi had led the investigation into the Piazza Fontana bombing. Pinelli died in mysterious circumstances during a police interrogation following the bombing. On 27 May 1971, Biotti was recused at the request of Calabresi's lawyer, who claimed that in a private conversation Biotti had admitted he was supporter of the left wing militant group Lotta Continua. It was a claim that Biotti vehemently denied. Calabresi's attorney sought the recusal when Biotti ordered that Pinelli's body be exhumed. Neither Biotti nor his two fellow judges were convinced that Pinelli had died from falling from the police station window. His forced recusal not only prevented the exhumation of Pinelli's body, but delayed the investigation for two years. Biotti fought for years to clear his name and in November 1974 was completely exonerated by the Court of Florence. He died three years later at the age of 76. In the 2012 film Piazza Fontana: The Italian Conspiracy, the character of Carlo Biotti is played by Bob Marchese. From 1964 Biotti was also a director of A.C. Milan."

  "text" : "Charles F. Erhart (born 1821 in Ludwigsburg as Karl Erhart – 1891) was a German chemist who immigrated to the United States. Erhart co-founded with Charles Pfizer, his cousin and future brother-in-law Charles Pfizer & Company. Like his cousin, Charles Pfizer, was born in Ludwigburg, Germany. Three years older than his cousin, Erhart had mastered the confectioner's trade in his native town, and their skills blended well for the new business they founded together in Brooklyn, New York, in 1849. Chas. Pfizer & Co. produced fine chemicals, specializing in the compounding of chemicals not commonly made in America. Awards came early to the partners—from the American Institute in 1867 and the Centennial Exposition of 1876 in Philadelphia—whose first product, santonin, neatly combined the skill of Erhart, the confectioner, with that of his cousin, the chemist. The medicine, shaped like a candy cone, blended the bitter santonin with a sugar-cream confection to make it palatable. Erhart maintained close ties with Germany, returning to his homeland both for social and business reasons. During one trip, Erhart proposed to Fanny Pfizer, the sister of his cousin Charles Pfizer, and then married her in New York in 1856. This union further strengthened the familial ties of the growing business partnership. Erhart's scientific and technical skills were instrumental in bringing about an expanded line of chemicals and a much larger manufacturing plant. The Company's extensive connections in Europe enabled it to branch out into production of food-processing ingredients. In 1863, Erhart and Pfizer began importing crude argols — the tartar deposits formed in wine casks during the aging process—from France and Italy and set up their own refining operation for the manufacture of tartar and tartaric acid, which was used by bakers, beverage manufacturers, and in cooking. Sales began to climb, and by 1871, revenues of the young company were about $1.4 million. Erhart died in 1891, at the age of 70. Upon Charles Erhart death, their partnership agreement stipulated that upon the death of one partner, the surviving partner could buy the other’s share of the partnership for half its inventory value. Pfizer promptly exercised this option, paying his partner’s heirs $119,350 for Erhart’s half of the business. However in 1900, Pfizer distributed the stock of the company as follows: Charles Pfizer Jr. (334 shares), Emile Pfizer (333 shares), William Erhart (333 shares)."

The theft was unsuccessful when Cyrus and Dick missed the rendezvous having been captured with stolen mules. George buried half the money. The other half was turned over to the law by Carter, but George, having been killed in the capture, never revealed the location of the other $40,000 in gold which presumably remains hidden in the Trinities. Cyrus Skinner escaped imprisonment with Rattlesnake Dick there and again in Auburn, California."

Young was posthumously promoted to the rank of Sergeant. Cornel Young Jr. is commemorated with an elementary school named after him and a scholarship fund in his name."

  "text" : "Charles Dashwood Goldie (26 March 1826 – 11 January 1886) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University fleetingly in 1846. He was born in Paris, France and died in St Ives, then in Huntingdonshire. Some sources give the year of his birth as 1825. Goldie graduated from Cambridge University in 1847 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. He was priest in charge at High Toynton, Lincolnshire in 1851 and then from 1852 to 1866 he had the same position at St Thomas's Church, Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire. From 1866 to his death he was vicar of St Ives. Goldie's tenure at St Ives was controversial and his \"ritualistic proceedings\" alienated many of the congregation; he also attempted to impose church rates and was consistently and successfully opposed on that and on his candidates for the post of churchwarden in \"stormy\" parish meetings that attracted hundreds of people. Goldie's first-class cricket career was accidental. In the 1846 University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford University, held at Oxford, the Cambridge batsman John Walker did not appear for the match; the Cambridge team batted one man short in the first innings, but Goldie was co-opted to bat at No 11 in the second innings, and scored one run. Goldie married Harriet Nicol, the daughter of a Bengal Army colonel, in 1848; among their children was John Goldie, who won fame in rowing at Cambridge and at Henley and after whom the Goldie second string Cambridge University rowing team is named."

  "text" : "Calvin Edouard Ward, born April 19, 1925, is an African-American concert pianist, music theorist and educator. He was born in Atlanta, GA and educated at Morehouse College, Northwestern University and the University of Vienna in Austria.The second child and first son of Effie Elizabeth Crawford Ward (graduate of Spelman College, where she was a classmate of Alberta Williams King, mother of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, and sewing instructor at Atlanta's Evening School) and Jefferson Sigman Ward (graduate of the Haynes Institute in Augusta, GA, World War I veteran, Pullman porter and small businessman), Ward demonstrated musical prowess, including the ability to memorize tunes, from two years of age. As a four-year-old kindergartner at Atlanta's Oglethorpe School, he attracted his teacher's attention when he played the hymn \"Just as I Am\" in thirds on the classroom toy piano. He began formal music lessons when he entered first grade and within a year was playing complete sonatas. By age ten, Ward was accompanying the church choir and performing throughout Atlanta. After graduating from high school, Ward studied piano at Morehouse College, then served for two years in the United States Army, rising to the rank of sergeant chaplain's assistant. Resuming music studies, he earned Bachelor of Music in pipe organ performance in 1949 and Master of Music in choral performance in 1950. Ward taught at Florida A&M University and served as University Organist from 1950-1951. Ward received a Fulbright Fellowship to study organ at the Staatsakademie und Hochschule für Musik und darstellende Kunst in Vienna, Austria, and earned his Doktorat in Musical Research from the University of Vienna in 1955. Ward taught at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana from 1957 to 1958, and was chair of the Department of Music and Fine Arts at South Carolina State College from 1959 to 1961. He taught at Kingsborough Community College in New York for two years. From 1968 to 1972, he conducted the choir and chaired the Department of Music at the Tuskeegee Institute. He taught music theory, applied organ and African-American classical music at the Peabody Conservatory of Music at Johns Hopkins from 1972 to 1977, and later taught as an adjunct at the University of Maryland at Baltimore and at Coppin State College. In 1977, a Fulbright-Hays fellowship provided the opportunity to do research in Paris, France and Lambaréné, French Equatorial Africa. Ward was a guest lecturer at Cuttington University College in the Republic of Liberia in 1979, and was a Phelps-Stokes African-American Exchange Scholar at Kenyatta University College in Nairobi, Kenya. In 1986 he became the first Fulbright fellow to both lecture and perform. He was the first African-American visiting professor and co-conductor of the choir at the State Conservatory of Music in Vilnius, Lithuania and the first American guest conductor/lecturer of the Ave Sol Choir at the State Conservatory of Music in Riga, Latvia. He was the first American to perform on the Riga Cathedral's renowned Walcker pipe organ. Ward traveled to the St. Petersburg State Conservatory in the USSR, where he lectured in African-American classical composers, and to St. John's Theological College in New South Wales, Australia in 1990. In 1998, he accompanied the Street Theatre Dance Ensemble on piano in concerts at the Island Center for the Performing Arts in St. Croix, Virgin Islands. Ward administered music activities for the Trenton, NJ public school system from 1991 to 1995, and conducted vocal music workshops for teachers and students. After retirement, Ward continued to play organ at special occasions and to play an active role in the Willingboro, NJ community."

  "text" : "Charles W. Wason (1854 - 1918) was an engineer, Orientalist, philanthropist and bibliophile. Wason was born on April 20, 1854 in Cleveland. His father was a banker. After schooling at the Guildford Academy, he studied for a degree in mechanical engineering at Cornell University from 1872 to 1876, returning to Cleveland after his graduation to take a job with the East Cleveland Railway Company. He rose through the ranks to eventually become president of the Cleveland, Painesville & Eastern Railway Company, as well as running other utility companies. Wason developed a deep interest in China after he and his wife visited the country in 1903. This interest persisted, and after Sarah Pike Conger's Letters From China was given to him six years later by his wife's mother, he devoted himself to collecting English-language works on China. He began to amass a considerable collection, but ill-health forced him to turn over the acquisition of new items to his friend Arthur H. Clark. Clark, a publisher by trade, expanded the collection by around 9,000 volumes, including works in Chinese, French, Spanish and Portuguese. A ballroom in Wason's house, decorated with Chinese imagery, was converted into a library for the collection. Wason died on April 15, 1918, less than a week before his 64th birthday. His collection was bequeathed to his alma mater, Cornell University. His will also stipulated an endowment of $50,000 for the acquisition of new titles for the collection."

  "text" : "Sir Charles Hutton (August 20, 1861 – February 1, 1949) was a musician, educator, business owner and politician in Newfoundland. He represented St. John's East in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1894 to 1897 as a Liberal. The son of George and Eliza Hutton, he was born in St. John's and was educated at Saint Bonaventure's College, at St. Dunstan's College and at the French college at St. Pierre. He later studied music in England for three years around 1900. Hutton began work as a bookkeeper for Hearn & Company in 1879 and then, in 1883, opened a musical supply business. Until 1894, he ran the business out of his home. In 1880, he became organist and choirmaster for the Roman Catholic cathedral in St. John's. He taught music at Saint Bonaventure's, St. Patrick's Hall and Holy Cross School in St. John's. Hutton also was director for concerts performed by boys from the Mount Cashel Orphanage. He was also co-founder and conductor for the St. John's Choral and Orchestral Society. Hutton published the Newfoundland Folio of Over Fifty Old Favourite Songs in 1906. His student and protégé Ignatius Rumboldt became a prominent musician in St. John's. Hutton was elected to the Newfoundland assembly in an 1894 by-election. In 1903, he married Antonia \"Tony\" D'Alberti. The couple had four children. He was named a knight in the Order of St. Gregory the Great in 1924 and was named to the Order of the British Empire in 1938. Hutton died in St. John's at the age of 87."

  "text" : "Christopher Michael Sgro is an American political strategist best known for his work advocating for LGBT rights in North Carolina. In 2016, Sgro was appointed by Democrats in Guilford County to the North Carolina House of Representatives to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Ralph C. Johnson. He has been the executive director of Equality NC since 2013. Sgro has been one of the most vocal opponents of North Carolina's House Bill 2, a controversial North Carolina law which he has called \"the worst anti-LGBT legislation in the nation.\" He has often publicly clashed with the governor over the impact of House Bill 2, demanding its full repeal. A native of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, Sgro graduated from American University with a bachelor's degree in political science. Sgro was formerly director of economic development for US Senator Kay Hagan and a member of the senator's senior staff, a position which he held for more than four years and which took him to 97 of North Carolina’s 100 counties. Prior to that, he was one of the first staffers hired by Hagan to work on her successful 2008 U.S. Senate campaign. Prior to his work with Hagan, Sgro worked in the Washington, D.C. headquarters for America Votes, a 501 (c)4 organization that aims to coordinate and promote progressive issues, and CARE, a national anti-poverty organization. Additionally, Sgro managed Don Vaughan’s successful N.C. Senate campaign in 2008. Sgro also worked extensively on Jamie Raskin's successful primary bid to defeat the then president pro tem of the Maryland State Senate in 2006. Sgro lives in Greensboro, North Carolina and is married to Ryan Butler. The couple had a marriage ceremony in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2006, but became legally married in North Carolina on October 10, 2014, where they were the second same-sex couple to receive a marriage license in Guilford County, North Carolina."

During his term Marikkar aimed to set up a Sri Lankan telephone parts factory with Japanese help to provide cheaper telecommunications service. Marikkar was a skilled orator who often worked the crowds before public appearances of party chief Bandaranaike. He enjoyed publicity and in 1959 rode to a party convention on the back of an elephant, creating a diversion from the criticism of the Bandaranaike government. Marikkar was accused of bribery on 17 counts, also by a corrupt Buddhist monk. He went on to clear himself from all accusations."

Breaking the social customs of racial obstacles, he advocated for certification of African American medical students. He also became a member of many professional colleges including the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine and the American College of Surgeons. He served as chief of surgery at Durham's Lincoln Hospital and was later one of the key figures in converting it to the Lincoln Community Health Center, a low-priced clinic for the poor."

  "text" : "Charles C. Manger III, M.D. is a board certified Ophthalmologist in Laguna Hills, California. He has specialized in LASIK surgery since 1996 and his practice is dedicated to LASIK. Dr. Manger is also board certified in Refractive surgery by the American College of Eye Surgeons. Dr. Manger is the founder of Saddleback Eye Center, is the only LASIK surgeon at this facility, and has performed over 76,000 LASIK procedures since 1996. Dr. Manger graduated from Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii. He was then appointed to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland by Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii. Charles Manger graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with honors, majoring in Mathematics and Nuclear Science. After serving in the United States Navy, he received an honorable discharge and completed pre-medical studies at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He then attended medical school at the University of Southern California (Los Angeles, California) where he served as Student Body President for one year. Upon graduation from the Keck School of Medicine of USC, Dr. Manger completed a one-year Internship and three year Ophthalmology Residency at the County Hospital of Los Angeles and the Doheny Eye Institute. Upon graduating from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Charles Manger served in the Nuclear navy under the direction of Admiral Hyman Rickover. He was an Engineering Division Officer on a Polaris Missile Nuclear submarine, the USS Nathan Hale (SSBN-623), and he also served as the Assistant Weapons Officer and Assistant Navigator on the same submarine. Operationally, Charles Manger earned the “gold dolphins” as an officer qualified in submarines, and he was a qualified Officer of the deck and Diving Officer. Dr. Manger founded Saddleback Eye Center, a fully accredited Ophthalmology Clinic and Ambulatory Surgery Center in Laguna Hills, California in 1987. Initially, Dr. Manger was a general ophthalmologist specializing in Cataract surgery. In the early 1990s, Dr. Manger took a special interest in Refractive surgery (including Radial keratotomy and Automated lamellar keratoplasty) to help patients become independent of their need for eyeglasses and contact lenses. Since 1996, Dr. Manger has devoted his practice to LASIK (Laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis). Dr. Manger is a member of numerous professional organizations, including The American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS), the International Society of Refractive Surgery (ISRS), the American Board of Eye Surgeons (ABES), the American Medical Association (AMA), the California Medical Association (CMA), the Orange County Medical Association (OCMA) and the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO). Many industry leaders consider Dr. Manger to be an expert in the LASIK field. Dr. Manger has performed over 76,000 LASIK procedures since 1996, and is the only LASIK surgeon at Saddleback Eye Center. Dr. Manger has documented the success rates of his surgical outcomes, and consistently 99.7% of his LASIK patients see 20/20, 20/25 or better (the other 0.3% of his patients see 20/30 and are happy with their vision). No one has lost their vision having LASIK surgery by Dr. Manger. According to laser industry authorities, there are 64 LASIK surgeons in Orange County, California, and Dr. Manger performs 35% of all LASIK procedures done in Orange County.

  "text" : "Charles Henry Parnther (1 October 1813 – 10 November 1854) was an English civil servant and cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, Marylebone Cricket Club, the Gentlemen and All-England teams between 1832 and 1836. He was born at Westminster, London and died at Walham Green, also in London. Parnther was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was an all-rounder: generally a middle-order batsman and a bowler, though it is not known what his batting or bowling styles were. His best bowling match was for Cambridge University against the Cambridge Town Club in 1834 when he opened the batting and top-scored for the university with 31 in the second innings, and took at least seven of the 10 Town wickets, and caught one of the others: the full figures for the game are not available. His best batting came in another good all-round game for him: playing for MCC against Cambridge University in 1835, he scored 17 and an unbeaten 43, and also took seven university wickets, with five in the second innings. He played in the Gentlemen v Players matches of 1834, 1835 and 1836 without much success, and in three games for the All-England team (which played as \"England\") he made only one run and took no wickets at all. Parnther graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1836; he was later employed at the Foreign Office."

These matches were additional track and field events that allowed lesser athletes the opportunity to compete head-to-head with superior professional Olympic competitors by giving them an advantage that leveled the playing field. In this era, a \"handicap\" winner is somewhat similar to an amateur winner of a professional event. In the 100-yard dash, Hastedt was given a 4-yard handicap, and in the 60-yard dash, he was given a 4-foot handicap. His victory in the 100-yard dash was the first won by a St. Louis, MO athlete. The 1904 Olympics were also significant in that they were the first Olympics to be held in the United States. \"One of the most successful athletes to participate in the Olympic events was St. Louis native Culver Hastedt. The speedy representative of the Missouri Athletic Club won both the 60- and the 100-yard dashes held during the week of the official Olympic games. Hastedt also won the 100-yard dash in the Olympic Open Handicap Meet, running for Christian Brothers College. His versatility showed by taking second in the running broad jump at the same event. At these same Olympic Games during the Western Association AAU handicap Meet, Hastedt won the (Gold Medal for the) running broad jump. For all his efforts, he was dubbed \"King of the Handicaps'.\"— Jim Greensfelder, Jim Lally, Bob Christianson and Max Storm, 1904 Olympic Games Official Medals and Badges"

  "text" : "Charles Richard Payne (20 December 1827 – 31 January 1859) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played in one first-class cricket match for Cambridge University in 1848. He was born at Hepworth, Suffolk and died at Abu Simbel, Egypt. Payne was educated at Winchester College and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He played cricket for the Winchester side as a middle-order batsman, and was picked for the Cambridge non-first-class trial matches in both 1847 and 1848. In the 1848 trial, he top-scored for the \"Cambridge Second XI\" in both innings, and this led to him being picked for a first-team match (the second team beat the first eleven convincingly, but some of this was to do with having John Wisden, not a Cambridge student, in their team, as he took 10 wickets). Payne opened the innings and scored three runs, but this proved to be his only first-class outing as he was not required to bat in the second innings. Payne graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1850. He was ordained as a Church of England priest and was curate of Stanton, Suffolk from 1855 to his death."

The son of John Archibald Sinclair Emerson and Jennie Bayley, he was born in St. John's and was educated at Bishop Feild College. Emerson practised law with his uncle Prescott Emerson. He was called to the Newfoundland bar in 1891. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Newfoundland assembly in an 1894 by-election. He was elected to the assembly in 1900 and then was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1904 by Conservative Robert Moulton. From 1909 to 1917, he served in the dominion cabinet as a minister without portfolio. Emerson resigned his seat in the Newfoundland assembly in November 1919; he was subsequently named registrar for the Newfoundland Supreme Court. In 1913, Emerson married Helen Louise Scott. He died in Boston at the age of 55. His son Frederick Rennie Emerson was a lawyer, musician and composer who played an important role in promoting the awareness of Newfoundland's cultural heritage."

  "text" : "Charles Ernest Peers (1875, Belfast, Northern Ireland – 1944, Higgovale, Cape Town, South Africa) was a South African artist. Peers spent his youth in Liverpool, England, where he recorded the shipping activity on the Mersey. He wished to become a naval architect, but could not afford to study professionally. He spent a brief period at the Liverpool School of Art before settling in South Africa in 1904. Peers was elected a member of the South African Society of Artists in 1905, and became chairman of the South African Fine Arts Association. He won the Cape Times poster competition in 1924, and became a member of the South African Institute of Art in 1926. Peers subsequently was president of the Owl Club in 1934, president of the K Club in 1935, was invited by the New Group to participate in their first exhibition in 1938, and subsequently was elected President of the group, an office he held until his death. Peers made a living as a chromo-lithographer with various printing companies, including Galvin & Sales in Cape Town. He illustrated The Seven Wonders of South Africa by Hedley Chilvers and The Coast of Hermanus by Will Costello. He also produced a series of auto-lithographic cigarette cards for the United Tobacco Company album Our Land / Ons Land (1939), and several illustrated calendars during the 1930s for the Vacuum Oil Company. Peers worked mainly in watercolor, but also produced oils and pastels as well as pencil drawings, etchings, linocuts, and lithographs. He concentrated on landscapes, architecture, and maritime subjects."

  "text" : "Charles Pigg (4 September 1856 – 28 February 1929) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and other amateur sides between 1876 and 1901. He was born at Buntingford, Hertfordshire and died at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. His twin brother, Herbert Pigg, also played first-class cricket. Pigg was educated at Abington House School in Northampton and at Peterhouse, Cambridge. As a cricketer he was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm round-arm slow bowler. He matriculated at Cambridge University in the autumn of 1875, but in the 1876 season his only first-class cricket match was for an England XI against the university side: he scored one run and took one wicket. He played for the university team in a handful of matches in 1877, 1878 and 1879, but at a time when the team could call upon the services of players such as A. G. Steel, A. P. Lucas and Ivo Bligh, plus a smattering of Lytteltons, he did not warrant a regular place and he was not picked for any of the University Matches against Oxford University. Pigg graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1879; this converted to a Master of Arts in 1887. He became a schoolmaster at Blair Lodge School in Scotland for four years before taking up private tutoring, initially in St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex. From 1892 to 1922, he was a private tutor in Cambridge, coaching the duller students through the rigours of Cambridge exams and, according to a reminiscence in The Times at his death, a much-loved and respected character. \"I should doubt whether any coach ever had pupils more numerous, more idle, and, on the whole, more pleasant,\" wrote a correspondent calling himself \"B. D.\". \"They loved him; they confided in him as to their adventures; they called him Charles; and they all felt for him complete respect as well as affection.\" Pigg resumed his intermittent first-class cricket career from 1886 with occasional matches for MCC, many of them against Cambridge University, and for other amateur teams. His highest first-class score came in 1890 when he captained MCC against Cambridge at Fenner's and scored 48; he never took more than one wicket in an innings with his occasional bowling. From the mid 1890s he played regularly for Hertfordshire in the Minor Counties competition and from 1903 to 1911 he likewise appeared in Minor Counties games for Cambridgeshire, often acting as captain and sometimes with his sons, Charles and Bernard, playing alongside him. In addition to his cricket activities, he was also a keen golfer and was instrumental in securing permanent facilities for the Cambridge University Golf Club at a course near Newmarket. He retired to Cheltenham but had been present at the winter meeting of the golf club a month before his death."

Documents prepared by the American OSS, and used in evidence at the Nuremberg Trials, record that the Nazis were cautious with regard to the murder of church leaders, and conscious of not wanting to create martyrs. Nevertheless, Catholic leaders frequently faced violence or the threat of violence, particularly at the hands of the SA, the SS or Hitler Youth. A number of cases were cited by the OSS, including one against Archbishop Klein of Paderborn."

  "text" : "Charles \"Bud\" Dant (born Charles Gustave Dant; June 21, 1907, Washington, Indiana – October 31, 1999, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii) was a musician, arranger and composer. In the 1930s, he attended and graduated Indiana University's School of Music. Jazz composer Hoagy Carmichael had persuaded Dant—who at that time had his own \"Bud Dant Collegians\" danceband—to come to IU to study at their School of Music. At that time, Carmichael did not know how to read or write music. The two friends met one day in 1927 at the school's Book Nook restaurant, where Carmichael played the first several bars of a song he had conceived—a jazz chorus. He asked Dant to write an arrangement right there in the Book Nook restaurant—this was the first time the song Stardust, which at the time was called \"Star Dust,\" had ever been written down. According to Dant, the piece was originally a peppy jazz song and recorded in 1927, but in 1928, a slower version was written out by Dant and Carmichael. The piece was recorded with Carmichael and others at the Gennett Recording Studios in Richmond, Indiana. In 1929, Mitchell Parish wrote lyrics to the song. Stardust, an idiosyncratic melody in medium tempo, became an American standard, and is one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century, with over 1,500 total recordings. Dant graduated Indiana and played with big bands of the 1940s in the East Coast, notably Herby Kaye, who was briefly married to Dorthy Lamour, who provided the vocals. Dant briefly conducted his own group but in 1939, Charles left his life as a bandmember in Chicago and Indiana and came to California. He had been asked by Gordon Jenkins, the head of NBC music, to orchestrate and conduct radio shows for NBC in Hollywood. He and his wife Nell and children Christopher and Susan settled in Beverly Hills in 1938. During this period, Dant became the musical director for NBC. He spent many years composing and conducting the music for radio and TV with such people as Jack Carson, Dennis Day, Jack Benny, Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin, Phil Harris, Bing Crosby, Hoagy Carmichael, and Judy Canova. He also wrote and orchestrated music for movies. He conducted the orchestra for the Colgate Comedy Hour on TV. Later in his career, Dant recorded for Decca Records, which he joined in 1955 as producer. While at Decca, Dant also discovered a talented clarinet player at The Lawrence Welk Show, Pete Fountain, and recorded 42 hit albums with him. He also recorded many albums with Ricky Nelson, Teresa Brewer, Earl Grant, and several others. His albums are still sold today. He wrote and recorded 60 albums, including The Unicorn (single #32254) with The Irish Rovers in 1968. Charles Dant was awarded several gold records for this recording in 1968. He served as executive producer of William Shatner's notorious 1968 album \"The Transformed Man\" (DL 75043). Dant continued with Decca-Coral until the 1970s, when he moved to Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. There, he succeeded Webley Edwards, founder of \"Hawaii Calls\"—the longtime Hawaiian music radio show. He produced albums by Hawaii performers, including music composed by Alex Anderson and songs sung by Alfred Apaka and Melveen Leed. Dant belonged to St. Michael's Catholic Church and was band leader at Hulihee Palace. On October 31, 1999, he died at age 92 of natural causes in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii and was buried at St. Michael’s Church."

  "text" : "Sir Charles Pontifex KCIE (5 June 1831 – 27 July 1912) was an English lawyer and colonial administrator and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and amateur teams in the 1850s. He was born in London and died in South Kensington, also part of London. The son of John Pontifex, a cricket player of the 1820s, Charles Pontifex was educated at King's College School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was often a lower-order batsman and usually a bowler, though he later batted as an opener and it is not always clear, from incomplete records, that he bowled in every game. Equally, it is not known if he hatted right- or left-handed, and nor is his bowling style recorded, though his obituary in The Times states that he bowled left-handed. He made an immediate impact in early matches for the Cambridge side in 1851: in his first game, he took six Cambridge Town Club wickets in the first innings, though the complete record for this game has not survived. He was picked for the University Match against Oxford University and took 10 wickets in the game, which Cambridge won by an innings and four runs. Pontifex was less successful for Cambridge in the 1852 season and was not picked for the University Match, which Oxford won easily. An obituary from 1912 in The Times suggests that he was in poor health that year. After the Cambridge season was over, however, he turned out for amateur teams representing the Gentlemen of the South and the Gentlemen of Kent. He returned to better form in 1853, when he was captain of the university team. In the first first-class game of the season, against the Cambridge Town Club, he opened the batting and scored 32, the highest score of his first-class career; he also took six wickets in the Town Club's first innings. He was not successful as captain in the 1853 University Match, as Oxford again won with an innings to spare. Pontifex graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1854 and was called to the bar in the same year. He played in some amateur cricket games after Cambridge, but only three of them, in successive seasons from 1858 and all for the Gentlemen of Kent side, were rated as first-class. In 1872, he was appointed as a puisne judge on the High Court of Bengal in India \"with every prospect of becoming Chief Justice\", according to his Times obituary; in the event, a change of government in the UK appointed Richard Garth, also a first-class cricketer, and Pontifex remained on the judges' bench for 10 years. In 1882, he was recalled to London to become a special legal adviser to the Marquess of Hartington, Secretary of State for India and he remained in this post until he retired in 1892, at which point he was knighted. Pontifex married in 1881; his wife was Grace, the widow of Thomas Gribble, formerly postmaster of Bengal, and her son from her first marriage was James Byng Gribble, a champion real tennis player who died in 1902. Lady Pontifex donated the James Byng Gribble Cup to the Gold Medal winner at the Lord's real tennis tournament and was therefore mentioned each year in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack's report of Marylebone Cricket Club business until her own death in 1928."

  "text" : "Charles George Pope (21 January 1872 – 31 January 1959) was an English schoolmaster and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and the Marylebone Cricket Club between 1892 and 1895. He was born at Sandy, Bedfordshire and died at New Milton, Hampshire. Pope was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was captain of cricket at Harrow in 1891 and led his side to victory in the annual Eton v Harrow match at Lord's. A right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler, he had limited opportunities at Cambridge and played only once for the first eleven in 1892 and three times in 1893. In one of the 1893 games, against the Marylebone Cricket Club, he took five second innings wickets for 39 runs and eight wickets in the match, by some distance his best first-class bowling performance. He was not, however, chosen for the 1893 University Match against Oxford. He played more regularly in 1894, though without success with either bat or ball, and won his Blue, taking two wickets and scoring 11 and 0 as Cambridge were easily beaten by Oxford. Pope graduated from Cambridge University with a first-class degree in 1894. He returned for a single final first-class cricket match in 1895, and from that season through to 1901 he also played Minor Counties cricket for Bedfordshire. He became a schoolmaster and from 1899 to 1929 he was on the staff at Harrow School, where he had been a pupil too."

She is the founder and chief executive officer of 3EStrategies, a clean economy consulting firm. During her time as First Lady, Hayes helped launch the Prosperity Initiative to reduce poverty in Oregon.She was also an unsuccessful candidate for the Oregon House of Representatives in 2002, running against state representative Ben Westlund. She is a member of the Democratic Party. In 2005, Hayes was honored as a Top 50 Leader in Oregon by Oregon Business Magazine, and in 2006, she was recognized as one of Cascade Business News' \"40 under 40.\" She was also co-chair of the Oregon Renewable Energy Working Group, which developed clean energy standards for the state. In October 2014, Hayes began receiving increased public attention from ongoing media coverage prompted by articles from Willamette Week reporter Nigel Jaquiss and The Oregonian. The Oregonian followed up on those claims in December 2014 when the publication requested emails from Hayes’ personal email accounts relating to state business. On her personal blog in October 2015, Hayes stated she turned over \"every email\" requested by federal investigators and accused The Oregonian of using her emails to make false allegations and print misinformation. Shortly before announcing his resignation in February 2015, Kitzhaber made the announcement that Hayes would no longer be connected to the governorship in any way and would have no political or policy role during his fourth term."

  "text" : "Charles Stuart Pryor (15 February 1815 – 4 April 1897) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for the Cambridge Town Club, Cambridge University and an England XI between 1833 and 1859. He was born at Cambridge and died at Chesterton, Cambridgeshire. Pryor was a right-handed batsman and a bowler, though his bowling style is not known. He played regularly for the Cambridge Town Club for more than a quarter of a century, and also played for the Cambridge Town and County Club and the Cambridge Townsmen teams, which were alternative names for the same side. In 1839, he played a single game for Cambridge University, but there is no record that he was ever a student at the university, and 23 of his first-class matches were against the university side; the same year he also appeared for \"An England XI\" against the Marylebone Cricket Club, but otherwise his first-class matches were all for Cambridge teams. His single game for Cambridge University was one of his more successful with the bat, as he scored 27 in each innings. His highest score – more than three times more than any other innings he played – was an innings of 103 for the Cambridge Town and County Club against Cambridge University in 1844. Pryor's father Stephen and his son Francis both played first-class cricket for the Cambridge Town Club; his son also played for Cambridgeshire in the period when that side's matches were sometimes rated as first-class."

  "text" : "Christine Wiedinmyer is a research scientist in the Atmospheric Chemistry Division of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. She has a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. Wiedinmyer developed the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN), \"a high resolution global fire emissions model now used by local, regional, and global chemical modelers to better quantify the impacts of fire emissions on atmospheric composition, both in hindsight and forecast model applications.\" She used the model to estimate that the 2010 Russian wildfires liberated 22 teragrams of highly toxic carbon monoxide, though this amount was less than the cumulative carbon monoxide emissions of 2012 and 2003. Wiedinmyer discovered that in the long run, controlled burning of forests will produce up to sixty percent less carbon dioxide emissions compared to the full-fledged wildfires they prevented. Undergrowth will be destroyed by the controlled burns while carbon-rich mature trees survive. Without removing the undergrowth, wildfires can quickly escalate out of control using the undergrowth as fuel, and then burn down mature trees as well. Wiedinmyer is also a co-founder of the Earth Science Women's Network."

After the conclusion of his third year of teaching, he returned to his native Taiwan for a vacation. He was instructed not to leave Taiwan on his scheduled departure date. Members of Taiwan's secret police, the Garrison Command, detained and interrogated him for twelve hours on 2 July 1981, and his body was found on the campus of National Taiwan University the next day. The subsequent autopsy reported his death was due to a fall. Chen's death and the earlier massacre of Lin Yi-hsiung's family are cited as late examples of White Terror dissident suppression activities in Taiwan, although the case remains unsolved and the Garrison Command maintains it had nothing to do with his death."

  "text" : "Cyril Thomas \"Tommy\" Wyche (1926 – January 23, 2015) was a lawyer, conservationist, and a leader in the transformation of downtown Greenville, South Carolina. Wyche was born in Greenville, graduated from Yale University in 1946 and received his law degree from the University of Virginia in 1949. In 1973 Wyche founded Naturaland Trust, a vehicle for his successful attempt to protect the South Carolina Blue Ridge Mountains. He was a principal author of the South Carolina Heritage Trust Act, the South Carolina Conservation Easement Act, and the South Carolina Mountain Protection Act. His efforts resulted in the protection of over 100,000 acres, including Jocassee Gorges, the watersheds of Table Rock and Poinsett Reservoir, and the land between them, which Wyche named Mountain Bridge Wilderness Area and which include Jones Gap and Caesar's Head State Parks. An avid outdoor photographer, Wyche published six books that featured his work, including South Carolina's Mountain Wilderness: The Blue Ridge Escarpment (Englewood, CO: Westcliffe, 1994). Wyche also had the foresight to promote the rejuvenation of downtown Greenville, which during his early career was in serious economic decline. Working with Mayor Max Heller and business leader Buck Mickel, Wyche was a prime mover in the development of the Peace Center, Heritage Green, the Bi-Lo Center (now the Bon Secours Wellness Arena), and the Governor's School for the Arts and Humanities. Wyche, a longtime supporter of the Greenville Symphony Orchestra, was also a pianist and occasional composer. After Wyche's death Edvard Tchivzhel, the orchestra's musical director, arranged and premiered for full orchestra a short piano piece Wyche had written. In 1996, Gov. David Beasley presented Wyche with the Order of the Palmetto. In 2012 a carillon created by van Bergen Bells was dedicated to Wyche in honor of his contributions to the city of Greenville. After Wyche's death, his longtime colleague Frank Holleman called him \"the single most important conservationist in the Upstate, one of the most important people in the state in conservation, and one of a handful of people who made the center of Greenville what it is today.\""

  "text" : "Charles Eldridge was an American stage and screen actor of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the film industry he appeared in over 100 films, although the majority of those were film shorts. He began on the stage during the 1870s, and appeared in at least one Broadway play, Charles Frohman's 1899 production of Because She Loved Him So. His first appearance in film was in a 1910 short, The Legacy, in which he starred. His first appearance in a feature film was in The Strange Story of Sylvia Gray. In addition to the over 100 shorts he was in, Eldridge appeared in 27 feature films between 1914 and 1922. In his roles in full-length films, he would usually appear in a supporting role, although occasionally be given a lead, as in 1917's Polly of the Circus, 1920's Broken Hearts, and 1922's Ashamed of Parents. Polly of the Circus was notable for being the first film released by Goldwyn Pictures, which was shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey, mostly at rented space at the studios owned by Universal Studios. His final screen appearance would be in a supporting role in the 1922 film, No Trespassing, which starred Irene Castle of the famous dancing team, Vernon and Irene Castle.  No Trespassing was released on June 11, 1922, and Eldridge would die soon after, on October 29, 1922 in New York City."

  "text" : "Caleb Frank Gates (1903–1955) was an American historian who served as Chancellor of the University of Denver. Gates was born in Constantinople (now Istanbul), and received his early education at Robert College in Istanbul, where his father (Caleb Frank Gates, 1857-1946) served as president. Gates came to the United States in 1919 and attended The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania for three years. In 1926, he graduated with honors from Princeton University and continued his studies under a Rhodes scholarship at Balliol College in Oxford. In 1928, while attending college, Gates married Elizabeth Farnum in England. They raised four children: Caleb Jr., Betsy Ann, Mary Ellen, and Gwynne. The couple returned to Turkey after Gates graduated from Balliol College with both B. A. and M. A. degrees. He taught history and served as headmaster of the preparatory school at Robert College from 1932 to 1933. Gates returned to Princeton for a year of graduate work in history and was eventually appointed history instructor at Princeton. He also served as assistant dean for three years until 1939, when the dean of the college became incapacitated and the full responsibility of the office rested with Gates. In 1941, Gates accepted the position of Chancellor at the University of Denver. At the age of 37, he was the youngest chancellor in the University's history. In 1943, Gates took a leave of absence from the University to join the army during World War II, with the rank of major. He was stationed first in England with the American Military Government and then as an attaché to the American Ambassador in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. His duties included handling prisoners of war and displaced persons. Gates served two terms as Chancellor of the University of Denver, from 1941 to 1943 and 1946 to 1947. Under his leadership, enrollments rose by 57 percent compared to the pre-war enrollments of 1939, and the number of veterans on campus rose to 60 percent. He presided over the creation of the university's School of Hotel and Restaurant Management, School of Architecture and Planning, and School of Aeronautics. Gates resigned as chancellor in 1947, but remained for two years as professor of history. He joined numerous organizations including the University Club of Denver, Denver Press Club, American Alpine Club, Princeton Club, American Historical Society, Colorado Education Society, and the Foreign Policy Association. His papers at the University of Denver cover his years as Chancellor. Gates and his first wife divorced in 1954. In 1955, he married Mable Ridge and relocated to Santa Rosa, California, to operate the Cedar Shake Guest Lodge. There, on the eve of his 52nd birthday, December 21, 1955 Gates died of a heart attack."

  "text" : "Claudius B. Spencer (born 1856 in Michigan, died 14 July 1934) was a pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church and an editor of Christian publications. Spencer attended Northwestern University and Garrett Seminary, and served as a pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the Detroit Conference from 1881 to 1892. He was then transferred to the Colorado Conference, where he was appointed editor of the Rocky Mountain Christian Advocate. When that publication merged with the Central Christian Advocate, Spencer moved to Kansas City, Missouri, to assume the editorship of that publication. He served in that capacity until his death in 1934. Spencer served on many denominational boards and conferences. He received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Lawrence University in 1896. As eulogized by University of Denver Chancellor Frederick M. Hunter, he \"generated a spirit of enthusiasm and optimism because of what he himself was, as well as because of what he did and said.\" After a short illness, Spencer died on July 14, 1934. The Claudius B. Spencer Papers at the University of Denver include articles from newspapers and magazines concerning Mormonism and the Methodist response to the Mormon Church. Also included are letters written to Spencer in his capacity as editor of the Central Christian Advocate. Many of these letters concern Mormonism, but there are also letters regarding controversies within the Methodist church and other church matters. Half of the collection is typescript pages and handwritten notes from a manuscript titled Holiness and Mormonism. The author of the manuscript is unknown. The manuscript describes the origins of Mormonism and, through lengthy discussion, refutes the legitimacy of the Mormon church."

Uhlig produced his first concertina in 1834, being dissatisfied with the early accordion keyboard developed by Cyrill Demian. Uhlig took the right-handed keyboard of Demian, and split it between the two hands, resulting in an instrument which had two separate keyboards producing individual notes. While Uhlig's development of the concertina is very parallel to that of Charles Wheatstone, the founder of the English family of concertinas, there is no definite indication they were aware of each other's work."

  "text" : "Clifton Cappie Towle (1888–1946), founding member of The Anthropological Society of New South Wales in 1928 with William Walford Thorpe. Clifton Towle was born in Penrith, New South Wales, Australia on 15 Mar 1891 to Charles Towle and Laura A Gow. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree at University of Sydney in 1919 but spent muck of his working life with the New South Wales Railways and followed his interest in anthropology as a very active amateur, gaining knowledge from his own private reading and field observations, and donated many wood and stone Aboriginal artefacts and photographs to Hornshaw’s collection. He travelled to south western Queensland and western New South Wales on these field trips. His personal collection of Aboriginal artefacts was donated to the Australian Museum on his death in 1946. Towle published widely, in Oceania, The Victorian Naturalist, the Australian Anthropological Society Journal, Mankind and the Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. Perhaps his greatest body of work involved hundreds of photographs of carved trees or 'dendroglyphs' which he collected around New South Wales and Queensland. These were subsequently donated to the Australian Museum. Towle died on 22 March 1946 at Eastwood, New South Wales, Australia."

His service corresponded with the administration of Governor Jimmie Davis, a native of nearby Jackson Parish in North Louisiana. In 1956, McCrary ran in a special election to fill the seat vacated by Lorris M. Wimberly of Arcadia, the Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, who left the legislature after lengthy service to join the administration of Governor Earl Kemp Long as the director of the Louisiana Department of Public Works. McCrary lost to Fletcher Sutton, the mayor of Gibsland, 2,030 to 1,784, in a runoff contest but rebounded to claim the seat for a full term in 1960. In 1964, McCrary was succeeded by another Democrat, businessman Len Lacy of Castor, a member of the Bienville Parish School Board, who also held the seat for one term. Lacy was the last person to have represented only Bienville Parish in the legislature. Until 1968, each parish regardless of its population had been guaranteed a seat in the 105-member Louisiana House. Bienville was thereafter combined with Jackson Parish. E. L. Henry, a Democrat from Jonesboro in Jackson Parish, defeated Lacy in the 1967 primary, and in 1972, Henry began an eight-year stint as the Louisiana House Speaker. McCrary and his wife, Ida May McCrary (1908-1997), a native of Eros in Jackson Parish, had three sons, Curtis, Jr., and wife Jackie of Arcadia, Phillip R. McCrary and wife Sue of Monroe, Louisiana, and Dr. Robert McCrary and wife Donna of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The McCrarys are interred at Arcadia Cemetery."

In 1828, he travelled to Florence to visit his ill mother. After her death, he stayed to study at the Accademia di Belle Arti of Florence, where he frequently exhibited. During the 1830s he mainly worked copying works from the Florentine collections for foreign families visiting or residing in Florence. He did paint a Christ points out his Mother to St John the Baptist commissioned by Prince Poniatowski for a church of Kiev. His genre scenes were influenced by the works of David Wilkie. He died of tuberculosis in 1844."

His father, Will, was a shape note teacher in Georgia in the 1920s and 1930s. He first acted as pastor at the age of 12 at the Antioch Baptist Church in Barnesville, Georgia. He was pastor in 14 churches, including his own foundation of the St Joseph's Missionary Baptist Church. In his early twenties, he married Elizabeth Daniels; that union yielded four children: two boys and two girls. Although he had been active in Georgia since his early years, he only gained wider prominence from 1964, when he came to the attention of Fred Mendelsohn, then executive producer at Savoy Records. He recorded at least 19 albums. Although most of his recorded songs are traditional, 26 are listed as his own compositions."

  "text" : "Chamu Krishna Shastry (Devanagari: चमू कृष्ण शास्त्री) is co-founder, All India Prashikshana Pramukh of the Samskrita Bharati movement, which is aiming to make Sanskrit popular across the world. Shastry was born in Kedila village near Mangalore. As a teenager RSS worker he was underground during Emergency. It was in this period that he first read V.D. Savarkar and Swami Vivekananda's writings on Sanskrit. He learnt Samskrit from Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati and, along with some of his friends, went on to start the ‘Speak Sanskrit’ Movement in 1981. The movement has evolved into the not-for-profit organisation Samskrita Bharati, which is active all over India and in 13 countries including USA, Canada and UAE. His method of teaching Sanskrit is to learn it in the same language rather than through other language by translation. The \"Ten-day Sanskrit Speaking Course\", which Shastry has been implementing through a network of 130 full-time workers and 3,000 Sanskrit Bharati volunteers, has a conversation-based syllabus. Learning Sanskrit can be a forbidding exercise because it is being taught through translation. To make it easier for the students Shastry's method is not to learn the language through grammar and teach Sanskrit as it is spoken. The students thus do not have to wrestle with the nuances of an arcane syntactics. It's then easier to master the language, so much so that even semi-literate people can opt for the course. It also helps that the course is for free. His organization which is a voluntary body committed to the cause of Sanskrit, has evolved a simple method that Samskrita Bharati has enabled nearly 1 crore people to learn the language, one lakh of whom have decided to use Sanskrit at home in true ancient style. Sastry spends most of his time on teacher training, workshops, making of learning material and discussing Samskrit education with policy makers. He believes that not just Samskrit as language, but modern subjects like chemistry, maths, history etc should also be taught through Samskrit. “Till now Samskrit has only been seen from a spiritual or religious perspective; it is high time Samskrit is approached from a scientific point of view as well.”"

He was the city's first college-trained architect. In 1874 or 75 he took his brother, Charles P. Damon (d.1919), as a partner. The firm, Damon Brothers, lasted until 1915, at which point Damon appears to have retired. His brother continued the practice for a few more years, doing only minor work."

  "text" : "Catherine H. Graham is an Associate Professor of Ecology and Evolution at the Stony Brook University. She graduated from the University of Missouri at St. Louis in 2000. She studies biogeography, conservation biology, and ecology. Catherine H. Graham is most noted for her analysis of statistical models to describe species' distributions. This work with Jane Elith is useful in determining changes in biodiversity resulting from human activities. Her paper on niche conservatism with John Wiens is also highly cited. They focused on how species' retention of ancestral traits may limit geographic range expansion."
