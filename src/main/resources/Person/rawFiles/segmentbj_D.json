In the 1979 primary election, Ginn upset Edwards Barham, a one-term Republican and the first member of his party since Reconstruction elected to the Louisiana Senate. Ginn won reelection in 1983, when he defeated fellow Democrat Willie E. Crain, 23,062 (52.5 percent) to 20,865 (47.5 percent). This time, the district included Madison Parish, five precincts from Ouachita Parish, as well as Morehouse, Richland, and East and West Carroll. Ginn did not seek a third term in the 1987 primary, as voters elected Willie Crain to the seat by a large margin."

In 2011, Park was arrested for a collage poster depicting an Afro-Swede  student activist naked and in chains along with text saying \"Our negro slave has run away\", and the activist's personal contact information. Park singled out the student activist for reporting a student party with people in blackface. Park was convicted of defamation and racial agitation, and given a suspended sentence, fined, and ordered to pay damages. In 2014, Park was arrested at the opening of an exhibition of his collage posters, and was sentenced to 6 months in jail for incitement to racial agitation and defamation, and ordered to pay a total of 60,000 kronor ($8,700) in damages to four people depicted in his pictures. Additionally, the court ordered 9 of his works destroyed. Park himself insists that his works are not racist, but a satiric commentary on current events and against political correctness in Sweden. Park is mainly notable for the intense public debate about freedom of speech that his case and works have generated, especially in Denmark, where his works have been exhibited in the Parliament building."

  "text" : "Francesco Di Domenico (1880–1966) and Vincenzo Di Domenico (1882–1955), known together as the Di Domenico brothers, were Italian film directors who played an important role in Colombian cinema. Francesco was born on 1 August 1880 in Castelnuovo di Conza and died on 26 December 1966 in Villeta, Cundinamarca Department. Vincenzo was born on 3 October 1882 in Castelnuovo di Conza and died on 12 July 1955 in Barcelona. In the early 1900s, economic growth in Colombia led to the rise of the film industry, including the construction of movie theatres. The Di Domenico brothers moved to Bogotá in 1909, where they founded the Latin American film industry company (Spanish: sociedad industrial cinematográfica latinoamericana) in 1913, with their brothers Giuseppe and Erminio Di Ruggiero and cousins Donato and Giovanni Di Domenico Mazzoli. Colombian film historian Luis Alfredo Álvarez regards their initiative as the first organised attempt of a Colombian national cinema. The Di Domenico brothers created a documentary after the assassination of General Rafael Uribe Uribe, known as El drama del 15 de octubre which was first screened to the public on 21 November 1915. Regarded as the first feature documentary film of Colombia, the reconstruction of the murder, the usage of the assassins in the film, and the images of General Uribe's body caused controversy, which led to riots in some movie theatres. The usage of the assassins of General Uribe in the reconstruction of the murder was described by many newspapers as \"disgusting\" and that it was \"criminal glorification\". The controversy that this film caused led the brothers to cut the most controversial scenes of the film, before it was banned in Colombia and subsequently destroyed. El drama del 15 de octubre was considered a resounding failure of the Di Domenico brothers, but was later described by newspaper Mundo al día as a blockbuster despite the poor image quality."

  "text" : "Richard Anthony Cerri, known as Dick Cerri (June 1, 1936 – October 3, 2013) was a well known Folk Music, American disc jockey in Washington, D.C. between 1960 and 1995. Cerri was born in Utica, New York on June 1, 1936, the younger of two children of Dominick J. Cerri and his wife Mildred May Isaac. Cerri started out in high school as an announcer in Utica on WIBX-AM and moved to ABC affiliate WRUN-AM (see WUTI) where he remained through college. He graduated in 1959 from Utica College. He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1960 and soon after was employed at WAVA-FM, where he created the show \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America.\" Cerri hosted and produced at several area radio stations, including WHFS-FM and WJMD-FM which changed call sign to WLTT-FM (see WIAD where the name of his show was shortened to \"Music Americana.\" He was at WETA-FM from 1970 to 1973 where his brother Bill was also a disc jockey, well known for his classical music show. Cerri had a very humble view of his reputation as an expert instead typifying his role as a spectator, albeit a professional one. Mr. Cerri started the World Folk Music Association with singer-songwriter Tom Paxton in 1982 and Cerri served as its president for much of its existence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Cerri also sponsored monthly musical concerts using the name of his radio show \"Musica Americana.\" Cerri retired in the mid-1990s and continued working with the World Folk Music Association (WFMA). He was most recently working on digitizing his \"Music Americana\" radio shows, a project announced at the \"Remembering Dick Cerri: A Celebration in Song\", will be completed by the WFMA Foundation. The extent of his influence can be gauged by the musicians at the September 27, 2014 concert: Noel Paul Stookey, Peter Yarrow (from Peter, Paul and Mary), Chad Mitchell, Christine Lavin, Schooner Fare, Squid Jiggers (Dave Rowe (musician) & Troy R. Bennett), Donal Leace, Modern Man (Rob Carlson, George Wurzbach and David Buskin), Tom Paxton, Steve Gillette and Cindy Mangsen, Bill Danoff, Mack Bailey, Anne Hills, Carolyn Hester and daughters Amy Blume and Karla Blume, Jonathan Edwards and Side By Side (Doris Justis and Sean McGhee)."

This dissertation under Bernard Balin dealt with \"Gentleman of letters: a study of George Ticknor.\" He taught at Reed College 1959-66, the University of Illinois 1967-69, and since 1969 at Stanford University. He received awards from the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. He served as president of the History of Education Society, 1970-71.Tyack is best known for his wide-ranging studies and interpretations of the history of American education. After examining late 19th century reform movements in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, San Francisco and Chicago, Tyack concludes that, \"What the structural reformers wanted to do, then, was to replace a rather mechanical form of public bureaucracy, which was permeated with 'illegitimate' lay influence, with a streamlined 'professional' bureaucracy in which lay control was carefully filtered through a corporate school board."

  "text" : "Daniele Piomelli is an Italian-born American scientist. He studied neuroscience in New York City, with James H. Schwartz and Eric R. Kandel at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (PhD, 1983-1988) and later with Paul Greengard at the Rockefeller University (Post-doc, 1988-1990). Two of his mentors (ERK and PG) received in 2000 the Nobel Prize for their contributions to medicine. After working at the INSERM in Paris (1990-1995) and at the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla (1995-1998) with Nobel Prize winner Gerald Edelman, he joined the University of California Irvine School of Medicine, where he is now Louise Turner Arnold Chair in Neurosciences and Professor of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Pharmacology and Biological Chemistry. He is also founding director of the department of Drug Discovery and Development (D3) at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Genova, Italy. Daniele Piomelli has made important contributions to the understanding of lipid mediator function in the brain and nervous system. He elucidated the biochemical pathways involved in the formation and deactivation of the lipid-derived endocannabinoids – anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol  – and uncovered various physiological roles played by these compounds. Additionally, he described the functions of two lipid amides –palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide – in the control of pain  and feeding, and identified the cellular receptors involved in such functions. Collaborating with Italian chemists, Giorgio Tarzia (University of Urbino ‘Carlo Bo’) and Marco Mor (University of Parma), he developed the first systemically active inhibitors of the degradation of anandamide (Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase inhibitors), PEA (N-Acylethanolamide Acid Amidase inhibitors), and ceramide (Acid Ceramidase inhibitors). Daniele Piomelli is scientific cofounder of Kadmus Pharmaceuticals and Thesan Pharmaceuticals."

Shugar received her bachelor's degree in biology and English in 1983 from Augustana College (Illinois) and then her master's degree in 1988 and her Ph.D. in English in 1991 from the University of Iowa. At the University of Rhode Island Shugar became the first department-head of the Women's Studies major. Besides being a professor, Dana Shugar was an author and advocate for feminism. As a writer she contributed to numerous feminist and lesbian journals. She released her first book Separatism and Women's Community in May 1995 that focused on feminist and lesbian separatism, which were changes that were happening to women's lives across the nation. The book was nominated that year for the American Library Association's Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Book Award. According to WorldCat, the book is held in 334 libraries. She was working on a second book involving her experience with breast cancer, but never finished it. In honor of her accomplishments and contributions, the University of Rhode Island has a scholarship in her name. The University also holds an annual colloquium on women's studies in her name that brings up seminars on numerous feminism issues and topics."

Ranson was born in Sheffield, England, subsequently migrating to Australia and completing his PhD in 1978 on the excavation of one hut depression in a cluster of three at Sundown Point, Tasmania. Ranson was one of the people credited with the discovery of Fraser Cave (later renamed Kutikina Cave), with Rhys Jones in Tasmania's West Coast, which established the Pleistocene occupation of the Tasmanian highlands. In the 1990s he was senior archaeologist with the Department of Parks, Wildlife and Heritage Tasmania. He has most recently been with the Aboriginal Heritage Office, in the Cultural Heritage Branch, DPIWE, Tasmania. Ranson was also a pioneer of the application of remote sensing techniques for the discvery of archaeological sites in Australia, one example being applied to the Aboriginal burials at Wybellina."

This was printed in Sydney in 1866, making it the first book printed in any dialect of Efate. In 1869, Morrison left the New Hebrides due to ill health, and died in Auckland. J.

  "text" : "Donna McFarlane (born 1958 in Rosemont, Quebec) is a Canadian writer, who was a shortlisted nominee for the Governor General's Award for English-language fiction at the 1994 Governor General's Awards for her novel Division of Surgery. Published by Women's Press, Division of Surgery was an autobiographical novel about McFarlane's own experience in the medical system after being diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Born in Rosemont, Quebec and raised in Ottawa, McFarlane graduated from York University in 1982 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and was working as a librarian at the time of her Crohn's diagnosis. The novel began life as a journal that she kept during her hospital stays, and later submitted to CKLN-FM after Arnie Achtman's documentary series Life Rattle broadcast a story about another woman battling chronic illness. Achtman helped McFarlane organize her notes into a novel, and later became McFarlane's partner. The doctor in the novel, known only by the name \"The Prophet\", was based on Mount Sinai Hospital surgeon Zane Cohen. At the time of her award nomination, she was working as a program coordinator for Windfall, a charity organization that distributed clothing to needy women. She subsequently published a number of short stories in literary magazines, but has not published any further books."

Hilferty was named CEO of Independence Blue Cross in 2010, which serves 9 million customers in 24 states. Prior to 2010, he had been President and Chief Executive Officer of the AmeriHealth Mercy Family of Companies. Hilferty grew up in Ocean City, New Jersey and graduated in 1974 from St. Augustine Preparatory School, which recognized him in 2014 with its Gregor Mendel medal in recognition of his career accomplishments and philanthropy. Hilferty earned a Bachelor of Science degree at Saint Joseph's University in Accounting in 1978 and was awarded a Master of Public Administration degree from American University. Hilferty had received an offer of a $22,000-a-year position at Electronic Data Systems after completing his graduate degree in 1981, but turned it down in favor of a spot at Misericordia Hospital. Hilferty worked with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in a volunteer program improving city playgrounds in Portland, Oregon and came to the realization that he \"was a pretty good leader\" based on his ability to accomplish his goals by managing his resources and connecting with government officials. From 1987 to 1990, Hilferty was the assistant vice president overseeing community and media relations for Saint Joseph's University. From 1990 to 1992, Hilferty was the Executive Director of PennPorts in the administration of Governor of Pennsylvania Robert P. Casey, where he oversaw development aspects of the commonwealth's ports in Erie, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In 1994, Hilferty ran unsuccessfully as one of 8 candidates seeking the Democratic Party nomination as Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania. In a 2013 interview, Hilferty said that he would have delayed implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by a year to allow better coordination between stakeholders that would allow for a better result. He also advocated for broader expansion of Medicaid in all states and suggested that appropriate penalties were needed to ensure that all individuals had health insurance that would be available to them at a wide range of price points and coverage."

  "text" : "David Newell was primarily known as an American character actor, whose acting career spanned from the very beginning of the sound film era through the middle of the 1950s. He made his film debut in a featured role in The Hole in the Wall, a 1929 film starring Edward G. Robinson and Claudette Colbert. Early in his career he had many featured roles, in such films as: RKO's The Runaway Bride in 1929, starring Mary Astor; 1931's Ten Cents a Dance, starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Lionel Barrymore; and White Heat in 1934. He would occasionally receive a starring role, as in 1930's Just Like Heaven, which co-starred Anita Louise. However, by the mid-1930s he was being relegated to mostly smaller supporting roles. Some of the more notable films he appeared in include: A Star is Born (1937), which stars Janet Gaynor and Fredric March; Blondie (1938); the Bette Davis vehicle, Dark Victory (1939); Day-Time Wife (1939), starring Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell; It's a Wonderful World (1939), with James Stewart and Claudette Colbert; Rings on Her Fingers (1942), starring Henry Fonda and Gene Tierney; the Danny Kaye and Dinah Shore film, Up in Arms (1944), which also stars Dana Andrews; 1947's Killer McCoy with Mickey Rooney, Brian Donlevy, and Ann Blyth; Homecoming (1948), starring Clark Gable, Lana Turner, and Anne Baxter; That Wonderful Urge (1949), starring Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney; David and Bathsheba (1951), starring Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward; and Cecil B. DeMille's 1952 blockbuster, The Greatest Show on Earth. During his 25-year acting career, he appeared in over 110 films. His final appearance in film was in 1954's The Eddie Cantor Story, in which he had a small supporting role. In the late 1940s he also began working as a make-up artist, which he transitioned full-time to in 1955; this was due to injuries sustained during a car accident, which left him physically disfigured. He retired from the film industry in 1961, although he continued to work in television through the beginning of the 1970s, his last position being the make-up artist on the television show, Lassie. Newell died two days past his 75th birthday, on January 25, 1980."

At the time he undertook military expeditions across the Syr Darya to explore the lands of the Scythians, during which he furthered farther to the north than any Greeks before him, with the possible exception of Alexander the Great. During the expedition he repopulated Alexandria Eschate, which had been destroyed by a previous barbarian attack. He also constructed several altars in honour of Apollo along the river. Demodamas later wrote an autobiographical account of his expeditions in Central Asia, which served as an important source for the Roman geographers Strabo and Pliny the Elder."

  "text" : "Daniel Agnew was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania from 1873 to 1879. Agnew was born at Trenton, NJ on January 5, 1809, and was of Irish/Welsh heritage. His father was a Princeton-educated doctor; his mother was part of the Howell family that was prominent in New Jersey affairs of that era. The family moved to Pittsburg(h), PA when Agnew was about four years old. Agnew grew up there, attended the Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh), and then studied law with two experienced attorneys. He was admitted to the bar in 1829, at age 20 and began practicing law. He soon relocated his legal practice about 35 miles north, to the town of Beaver, Pennsylvania, the county seat of Beaver County. He became an expert on land titles, an important topic in western Pennsylvania at that time. In his retirement he used this expertise to write a book on the subject, published in 1887 and entitled: A History of the Region of Pennsylvania North of the Ohio and West of the Allegheny River, of the Indian Purchases, and the Running of the Southern, Northern and Western Boundaries. In 1831, he married Elizabeth Moore, daughter of Robert Moore, a prominent citizen and politician in Beaver. In 1836, he was chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of Pennsylvania. In 1851, he was appointed to fill a vacancy as President Judge of a four-county district. Within a few months, he was elected to a full ten-year term for that position; in 1861, he was elected to a second ten-year term. In 1863, he attracted statewide attention for a speech that he gave with the title Our National Constitution: Its Adaptation to a State of War or Insurrection. Subsequently, he was nominated in 1864 to run for a seat as Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Running on a Republican ticket that also included the popular Republican governor Andrew Curtin, Agnew defeated the incumbent, then-Chief Justice Walter H. Lowrie. In 1873, he became the Chief Justice. His service on the Court included writing the opinion in the case of Commonwealth v. Drum, which is often cited as the foundation authority on the legal definition of murder in Pennsylvania. At the conclusion of his term in 1879, Agnew retired to his home in Beaver and from that point handled only a very few select legal matters. He occupied his time by writing a number of pamphlets devoted to the history of the Beaver area. His health began to decline around 1899 and he died on March 9, 1902. He was survived by two sons and two daughters. He was predeceased by his wife and possibly a daughter. Agnew was in the Whig Party until the Republican Party was being organized in the late 1850s. He assisted in that party's organization and was thereafter known as a Republican. He attended the Methodist Episcopal church. He received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Washington College (1864) and Dickinson College (1880), both in Pennsylvania."

  "text" : "Leelah Alcorn (November 15, 1997 – December 28, 2014) was an American transgender girl whose suicide attracted international attention. Alcorn had posted a suicide note to her Tumblr blog, writing about societal standards affecting transgender people and expressing the hope that her death would create a dialogue about discrimination, abuse and lack of support for transgender people. Assigned male at birth and given the name Joshua Ryan Alcorn, she was raised in a conservative Christian household in Ohio. At age 14, she came out as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy with the intention of convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She committed suicide by walking out in front of oncoming traffic on the Interstate 71 highway. Alcorn arranged for her suicide note to be posted online several hours after her death, and it soon attracted international attention across mainstream and social media. LGBT rights activists called attention to the incident as evidence of the problems faced by transgender youth, while vigils were held in her memory in the United States and United Kingdom. Petitions were formed calling for the establishment of \"Leelah's Law\", a ban on conversion therapy in the U.S., which received a supportive response from U.S. President Barack Obama. Within a year, the city of Cincinnati had criminalised conversion therapy. Alcorn's parents were criticized for misgendering Leelah in comments that they made to the media, while LGBT rights activist Dan Savage blamed them for their child's death and social media users subjected them to online harassment. They defended their refusal to accept their child's identity and their use of conversion therapy by reference to their Christian beliefs."

  "text" : "Degii (Delgerjargal) Sodbaatar graduated from Ulaanbaatar University, Mongolia in 2000 with a degree in Korean language and culture. Later she did a one year course on Korean poetics at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang, North Korea. She then entered Donguk University of South Korea as a graduate student, to pursue an MA in Buddhist studies. In addition to the above academic endeavors, in 2009 Degii spent three months in residence at Smith College, Mass., USA, as part of a Mongolian art and culture exchange, and a one month residence at the University of Indiana in Bloomington. Then in 2010-11 she did a six month internship at the Olcott Institute of the Theosophical Society of America, Wheaton, Ill., to upgrade her English translation skills. In Mongolia she worked as publications manager at Maitri Books, and also ran a small travel company for people wishing to visit the Buddhist power places in the country. She is a permanent member of the Board of Directors of the Kim Ill Jung Flower Growers Association of Mongolia, as well as a member of the Board of Advisors of the America Mongolia Friendship Society. Her first book was her translation and publication of a bilingual edition of the Blavatsky classic, The Voice of the Silence, for the Nicholas Roerich Society of Mongolia. She also oversaw the editing work and publication of Michael Kohn's Lama of the Gobi, a study of the life, legends and works of the great 19th century Mongolian mystic Danzan Rabjaa, the fifth incarnation of the great Gelukpa lama known as the Noyon Hutuktu. Her most recent book is entitled Reflections of a Mongolian Shaman, a translation of the writings from the famous Mongolian shaman Byampadorj Dondog. He was born in 1947 in Darvi Sum of Hovd Amaig, southwest Mongolia, in a maternal lineage descended from the tribe of the wife of Chinggis Haan (Genghis Khan). This was the harsh era of the Stalinist purges, when Mongolia was a satellite of the Soviets, and thus he grew up during a period when both Buddhism and Shamanism were oppressed to the point of near extinction. In his youth he secretly trained in the ancient shamanic arts under several underground masters, and when Communism fell in 1990 he emerged as a principal force in the efforts of cultural and spiritual restoration. Degii is presently working on her third book, Lojong: A Modern Perspective from a Mongolian Woman,"

  "text" : "Domenico Cavalca (Vicopisano, c. 1270 – Pisa, October 1342) was an Italian writer. He was a friar of the Dominican order and lived a life, mostly spent in the monastery of Santa Caterina, of irreproachable morals, characterized by attention to poors and sicks. Cavalca dedicated much time and care to nunneries in the province of Pisa and his activity led to the foundation in 1342, just before his death, of the Dominican nunnery of Santa Marta (today no longer existing) in Pisa. The works of Cavalca, of religious or ascetic subject, are in part original, in part derived from Latin texts. His treatises are strongly influenced by Summae virtutum ac vitiorum, a treatise written in the thirteenth century by the French Dominican William Perault. Cavalca became a very famous writer and in the following centuries many works were attributed to him, but in many cases these were erroneous attributions."

  "text" : "Desmond Ryan was an author, historian, and in his earlier life a revolutionary in Sinn Féin. Ryan was born in London, on 27 August 1893, son of the Templemore, Tipperary-born London journalist William Patrick Ryan, editor of the Peasant and Irish Nation and assistant editor of the London Daily Herald, and his wife, Elizabeth.He came to Ireland in 1906, aged 13, with his mother and sister, and studied at St Enda's School, Rathfarnham, under Padraig Pearse; later he taught in the school and was briefly Pearse's secretary. Ryan attributed to Pearse the saying \"[G]ive me a hundred men and I will free Ireland!\" Ryan became part of a group of former students lodging in St Enda's while they went to university who joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood. They used to meet in a safe house at Rathfarnham in 1911. The men took the tram from Rathfarnham to Nelson's Pillar in Central Dublin. Pearse once told his friend, \"Let them talk! I am the most dangerous revolutionary of the whole lot of them!\" In 1911, the Dungannon Clubs would revive the Volunteers Militia movement. These clubs were not initially successful in Dublin, but more so in Belfast amongst Catholic nationalists. One of the northern members the Dubliner Oscar Traynor, in his youth a professional footballer with Belfast Celtic F.C., later a war hero and later again a politician and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. At this stage, according to Ryan, Pearse was a constitutional nationalist and spoke for Home Rule from a platform shared with Tom Kettle and John Redmond, and refused to hear any criticism of the Irish Parliamentary Party. But on the foundation of the Ulster Volunteer Force by Edward Carson and the approach of World War I, Pearse became increasingly sure that Ireland could not achieve independence except by force, and began with Thomas MacDonagh, Eamonn Ceannt, Joseph Plunkett, Thomas Clarke, Bulmer Hobson and others to plan the Rising. Eoin MacNeill was appointed leader of the Irish Volunteers; Ryan wrote that Pearse told him MacNeill was \"too tactful\" — Pearse was a risk-taker and idealist; MacNeill was prepared to entertain the Irish Parliamentary Party with negotiations. Ryan quotes Pearse as saying: [MacNeill] has the reputation of being tactful, but his tact consists in bowing to the will of the Redmondites every time. He never makes a fight except when they assail his personal honour, when he bridles up at once... very delicate position... he is weak, hopelessly weak. He told Ryan that MacNeill was \"a Grattan come to life again\". Henry Grattan was a constitutional orator and MP in the Protestant-only 18th-century Irish House of Commons, one of those who signed the notorious 1801 Act of Union, secured by massive bribery (which was then repaid out of Irish taxes), making Ireland part of the United Kingdom. Moreover, MacNeill was an \"inconclusive ditherer\"; he wanted Volunteers to be apolitical. The Easter Rising was preceded by the revelation of the \"Castle Document\", a plan by the British government to arrest the leaders of the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army and other radicals. Ryan claimed that this document, presented to MacNeill on the Wednesday before the Rising and said to have been stolen from high-ranking British staff in Dublin Castle, was a forgery. It has been claimed that it was concocted by Joseph Plunkett with the implicit approval of Catholic Archbishop Cullen of Dublin, a sympathiser with Dublin Castle and Redmond's war stratagem. \"Forgery is a strong word,\" Ryan said, \"but that in its final form the document was a forgery no doubt can exist whatever\". Modern interpretation from Charles Townshend has judged the document to be genuine, and the opinion attributed to the Archbishop's Palace as circumstantial. Grace Gifford, Plunkett's widow, said that she was with Plunkett when he deciphered it at Larkfield House. Prior to his execution, Sean Mac Dermott was met by a priest, and so made the assumptive response that it was a fraudulent document. Ryan fought through the Easter Rising from 24 March 1916 in the GPO under murderous artillery fire, and describes the battle vividly in his witness statement to the Bureau of Military History; he describes the garrison retreating to Moore Street and quotes Pearse's sculptor brother Willie Pearse, who would be executed a few days later, as saying \"Connolly has been asked out to negotiate. They have decided to go to save the men from slaughter, for slaughter it is.\" Ryan fought in the War of Independence, and afterwards wrote about his experiences; however, the Civil War which followed from June 1922 to April 1923 repelled him; he could not accept that Irishmen would fight Irishmen. He returned to his studies in University College Dublin, and after taking his BA followed his father into journalism, working for the Freeman's Journal. In 1922, he moved to London to work on the Daily Herald. He wrote books on Pearse, James Connolly, Éamon de Valera, Seán Treacy and John Devoy, and on Fenianism as well as writing on the Rising and the War of Independence. He married Sarah Hartley in 1933. In 1939 they returned to Ireland, where he edited the Torch, a Labour paper. Finding his views at odds with the Labour Party's official line, publication ceased in 1944. Husband and wife then moved to Swords in north County Dublin, where they ran a poultry farm. Desmond Ryan died on 23 December 1964."

He was a member of the princely Mukhrani branch of the Bagrationi dynasty, born as a younger son of Kaikhosro, Prince of Mukhrani. His regnal name is sometimes given as Domentius II. Domentius was a son of Kaikhosro, Prince of Mukhrani, born sometime before 1629. In 1649, he was ordained as an archbishop of Samtavro. In 1660, he succeeded to the patriarchal throne on the death of Christophorus II with the approval of his reigning Muslim cousin, Vakhtang V (Shah Nawaz Khan). Domentius was a supporter of Vakhtang's policy aimed at enhancing central authority at the expense of self-minded nobility, but he energetically opposed the Iranian customs prevailing at the royal court of that time. Domentius' authority extended only to eastern Georgia, with the western Georgian church running its own affairs as a result of the past political and ecclesiastic fragmentation. Immediately following his accession, Domentius embarked on a program of reorganizing perishes, building new churches, such as in Mchadijvari, and restoring older ones, such as Anchiskhati in Tbilisi, to which he attached a bell tower. He was also responsible for acquiring the venerated icon of the Savior brought from the defunct Ancha monastery to Tbilisi and earning new land estates for the Patriarchal Cathedral of Mtskheta. Domentius' reforms were supported by Vakhtang's wife Queen Mariam, a devout Christian."

  "text" : "Domentius I (Georgian: დომენტი I, Domenti I) was a Georgian churchman and the Catholicos Patriarch of Georgia who presided over the Georgian Orthodox Church in the latter half of the 16th century. Surviving documents testify to Domentius' efforts to aggrandize the church's land properties and restore those holdings that had earlier been lost to secular noble landlords. According to the early-18th-century royal historian Prince Vakhushti, Domentius \"was installed\" as catholicos by King Simon I immediately after his accession to the throne of Kartli in eastern Georgia in 1556. Domentius' rule was limited to the eastern Georgian territories, with his see at Mtskheta; the west was under the jurisdiction of the breakaway Catholicate of Abkhazia. Even in the east, the Kingdom of Kakheti, run by a dynasty vying with their royal cousins in Kartli, tried to establish its own church. This attempt failed and Domentius was able to obtain pledges of loyalty from the Kakhetian bishops between 1556 to 1560. Further, in 1560, George, Crown Prince of Kakheti, restored to the see of Mtskheta a number of estates earlier lost by the church to that kingdom. There is no consensus as to the duration of Domentius' tenure. The catholicos named Domentius is known from two chronological groups of documents from the late 16th century. The church historian Michel Tamarati identifies two catholicoi with this name from that period, Domentius I (1557–1560) and Domentius II (1595–1602). The Georgian Orthodox Church also follows this numbering, assigning the years 1556–1560 to Domentius I and c. 1595–1610 to Domentius II. In contrast, some historians, such as Kalistrate Salia, consider these two Domentius to have been one person, with two tenures (1557–1562, 1599–1603) with a gap of nearly four decades."

  "text" : "Dai Chunning (simplified Chinese: 戴春宁; traditional Chinese: 戴春寧; pinyin: Daì Chūnníng; born February 1962) is a former Chinese business executive. He served as the deputy general manager of the China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (also known as Sinosure) from 2012 to 2013. Dai began his career as a bank loans administrator in Wuzhong, Ningxia. He then made his way up the ranks of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Ningxia, then was transferred to work in Beijing under the national risk management division. He then worked in the loans administration and general operations departments of the Exim Bank of China. In March 2010 he was promoted to lead the general services division of the bank. Beginning in August 2011 he served as the chief assistant to the bank's president. In April 2012 he began working for Sinosure as a vice-president. As he was a senior executive at a state-owned corporation, he also held the rank of a department-prefecture level official on China's civil service hierarchy. On December 1, 2013, Dai was detained for investigation for \"severe violations of discipline and law\" by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Communist Party's anti-graft agency. The investigation concluded in June 2014 that Dai \"embezzled massive amounts of public funds with his associates, took massive bribes personally or in association with others, abused his position of power for his personal interests and those of related companies\" and that he \"committed adultery.\" He was then expelled from the Communist Party of China. On October 21, 2014, Dai was indicted by prosecution organs in Hebei province and arrested to face charges of bribery and embezzlement."

  "text" : "The body of Elisa Lam, also known by her Cantonese name, Lam Ho Yi (simplified Chinese: 蓝可儿; traditional Chinese: 藍可兒; April 30, 1991 – 2013), a 21-year-old Canadian student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, was recovered from a water tank atop the Cecil Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles on February 19, 2013. She had been reported missing at the beginning of the month. Maintenance workers at the hotel discovered the body when investigating guest complaints of problems with the water supply. Her disappearance had been widely reported; interest had increased five days prior to her body's discovery when the Los Angeles Police Department released video of the last time she was known to have been seen, on the day of her disappearance, by an elevator security camera. In the footage, Lam is seen exiting and re-entering the elevator, talking and gesturing in the hallway outside, and sometimes seeming to hide within the elevator, which itself appears to be malfunctioning. The video went viral on the Internet, with many viewers reporting that they found it unsettling. Explanations ranged from claims of paranormal involvement to the bipolar disorder from which Lam suffered; it has also been argued that tampering had occurred with the video. The circumstances of Lam's death, when she was found, also raised questions, especially in light of the Cecil's history in relation to other notable deaths and murders. Her body was naked with most of her clothes and personal effects floating in the water near her. It took the Los Angeles County Coroner's office four months, after repeated delays, to release the autopsy report, which reports no evidence of physical trauma and states that the cause of death was accidental. Guests at the Cecil, now re-branded as Stay on Main, sued the hotel over the incident, and Lam's parents filed a separate suit later that year; the latter was dismissed in 2015. Some of the early Internet interest noted what were considered to be unusual similarities between Lam's death and plot elements from the 2005 horror film Dark Water. There have been efforts to fictionalize the case since then as well. Less than a year after her death, Hungry Ghost Ritual, a Hong Kong horror film, included a scene apparently inspired by the elevator video, and Chinese director Liu Hao announced he was planning a film based on her life and death, hopefully starring Gao Yuanyuan. An episode of Castle was inspired by it, and a horror film that uses the case as a backstory, The Bringing, began development under Sony Pictures Entertainment."
