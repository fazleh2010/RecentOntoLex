  "text" : "Elizabeth Putnam Sohier (1847–1926), a member of Boston's wealthy class, persuaded the Massachusetts Legislature to establish the Free Library Commission in 1890—the first of its kind in the United States. As a member of the Free Public Library Commission for thirty six years she worked tirelessly to ensure that every city and town in Massachusetts had a library. She also worked to encourage these libraries, once established, to expand collections and circulation. In 1952 the Commission was renamed the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners. Sohier was also active in the Woman's Education Association of Boston and instrumental in setting up a committee on libraries. The group established traveling libraries, a traveling picture collection, and collections of travel books. The WEA was responsible for encouraging other states to establish traveling libraries in states such as California, Iowa, Kansas, Wisconsin. Throughout her years of service Sohier found opportunities for libraries to be effective. During the 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike when it became apparent that many of the workers were foreign born Sohier worked with the Governor to obtain books for the strikers. During World War I the Commission worked with the American Library Association to provide library services to soldiers in camps. She was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Beverly Public Library for thirty years. Sohier wrote History of the Old South Church of Boston. Elizabeth Putnam Sohier was a member of the Mayflower Society and listed in the Register of the Massachusetts Society of the Colonial Dames of America, 1893-1927."

The artist fluctuated between epic, large-scale compositions and intimate canvases and worked with a variety of media from painting to experimental film. Pilgrim's oeuvre reflects the artist's various interests from avant-garde portraiture to the notion of the occult, which were all figured through a Modernist interest in coloration, abstraction, and expression."

Originally an author, he became involved in the film industry when his novels began to be optioned into films during the silent era of film, although his career was mostly during the sound era. In addition, he penned several Broadway plays as well. He married the daughter of famed cartoonist George Herriman, Barbara, and they had one daughter prior to Barbara's death from complications from surgery in 1939. In 1947, Pascal was hired by RKO Pictures to write a story based on the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804. However, Warner Brothers procured the rights to the script, but when production was delayed, it was eventually permanently shelved after Paramount produced their 1955 film based on the same event entitled, The Far Horizons."

He then furthered his education in Paris, Bonn and Heidelberg, returning to Louvain in 1868 as successor to Louis-Antoine Van Biervliet (1802–1868) as chair of physiology, a position he would hold without interruption up until 1914. During this time period, he was also a doctor at the Frères Alexiens asylum (from 1891), and in 1896, in addition to physiology, he began teaching classes in psychiatry at the university. He was a member of the Société médico-psychologique de Paris, the Société de Thérapeutique générale de France and the Société de Médecine mentale de Belgique. From 1890 to 1915, he was secrétaire perpétuel of the Académie royale de Médecine de Belgique. In 1903 he became part of the international commission to make presentations for the Nobel Prize in Medicine. In 1915, the main avenue in front of the Hôpital Brugmann in the municipality of Jette was named in his honour."

Melsheimer became (after Hilde Benjamin) the second most important state lawyer in the young country. Melsheimer was a strong believer in party control of the courts. (By now, only one political party, the SED, was permitted in East Germany). He was opposed to any Western-style separation of powers between the justice system and the state. He took a hands-on approach to his job, appearing in person as the principal (prosecution) advocate in numerous secret trials and in high-profile show trials during the 1950s."

  "text" : "Erich Pernice (19 December 1864, Greifswald – 1 August 1945, Freest) was a German classical archaeologist. He was the son of gynecologist Hugo Karl Anton Pernice (1829–1945). He studied classical philology in Berlin, and classical languages, history and archaeology at the University of Bonn, where his instructors included Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz and Heinrich Nissen. In 1888 he obtained his PhD with a dissertation titled Galen et de ponderibus mensuris testimonia. Through a travel grant from the Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts (DAI), he participated in the excavation at Kerameikos in Athens. In 1895 he began work at the Antikensammlung Berlin (Antiquarium), subsequently spending several years as a directorial assistant (1897-1903). In 1903 he was named an associate professor of archaeology and philological auxiliary sciences at the University of Greifswald, later attaining a full professorship (1907) and a directorate of the academic art collections. In 1908/09 he took part in two successful excavations at Miletus. In 1912 he was instrumental towards the founding of the \"Pompeii project\", a project that is still continued by the DAI today. In the field of metrology, he conducted research of ancient weights. After retirement in 1933, he continued to hold lectures at Greifswald until 1940."

  "text" : "Zandile Ellen Tshabalala also known as Ellen Tshabalala is a former Chairperson of the South African Broadcasting Corporation(SABC). She was appointed Chairperson of the Board in September 2013, having previously served for six months prior as acting SABC Chairperson. She resigned on Wednesday, 17 December 2014. In July 2014, it emerged that she allegedly lied on her CV when she applied for the post of Chairperson of the SABC. The CV she put before the parliamentary portfolio committee on communications, under which the SABC falls, said she graduated from the University of South Africa (UNISA) with a BCom and a postgraduate diploma in labour relations. This claim was repeated in a statement by the presidency of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, announcing her appointment. However, according to a Promotion of Access to Information Act application sent by the newspaper City Press, UNISA said Tshabalala had neither of the qualifications that she claimed. UNISA's executive director of legal services and information, Jan van Wyk wrote in a letter to the newspaper City Press: \"According to our records, no qualification was awarded to the mentioned individual.\" According to Jan van Wyk, she registered for a BCom degree in 1988 and again in 1996 but had failed to complete the course. She had also registered for a diploma in labour relations in 1995. In 2011, Mercedes Benz had requested confirmation of her qualifications from UNISA when she applied for a job there. The university had informed an intermediary of her failure to attain the qualifications she claimed. Parliaments Portfolio Committee on Communications inquiry that began on the 3rd December 2014 into her qualifications found her guilty on two charges. She was found guilty of misconduct for lying to Parliament about her qualifications. She was further found guilt of lying in a sworn affidavit she submitted to Parliament in lieu of her academic records. She had claimed to have lost her qualification certificates when she had been burgled. She had initially refused to resign, claiming that there was a political agenda behind her guilty verdict. She further claimed that \"elements within the alliance (Tripartite Alliance)\" were hell bent to purge and vilify her. \"I am not willing to resign because I did nothing wrong.\" Though there was no clear indication that the ANC played a role in her resignation, the National Executive Committee (African National Congress) took a decision to urge her to stop fighting and resign. At the time of the controversy, she was working on the following boards: \n*  The President’s Advisory Council on Broad-Based BEE \n*  Sishen Iron Ore Company \n*  Transnet Limited – SOC \n*  Transnet Foundation \n*  Cape Empowerment Limited \n*  Ascension Properties \n*  Port Shepstone Harbour Development Company \n*  Moral Regeneration Movement."

  "text" : "Eduard Isaac Asser (October 19, 1809 – September 21, 1894) was a lawyer and Dutch amateur photographer. Asser was born in Amsterdam and became a successful lawyer and was thus able to afford his photography hobby, which was very expensive at the time. His experiments with Daguerrotype were initially reproductions of academic art. He is best known for his efforts to make the photographic printing process cheaper, most notably with his patent on the Procédé Asser in 1858, a photolithography process. He was an editor of the Dutch photography magazine and member of the Amsterdam photographers' society Helios. Asser died in Amsterdam and he is considered the father of photography in the Netherlands. His descendants gave 200 of his earliest photos from 1839-1860 to the national collection in 1993. Since then they have been kept in the Rijksmuseum. Besides using art studio techniques for still lifes, Asser took many pictures of his family, most notably a childhood portrait of Tobias Asser."

Beilhardt remained at the central camp from 18 September 1944 until 11 October 1944 where she attended an overseer program for six weeks and was then moved to the satellite camp at Heiligenbeil. On 20 January 1945 Beilhardt accompanied the evacuation of prisoners to Königsberg where she performed nursing duties on injured German soldiers under the German Red Cross. Eventually, in 1945, she was again present at the main camp at Stutthof. Captured by Soviet troops after the war, Beilhardt was accused during the first 'Stutthof Trial' (25 April 1946–31 May 1946) of maltreatment of concentration camp prisoners and handed down a sentence of five years imprisonment. Her final fate remains unknown."

She was the daughter of the painter Emma Kehrmann (1867-1958). She studied art history at the universities of Frankfurt, Bonn and Munich, under Rudolf Kautzsch, who supervised her doctotate, and Heinrich Wölfflin. But she trained as a painter after taking her doctorate. She exhibited in Germany and, after emigrating to England in 1933 (her family was Jewish), in her new home as well. When her studio was destroyed in World War II, she returned to art history. She studied at the Courtauld Institute in London after the war, focusing on the artists of the Tudor court, and wrote a second dissertation on patronage and painting in 16th-century England. This would become the subject of her first published book, Tudor Artists (1954), the first work in modern times to lay out the documentary sources for the arts of painting and limning in the Tudor and Elizabethan periods. She died in London in 1975."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Anne Le Noir (born Elizabeth Smart; c. 1755 – May 6, 1841) was an English female poet, novelist, and feminist from the romantic period. Raised in a widowed home, Le Noir became interested in literature through opportunities she was given by her mother's step-father; John Newbery. After being employed at the Reading Mercury for some time, Le Noir and her sister eventually inherited it. Le Noir soon became the wife of Jean Baptiste Le Noir, from whom she got her last name. Although she didn't have any children of her own, she educated two of her female relatives. Although Le Noir had many great works, \"[s]he is probably better known as the daughter of the famous religious poet Christopher Smart.\""

  "text" : "Erasmus D. Hall (? - September 1878) was an American merchant from Wisconsin, who served in the 1st Wisconsin Legislature as a Whig, representing Winnebago County in the Wisconsin State Assembly. Hall was a native of Vermont, and came to Wisconsin Territory in 1838. Hall and his wife became among the earliest settlers of the Waukau area, arriving there in 1845 along with other members of Hall's extended family (John M., J. R. and Uriah Hall), and accompanied by their son Darwin Hall. He engaged in \"mercantile pursuits\". Hall held various public offices, including being elected the first chairman of the newly-organized Town of Rushford, Wisconsin and a frequent member of the county's board of supervisors (1847, 1850, 1853, 1855). In 1848, he was elected as a Whig to the single Assembly seat allocated to Winnebago County. He was succeeded in 1849 by fellow Whig Thomas J. Townsend. In 1856, the Halls moved to Grand Rapids in Wood County, Wisconsin; and later to Milwaukee, where they stayed about five years. In 1870, the Halls (including a son) moved to Mississippi, intending to plant cotton. After one season, they laid plans to return to Wisconsin, but Hall was offered the position of postmaster of Okolona, Mississippi. Due to health problems, he later moved to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, where in 1878 both of the Halls succumbed to yellow fever. Darwin Hall has already moved to Minnesota, and served in the Minnesota House of Representatives by this time; but his service in the Minnesota Senate and United States House of Representatives took place after their deaths."

  "text" : "Eric Allen (May 18, 1949 – October 27, 2015) was an American gridiron football player. He played college football for the Michigan State Spartans football team from 1969 to 1971 and professional football for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League from 1972 to 1975. A 1968 graduate of Howard High School in Georgetown, South Carolina, Allen gained over 3,000 combined rushing and passing yards for Michigan State. On October 30, 1971, Allen set an NCAA single-game record with 350 rushing yards on 29 carries in a 43-10 win over Purdue. He broke the prior record of 347 yards set by Ron Johnson of Michigan in 1968. During the 1971 season, Allen led the Big Ten Conference in both rushing yardage (1,410), yards from scrimmage (1,769), rushing yards per carry (5.8), and touchdowns (18). He was the first Big Ten player to score more than 100 points in a season. Allen finished 10th in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1971. Allen was drafted by the Baltimore Colts in the fourth round of the 1972 NFL Draft, but did not sign and played in the CFL for the Toronto Argonauts. During his rookie year with the Argonauts, he caught 53 passes for 1,067 yards and eight touchdowns. He also gained 220 rushing yards on 50 carries during the 1972 season. Allen died in hospice care at his hometown on October 27, 2015."

  "text" : "Ernest F. “Ernie” Newton (November 7, 1909 – October 17, 1976) was an American country music bass player. Newton was born in Hartford, Connecticut. By the age of five he had been orphaned and he then lived in several children's homes until the age of 15, when he ran away to appear across the US in various Minstrel shows. He worked as a musician on WLS Radio in the Chicago area, recording with “The Hill Toppers” before becoming a regular bassist for Fred Waring’s Pennsylvanians in 1935. It was whilst he was working for Waring that Newton met up initially with Les Paul, becoming an original member of the famed Les Paul Trio along with Jim Atkins (Chet Atkins' brother). Newton eventually became acquainted with well known singer Red Foley and travelled south to Nashville in 1946 as bass player in Foley’s band “The Foggy River Boys” when Foley was engaged to host the \"Prince Albert\" segment of the WSM Grand Ole Opry. In Nashville, Newton's reputation for versatility and professionalism landed him a spot as the Opry's \"house\" bass player and he became one of the most utilised session musicians in the country field of music between the late 1940s to the mid 1950s, featuring on numerous recording sessions at leading Nashville studios. At a time when drums were effectively taboo in country music, Newton was the first Nashville bassist to develop and master the technique of mounting a drum head to the bass for rhythmic effect when between plucking the strings he would hit the drum head with a brush held in his right hand. As a session man, Newton was prolific and can be heard on many of the most iconic country songs of the period such as I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and Lost Highway (Hank Williams), Making Believe (Kitty Wells), I'm Moving On (Hank Snow), There Stands the Glass (Webb Pierce), I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know (The Davis Sisters), Blue Moon Of Kentucky (Bill Monroe 1954) and Man of Constant Sorrow (The Stanley Brothers). Newton also introduced maracas into country music when he suggested to Johnnie Wright and Jack Anglin (Country duo “ Johnnie and Jack” ) that they should differentiate themselves from other similar groups by introducing the instrument into their 1951 song Poison Love. The result was a massive hit for the duo and a great feat of technical skill from Newton who played the bass and maracas simultaneously on the recording. Outside of music, Newton was a talented golfer and in the late 1950s he chose to curtail his musical career and became a golf professional at a country club in the Nashville area. Newton died in Nashville, Tennessee on October 17, 1976."

  "text" : "Eric Frank Penn (17 April 1878 – 18 October 1915) was an English soldier and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) between 1898 and 1903. He was born at Westminster, London and died in the fighting of the First World War near Loos, France. Eric Penn was the eldest son of William Penn, a cricketer and a businessman who ran the family engineering company of John Penn and Sons founded by his own father, John Penn, which was based in Greenwich, London. Eric Penn was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Penn played cricket as a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm slow bowler while at school. At Cambridge, he played in a few first-team games in 1898 but did not consolidate his place in the side and was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University. In 1899, he played regularly as a lower-order batsman and bowler and in the match against the MCC he took five second-innings wickets for 47 runs, the best bowling performance of his first-class cricket career. He was awarded a Blue, though he took only one wicket in the 1899 University Match. There was then a hiatus in Penn's university and cricket career, as he joined the 3rd battalion of the Royal Scots and served for two years as a Lieutenant seeing action in the Boer War. He returned to both Cambridge and cricket for the 1902 season, when he had less success as a bowler but more as a batsman, scoring 51 not out in the match against Ireland, his only half-century. He won a second Blue but again made little impact in the University Match. Penn appears to have left Cambridge University without taking a degree. He played in only one further first-class cricket match – a single game for MCC against Cambridge University in 1903. From 1899 to 1906 he played Minor Counties cricket for Norfolk, where his father had bought Taverham Hall near Norwich. On the outbreak of the First World War, Penn joined the Norfolk Yeomanry; he transferred to the 4th Battalion of the Grenadier Guards in April 1915 and was promoted to the rank of captain in September that year, a month before he was killed in the fighting of the Battle of Loos. In 1906, Penn married Gladys Eveleen Ebden, daughter of Charles Ebden of Baldslow Place near Hastings in East Sussex."

She advocated on behalf of female students at MIT and was influential in getting coeducational residencies, so that with more living options more female applicants could be accepted. Wick was also an avid sailor. She was the first woman commodore of the Sandy Bay Yacht Club in Rockport, Massachusetts. At MIT she helped create the women’s varsity sailing team which was the first in the county to fund a coaching position dedicated to women sailors. In her honor, MIT alumnae organized the annual Emily Wick Regatta and the Emily L. Wick trophy which eventually became the Intercollegiate Women's Sailing Championship trophy."

  "text" : "Ernest Charles François Babelon (* 7 November 1854 in Sarrey, Département Haute-Marne; † 3 January 1924 in Paris) was a French Numismatist and classical archaeologist. Ernest Babelon trained from 1874 to 1878 to be an archivist at the École Nationale des Chartes. He wrote his thesis on Les bourgeois du roi au Moyen Âge. From 1878 he worked for the Cabinet des Médailles. With Salomon Reinach he led excavations in North Africa in 1883. In 1890 he was appointed Deputy to the Director of the Cabinet des Médailles, Henri Michel Lavoix; two years later he was himself appointed Director of the museum and he remained in that position for 32 years, until his death in 1924. His successor was Adolphe Dieudonné. During the First World War he was responsible for sending the artistic treasures of the museum away for safekeeping and for gathering them back after the war. In 1902 he received an additional appointment as Lecturer for Numismatics and Glyptics, in 1908 he was appointed Professor with the chair for the Cours de numismatique antique et médiévale (course in ancient and medieval numismatics) at the Collège de France. That same year he was also appointed President of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. His son Jean Babelon was also Director of the Cabinet des Médailles. Babelon devoted himself initially to Medieval studies. His interest soon expanded to ancient numismatics, where he became a respected expert. In addition he was also a specialist in Ancient Near Eastern languages, working closely with his friend François Lenormant. Babelon became a central figure in French archaeology. He sat on several important committees and was co-editor of the Gazette archéologique. His numismatic work had two focuses: on the one hand he wrote numismatic catalogues and on the other he wrote syntheses of his individual studies in comprehensive works. His handbook Traité des monnaies grecques et romaines (Account of Greek and Roman Coinage) remained incomplete, he planned an account of all numismatic knowledge of his time based on the collection of William Henry Waddington. His corpus Recueil général des monnaies grecques d’Asie mineure (General Record of the Greek Coinage of Asia Minor), produced with Théodore Reinach, in which he synthesised all the mints of Asia Minor also remains incomplete. To this day the work is important to scholarship because of its comprehensiveness. At the end of the First World War he intervened in the political discourse about the Saargebiet with a two volume work about Rome and the Germans called Le Rhin dans l'histoire. (The Rhine in History). He was one of the leaders of the Comité d’études which existed from 1917 to 1918 and advanced the argument for the Saar belonging to France. Following the work of Paul Vidal de la Blache, he favoured a military protectorate, but misquoted Paul Vidal de la Blache. Babelon was esteemed and honoured many times. For his service to the Cabinet des Médailles he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour. In 1899 he was recognised with the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society and in 1922 with the Archer M. Huntington Medal."

  "text" : "Dr. Ernest Mercier, OC (1 March 1914 – 4 March 2002) was a reputed agronomist in Quebec, Canada. Born on a family farm in Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire, he went on to do graduate studies in Cornell University and founded the Artificial Insemination Centre of Quebec. After many years as the superintendent at a federal research farm, he was promoted deputy minister of agriculture of Quebec, a position which he held for 6 years. Retiring from his government work, he became a private consultant and collaborated with the Canadian International Development Agency and the Canadian delegation at the Food and Agriculture Organization on projects that took him around the world. Dr. Mercier has been credited among other things with the implementation of innovative agrifood policies that transformed the family farm of the past into the efficient and profitable modern operation of today. For his contribution to the agriculture and the field of agronomy, Dr. Mercier was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1989 and inducted to the Canadian Agricultural Hall of Fame in 1991 and the Agricultural Hall of Fame of Quebec in 1992."

Adams was born in August 1866 to George and Margaret Adams. At age 6, the family moved to a farm in Monroe County, where he attended school, and again, six years later, the family moved to a farm in Gratiot County. Adams' father was a distant relative of John and John Quincy Adams. He taught one term of school at age 17, later becoming employed by Hopkins & Lyon in Mt. Pleasant. Adams taught himself in the law and, after moving to Grand Rapids in 1892, was admitted to the bar in 1894. Adams' re-election in 1898 was not without controversy as he was opposed by Governor Hazen S. Pingree and members of his own political party. His election as Speaker in 1899 was similarly fraught, and described as \"one of the most bitter and determined fights ever witnessed.\" Adams served as a delegate to the convention which drafted the 1908 Michigan Constitution. He was a member of the Knights of Pythias."

  "text" : "Edward Khantzian is a professor of psychiatry, part time at Harvard Medical School. He is the originator of the self-medication hypothesis of drug abuse, which states that individuals use drugs in an attempt to self-medicate states of distress and suffering.Dr. Khantzian is a first generation Armenian-American born in Haverhill Massachusetts. His parents were born in Turkey, his father coming to this country in 1912 and his mother enduring a more potentially devastating experience of living through the Turkish genocide that started in 1915. Despite that tragic era, including the forced marches, she survived and joined with her husband to come to the United States in the late 1920s. Edward was born in 1935 and grew up in Haverhill, a shoe town, where both parents worked in the then flourishing shoe industry.Educated in local school systems, he began his advanced studies in the Evening Divisions of Merrimack College and Boston University, graduating from the latter in 1958. After working as a technical writer for Raytheon for one year, he commenced his medical training at Albany Medical College and graduated in 1963 followed by an Internship at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. Subsequently he commenced his training in psychiatry at the Harvard Massachusetts Mental Health Mental Center. Completing his training in Psychiatry he was one of the founders of the then newest Harvard Department of Psychiatry at The Cambridge Hospital with which he has been affiliated most of his career. He completed psychoanalytic training at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute in 1973. Starting early in his career he became involved in multiple clinical and investigative studies of addiction, with an emphasis on pursuing a psychodynamic understanding of the psychological vulnerabilities that predispose to addictive disorders. Considered a pioneer in addiction studies and treatment by many, he has gained world-wide recognition for originating the self-medication hypothesis and developing modified psychodynamic individual and group treatments for drug-alcohol dependent individuals, as well as exploring and explaining how and why 12-step programs are effective. He is a founding member and past-president of the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry, the founding member and chair of the Committee for Alcoholism and Addiction for the Group for Advancement of Psychiatry, and is a founding member and President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Medical Society’s affiliated program, Physician Health Services, Inc."

A native of Arkansas, Payne succeeded J. S. Bacon of Heflin in south Webster Parish. In 1936, Payne was unseated in a runoff election by Drayton R. Boucher, a 28-year-old educator from Springhill. Payne had led in the primary election with 2,183 votes to Boucher's 1,729. In third place was Floyd D. Culbertson, Jr., later the mayor of Minden from 1940 to 1942, with 1,181 votes. A fourth candidate, E. H. Bolin, a prominent member of the Webster Parish School Board and the father of later Representative and Judge James E. Bolin, finished last with 746 ballots. Both Payne and Boucher were supporters of the late Governor and U.S. Senator Huey Pierce Long, Jr. Boucher visited nearly every home in Webster Parish to achieve his narrow victory, 2,778 votes (52.9 percent) to Payne's 2,474 (47.1 percent). From 1912 to 1920, Payne had been the Ward 2 member of the Webster Parish Police Jury, the parish governing body akin to the county commission in other states. Payne and his wife, Mary E. Payne (1874-1945), are interred at Springhill Cemetery."

In the 1870 he went into business for himself, eventually founding the Columbia Herald, which became famous as \"America's model weekly.\" He also founded the E.W. Stephens Publishing Company. Stephens served as president of the board of curators for both the University of Missouri and Stephens College, which was named after his father James L. Stephens. In 1890 he was president of the Missouri Press Association where he would advocate for the creation of the Missouri State Historical Society and became its first president in 1898. His relationship with Walter Williams, who he employed at the Herald, would lead to the creation of the world's first school of journalism: the Missouri School of Journalism. Stephens chaired the commission responsible for the design and construction of the current Missouri State Capitol."

Hill bought the Thoroughbred race horse War Knight, a son of Preakness winner High Quest, as a foal \"with her $1500 life savings\". He went on to win 10 of 28 starts, including the 1944 Arlington Handicap. He was injured in 1945 and did not win any of his five 1946 starts leading up to the $100,000 added Santa Anita Handicap, which he proceeded to win in a photo finish. He retired to stud afterward."

  "text" : "Ercole Luigi Morselli (Pesaro, 19 February 1882 – Rome, 16 March 1921) was an Italian writer and dramatist. In Florence, where his family moved in 1891 following his father, a state counsel who died there in 1895, Morselli attempted to study medicine and literature, but in both cases he did not succeed and had to interrupt his studies. In the following years he had a very turbulent life, with many journeys first in Africa and Latin America, then also in England and France. Morselli was a friend of Giovanni Papini and Giuseppe Prezzolini. After his return to Italy, Morselli started his literary career, which was initially quite difficult, such that his mother had to support him for long time. In 1910 his tragicomedy Orione obtained a great success, but Morselli did not reach economic stability until 1919, with the success of Glauco, a drama given in Rome. Morselli was also film director and screenplayer. He died of tuberculosis in a Roman hospital in 1921. The works of Morselli are based on the classical myths, revisited from a modern viewpoint. His most successful works are Orione, a tragicomedy where the main character is a demigod with very unspiritual desires, and Glauco, which describes the story of a fisher who becomes god of the sea but discovers that power does not necessarily bring joy. Morselli, portraying antiheroes, represented an alternative to the spirit of D'Annunzio. With his short story La donna ragno (The spider woman, 1915), Morselli was in addition one of the precursors of the science fiction in Italy. His play Belfagor was used by Claudio Guastalla as subject for the libretto of the opera with the same title (1926) of Ottorino Respighi."

He took up AB Political Science at the University of the Philippines Diliman. He entered politics his home province, Agusan del Norte, just like his father the late Cong. Edelmiro Amante, by being elected as Provincial Governor in 2004. He was re-elected for three consecutive terms until 2013. As governor, he focused on improving the quality of education in the province and making it more accessible to the less privileged constituents, especially members of the indigenous groups. He distributed textbooks to all public elementary and secondary schools in the province and opened a scholarship program for indigent college students. He was also given the privilege to attend international seminars sponsored by the Government of Sweden and the US State Department 2006 and 2009 respectively. Taking public service to a higher level, he ran for Congressman and was elected last year representing the 2nd District of Agusan del Norte. He is a member of fifteen (15) House committees, including Basic Education and Culture, and serves as Vice Chairperson for the committees on Agrarian Reform, Information and Communications Technology, Natural Resources, and Small Business & Entrepreneurship Development. He is one of the most prolific neophyte lawmakers in the 16th Congress, having filed 31 house bills and resolutions and co-authored 30. Just last September 2014, Congressman Amante was awarded 2014 Outstanding Filipino Achiever in Public Service by the Golden Globe Awards for Business Excellence in recognition of his efforts to progressively develop Agusan del Norte."

  "text" : "Erich Meyer (born August 6, 1951) is an Austrian engineer, amateur astronomer and discoverer of asteroids. Between 1996 and 1999, using the private observatory Meyer/Obermair in Davidschlag (municipality Kirchschlag bei Linz, Austria), he discovered a total of 21 asteroids. Seven of these asteroids were discovered together with his colleague Erwin Obermair and one together with Herbert Raab. Furthermore, he was involved in six other discoveries of asteroids between 1996 and 2005, which were assigned as site discoveries to the observatory Davidschlag by the International Astronomical Union. Meyer's most important observations include precisie astrometry of the comet Shoemaker–Levy 9, which he observed together with Erwin Obermair and Herbert Raab in 1993. These observations have significantly contributed to the subsequent prediction of the impact of this comet on the planet Jupiter. On April 4, 1997, Meyer was presented the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria (Silver) of the republic of Austria. The asteroid 7940 Erichmeyer was named in his honor on June 10, 1998. In 2005, Meyer was awarded a \"Gene Shoemaker NEO Grant\" by the Planetary Society to support his work on near-Earth objects. Meyer is a member of the Astronomical Society of Linz (Linzer Astronomische Gemeinschaft). By profession, he works as an engineer in the field of maintenance of industrial plants."

  "text" : "Earl Bruce MacNaughton (1919 – January 5, 2015) was notable as the founding dean of the College of Physics at the University of Guelph. Earl MacNaughton was born near the town of Maple, Ontario in 1919. He attended primary school in Maple, commuted by train to Aurora for secondary school, and then attended the University of Toronto. He graduated from there with a Master's degree majoring Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in 1941. It was in the middle of World War II, and MacNaughton initially served as a civilian training Armed Forces personnel in electronics. Eventually, he joined the Royal Canadian Navy and served in the area of operational research. After the war, he returned to the University of Toronto and graduated with a Ph.D. in physics in 1948. MacNaughton then began teaching physics at the Ontario Agricultural College. In 1952, he was promoted to Head of the Physics Department. Soon after the Ontario Agricultural College was merged with the Ontario Veterinary College in 1964, he became the Associate Dean of Wellington College of Arts and Science at the newly formed University of Guelph. He was installed as the Dean of the College of Physical Sciences (later included Engineering) when it was first opened in 1970. The university renamed the main physical science building after him when he retired in 1981. “He was a tower of strength” at the university, said William Winegard, who was University of Guelph’s president from 1967 to 1975. “We would talk about what was needed, and he had lots of ideas, and he would just go out and do it. He was always thinking of the university and what was best for the university. Earl was one of the finest people you could ever meet,” and he was a “tremendous dean” who worked hard to make his college a topnotch school. He was a wonderful man, and you wouldn’t find anybody at the College of Physical Science who didn’t like their dean.” MacNaughton and his wife Jean (Robinson) had two daughters. Daughter Janis MacNaughton became a doctor of internal medicine in Stratford, Ontario, and daughter Liz Sandals became the Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario) for Guelph and rose to the cabinet post of Minister of Education."

  "text" : "Edward Brent Prest (4 January 1830 – 8 June 1903) was an English lawyer and a cricketer who played for Cambridge University, the Cambridge Town Club, and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in the 1850s. He was born in Stapleford, Cambridgeshire and died at Cambridge. Prest was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a lower-order batsman and, although full details of all of his matches are not available, he does not appear to have bowled or kept wicket in first-class games, though he bowled in minor matches. His first first-class appearance was the 1850 University Match against Oxford University and he scored only one run in his two innings. He played one further match for the university side in 1850, then three games for the Cambridge Town Club between 1852 and 1854 and two for the MCC, one each in 1855 and 1859. After the 1855 MCC match he had had nine innings in first-class cricket, scored 14 runs and been out every time; he blotted that record of solid under-achievement in his final match in 1859, however, by scoring an unbeaten 18 from his deserved position at the bottom of the batting order. He did not play again. Prest graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1852 and was called to the bar in 1855. He was a district auditor for the Local Government Board from 1863 to 1900 and lived first at Surbiton and then in Cambridge. Prest's brother William played cricket for Cambridge University in 1851 and for other amateur teams across the 1850s."

She is currently the Richard Lyman Professor in the Humanities at Stanford. Clark's research focuses on first language acquisition, especially the acquisition of meaning. She has done extensive observational and experimental research. She has also worked on the acquisition and use of word-formation, including comparative studies of English and Hebrew in children and adults. Some of her current studies examine what children can learn about conventional ways to say things based on adult responses to child errors during acquisition. She has studied the pragmatics of coining words."

  "text" : "Elizabeth Murchison is a British-Australian geneticist, currently working at the University of Cambridge, UK. The ongoing research of her group focuses on the known existing clonally transmissible cancers arising in mammals. These are cancers that can be passed on between individuals by the transfer of living cancer cells that somehow manage to evade the immune system of their hosts. There are two diseases which cause clonally transmissible cancers. One is the devil facial tumor disease (DFTD), which appeared a few decades ago. This disease could make the Tasmanian devil, a marsupial that lives on the Australian island of Tasmania, go extinct. The other disease is the much older Canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT), also known as Sticker sarcoma, a venereal tumor affecting dogs, which has spread worldwide. Elizabeth Murchison and her collaborators have been analyzing the genome of these cancer cells.This has enabled them to show that CTVT must have emerged in a female dog more than 10000 years ago.The study of these two long-lived cancers als provides more general insight into the genetic evolution of cancer. Elizabeth Murchison has received several awards for her research, such as the Philip Leverhulme Prize, the Cancer Research UK Future Leaders in Cancer Research Prize, the British Association for Cancer Research-AstraZeneca Young Scientist Frank Rose Award, the Genetics Society Balfour Prize Lecture (2014), and the Eppendorf Award for Young European Investigators (2012). Elizabeth Murchison’s 2011 TED talk titled \"Fighting a contagious cancer\" has been viewed more than 450,000 times."

He was born in Clapham, then in Surrey, and died at Ambleside, then within Westmorland. Reynolds was educated at the Liverpool Institute and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he played as a lower middle order batsman and a bowler for Liverpool Cricket Club in non-first-class matches from 1848; neither his bowling nor his batting style are known. At Cambridge, he played in four first-class matches, and two of them were the University Matches of 1853 and 1854 against Oxford University; Oxford won both of those games convincingly. Reynolds graduated from Cambridge University in 1855 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England and served as curate of Trinity Church, Stockton-on-Tees from 1855 to 1862. From 1863 to 1876, Reynolds held various posts as a schoolmaster at St Peter's College, Radley, Clifton College and Haileybury College. He then retired to the Lake District where he was Master of Foxhounds of the Coniston pack and had a reputation for other sports, including sailing and ice-skating; his merits in these and more clerical pursuits were the subject of some ill-tempered correspondence in the Yorkshire Post after his death in 1908."
