  "text" : "Freeman Wood (July 1, 1896 – February 15, 1956) was an American character actor of the silent and sound film eras. Born in 1896 in Denver, Colorado, he would appear in his first film in 1919, The Adventure Shop. Early in his career he would have larger roles, often as the rival love interest to the main character, but his roles would get smaller and smaller as time went on. By 1933 he was relegated to what amounted to as bit parts, with his character often being unnamed. Over his 25-year career he would appear in over 60 films, the last of which was in a small role in 1944's Once Upon a Time, starring Cary Grant, Janet Blair, and James Gleason."

Schauwecker grow up in a musical family, and in his youth, he became a fan of New Orleans Jazz. At the end of the 1950s, he learned to play the jazz trombone. His idols at that time being Kid Ory and Chris Barber. After finishing school, he successfully concluded a training in advertising. Following his military service with the German Bundeswehr, he worked in Düsseldorf for a major English company in the pharmaceutical branch as advertising manager. After that he worked for many years as marketing communications manager of an American concern which worldwide was operating in the field of process technology. In 1962 he became active as an amateur musician and played with popular jazz-musicians over years. In the starting phase he played with music star and composer Udo Lindenberg, who stayed in his house for a short time. In 1968 he founded The Jolly Jazz Orchestra, which has existed until today, concentrating on swing and Dixieland. With this band Schauwecker 1993 played a lot of gigs in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. They had an invitation to play there for their 25th anniversary. The band, which, after a single (1975), released thirteen albums and several DVDs, and played in among other places, e.g. the Azores, the Canary Islands, Mallorca, and Benelux countries, and they had invitations to Beijing and Hong Kong. In later years, Schauwecker has been interviewing many musicians and their contemporaries about traditional jazz and swing music. In more than ten years he collected that information and published it in articles in German jazz magazines and 2013 in his book So war's wirklich (That's How It Really Was), together with other stories, telling the history of many evergreens of this music. In 2015 the book was updated to Let's go to the Best od Jazz"

Later he was a fellow at St. John's College at Cambridge University. He was ordained in the Anglican Church. From 1857 until 1892, he was the school rector at Minting in Lincolnshire. Between 1864 and 1880 he undertook some systematic ballistics experiments that studied the resistance of air. He invented a ballistic chronograph. He received an award from the British government in the amount of 2000 pounds. At times, he was also a professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He also studied liquid drops and surface tension. The Adams–Bashforth method (a numerical integration method) is named after John Couch Adams (who was the 1847 Senior Wrangler) and Bashforth. They used the method to study drop formation in 1883."

Born in Washington, D.C., the only child of Minnie Tomlinson and Frederick Kroeber, Sparrow attended local schools and developed an early interest in science. It was during these years he met Jack Faber, who later became a microbiologist and lacrosse coach. Sparrow earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1925, and entered Harvard University as a graduate student that year. He obtained a master's degree in 1926 and his PhD from this institution three years later. Sparrow served under various positions for the Mycological Society of America, including Secretary-Treasurer from 1945–1948, Vice-President in 1948, and President in 1949. He was also the President of the Michigan Academy of Arts, Sciences, and Letters in 1954. Sparrow was awarded the Award of Merit by the Botanical Society of America in 1968, the same year he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Sparrow died in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1977. The standard author abbreviation Sparrow is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

Holleman was born in Seneca, South Carolina and attended Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. He graduated from Harvard Law School and served as a law clerk for Judge Harrison Lee Winter of the Fourth Circuit and Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun. He then worked as a partner at Wyche, Burgess, Freeman and Parham in Greenville, South Carolina. Holleman served as chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party from 1988–90. In 1994, he was appointed by President Bill Clinton to serve in the Justice Department as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and later served as Chief of Staff for Secretary of Education Richard Riley. In 1999, Clinton recess appointed Holleman to serve as Deputy Secretary of Education, a post which he held until the end of the Clinton presidency. Holleman served as campaign manager for Inez Tenenbaum's Senate campaign in 2004, and was rumored as a possible candidate for state Superintendent of Education in 2006. He did not run and Jim Rex won the Democratic nomination and the general election. After Rex decided not to run for re-election and instead ran for governor, Holleman announced his candidacy for Superintendent in the 2010 election. Holleman opposed tax credits or publicly funded vouchers for private school tuition, and supported an expansion of early childhood education and adoption of the Common Core Standards. He won the Democratic nomination against school administrator Tom Thompson. In the general election, Holleman raised a substantial amount of money, and the race was initially considered to be close, but he lost the general election to Republican nominee Mick Zais. Holleman is now a senior litigating attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, where he has led the effort to litigate against power utilities over the disposal of coal ash, especially in the wake of the 2014 Dan River coal ash spill."

In the 2003 bestselling book The Devil in the White City Frank Geyer is described as a \"big man with a pleasant, earnest face\". His wife and daughter were killed in a fire a short time before he started investigating the Holmes case. Son of Reuben K.

An early disciple of Paul de Lagarde, Lange was part of the Burschenschaft movement and absorbed the strong strain of German nationalism rife within that tendency. In the 1890s Lange became convinced that the Jewish influence in schools was too strong and he played a leading role in organising a petition for school reform, aimed at increasing the teaching of German studies and minimising Jewish influence through the School Reform Association, which he led with Theodor Peters. He was also close to Carl Peters and the Society for German Colonization."

  "text" : "Fumiko Hayashida (January 21, 1911 – November 2, 2014) was an American activist, originally from Bainbridge Island, Washington, who became one of the first Japanese American to be interned in March 1942. Hayashida, who was 31 years old at the time, was the subject of a Seattle Post-Intelligencer photograph which shows her holding her sleeping 10-month-old daughter, Natalie, while waiting to board a ferry from Bainbridge Island to the mainland with other Japanese American internees. The photo became an iconic image of the plight of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans who were interned during World War II. However, the identity of the woman in the photograph remained unknown for decades. She was known only as \"Mystery Girl\" or \"Mystery Lady\" until the 1990s, when researchers at the Smithsonian Institution uncovered her identity and tracked her down. Hayashida was interned for a year at Manzanar before being moved to the Minidoka internment camp in Idaho to be closer to relatives and friends. In 2006, Hayashida testified in favor of a proposed memorial for Japanese American internees on Bainbridge Island before a U.S. congressional committee. The Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial was opened in 2011."

He was born at the Château de Frédière at Saint-Barbant in Haute-Vienne in the Limousin region of France. He studied under Henri Duveyrier, the Saharan explorer, who developed Foureau's own interest in the subject. Once in the Sahara, Foureau carried out the first artesian well drilling for the company Oued RIHR and then became famous for his numerous study trips in the desert from 1882, which earned him several awards from the French Société de géographie. Between 1888 and 1896 he also made nine expeditions to southern Algeria to study the feasibility of a trans-Saharan railway line from Ouargla to In Salah. From 1898 to 1900 he undertook the long journey from Ouargla to Lake Chad with Army officer Amédée-François Lamy, known as the Foureau-Lamy Mission, which was part of the French strategy to conquer Chad and unify all French dominions in West Africa. He made maps, established trans-Saharan routes and performed numerous geographical and meteorological surveys. In 1901 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the French Société de Géographie. In 1906 he was appointed Governor of Mayotte and Comoros and from 1908 to 1913 served as Governor of Martinique."

  "text" : "Frank Mace MacFarland (1869–1951) was an American malacologist associated with Stanford University in California. Born in Centralia, Illinois, MacFarland attended DePauw University (A.B. 1889), Stanford University (A.M., 1893) and the University of Wurzburg (PhD, 1896). On August 27, 1902, MacFarland married Olive Knowles Hornbrook (b.30 June 1872, West Virginia; B.L. 1893, Ohio Wesleyan University; A.B. 1908, Stanford; d. 1 May 1962, San Mateo, California). Mrs. MacFarland was a skilled technician and artist whose delicate watercolor paintings illustrated many of his scientific publications. Frank MacFarland was an authority on the life and habits of nudibranchs and he left unfinished a comprehensive monograph on the group which was published posthumously in 1966. He played a leading role in organizing the Hopkins Seaside Laboratory (now Hopkins Marine Station) in Pacific Grove, California, of which he was in charge from 1910 to 1913 and co-director from 1915 to 1917, and in which he maintained an active interest throughout the remainder of his life. MacFarland served as President of the California Academy of Sciences from 1934 to 1946; his research collection of opisthobranch mollusks formed the basis of the Academy's invertebrate collection. In 2006, the MacFarland home on the Stanford campus (designed in 1914 by Arthur Bridgman Clark) was added to the National Register of Historic Places."

  "text" : "Frank Hardart Sr. was born in Bavaria in 1850. He emigrated to America in 1858 with his widowed mother, an older brother and two sisters, and settled in New Orleans, Louisiana. He started out washing dishes and cooking in restaurants. While working at a lunch counter at age 13, he learned the French-drip coffee brewing method – a departure from the boiled coffee common at time. The French-drip coffee was later credited as part of Horn & Hardart's early success. In 1876, Hardart bought a one-way ticket to Philadelphia, with the idea of introducing New Orleans' French-drip coffee to a new market. Philadelphia had the Centennial Exhibition that year and the city's restaurants were flush with out of town visitors. Hardart took a job washing dishes and did his best to sell the idea of French-drip coffee to restaurants, but there were no takers. He returned to New Orleans and waited tables in restaurants, saving what money he could. He met and married a young Irishwoman named Mary Bruen and in 1886, they moved to Philadelphia to continue Hardart's dream of introducing a better cup of coffee to the masses. He was working at a luncheonette called Joe Smith's in 1888 when he answered an advertisement by Joseph V. Horn (1861–1941), who was looking for a restaurant partner. Horn, who came from a wealthy family in Philadelphia, had borrowed $1,000 from his mother to place the ads. \"Horn got only one answer: three words, scribbled on a scrap of paper, stuffed in an envelope with a boarding house return address on it. Frank Hardart had sent it. He'd been working in a quick lunch (sandwich shop) called Joe Smith's when he saw Horn's ad. He tore off the corner of a bag of sugar, wrote, 'I'm your man' on it, and mailed it.\" On December 22, 1988, Horn and Hardart opened their first restaurant together in Philadelphia and in 1898, they incorporated as the Horn & Hardart Baking Company. Horn & Hardart's success grew as they opened lunchrooms on busy street corners in commercial areas of Philadelphia. Horn had been inspired by a visit to a new \"waiterless restaurant\" in Boston called, \"Thompson's Spa.\" But it wasn't until Hardart traveled to Berlin in 1900 to find out more about the German version, called \"automats,\" that their own business changed. Frank Hardart purchased the machinery for $30,000, a huge sum at the time, from a German company called Quissana, so Horn & Hardart could set up their own Automat in Philadelphia. The equipment took a year to build. Unfortunately, the ship carrying Horn & Hardart's new machine, collided with another ship and sank. The equipment was insured, but Horn & Hardart had to wait another year for a replacement. They opened their first Automat on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia in June 2, 1902. In 1905, they opened a second Automat in Philadelphia, in 1907 a third and in 1912, a fourth. Frank Hardart Sr.'s son, Frank Hardart Jr.'s patented inventions helped perfect and expand the Automat. Frank Hardart Jr. rolled out Horn & Hardart's New York operations. He also took over for his father after Frank Hardart Sr. died in 1918."

  "text" : "Frederick Charles William Newman (1896-1966) was an English cricketer whose first-class career spanned three decades between the two World Wars. Newman was a right-handed opening or middle order batsman. He was born on 2 February 1892 in Luton, Bedfordshire and educated at Bedford Modern School where he first played for the first XI at the age of 13. In 1912, whilst still at school, he was selected to play for Bedfordshire and in 1914 played for the Leicestershire second XI. After the War Newman joined Surrey and in 1919 made his debut against Cambridge University at Kennington Oval, scoring 54 in the county's first innings. Surrey's powerful batting line-up at this time included Jack Hobbs, Andrew Sandham, Andy Ducat and Percy Fender and Newman was unable to secure a regular first-team place; playing in only five of their first-class matches up to 1921 when he left the county. He also played a single first-class match for H.D.G. Leveson-Gower's XI in 1919 against Oxford University. In 1926 he was appointed Private Secretary to Sir Julien Cahn, the retail magnate and cricket benefactor. Newman was responsible for organising Cahn's invitational side, including its overseas tours from 1928. Sir Julien Cahn's XI was accorded first-class status between 1932–38, and Newman played several matches, making his highest score of 101 against Leicestershire at West Bridgford in 1935. After Cahn's death in 1938 Newman continued to play competitive cricket and turned out for Nottinghamshire in non-first-class matches between 1942-44. In all, Newman scored 442 first-class runs at an average of 23.26, making one century and two fifties. He was also an occasional right-arm bowler and took one first class wicket at the cost of 80 runs. Frederick Newman died on 1 January 1966 at Malpas, Cornwall."

He would make his feature film debut with a small role in 1930's Leathernecking, a musical comedy starring Irene Dunne. He would appear in over 90 more feature films during his almost 25-year career. Some of the more notable films he appeared in were: Anything Goes (1936), starring Bing Crosby and Ethel Merman; the 1937 Tyrone Power vehicle, Alexander's Ragtime Band; the Michael Curtiz film Yankee Doodle Dandy (1943), starring James Cagney; 1946's Night and Day, the Cole Porter biopic starring Cary Grant, Alexis Smith, and Monty Woolley; Vincente Minelli's Father of the Bride (1950), starring Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, and Elizabeth Taylor; and the 1951 comedy, Angels in the Outfield. His final appearance would be in the big budget musical, The Farmer Takes a Wife (1953), which would be released after his death. Santley would die on May 14, 1953, in Los Angeles, California."

In 1941, the Bishop of Münster, August von Galen , publicly denounced the Nazi “euthanasia” program in a sermon, and telegrammed his text to Hitler. Franz Bornewasser also sent protests to Hitler, though not in public. Documents prepared by the American OSS, and used in evidence at the Nuremberg Trials, record that the Nazis were cautious with regard to the murder of church leaders, and conscious of not wanting to create martyrs. Nevertheless, Catholic leaders frequently faced violence or the threat of violence, particularly at the hands of the SA, the SS or Hitler Youth. A number of cases were cited by the OSS, including two attacks against Bishop Bornewasser of Trier."

  "text" : "Frederick William Poland (10 October 1858 – ?1940) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played in one first-class cricket match for Cambridge University in 1881. He was born at Shepherd's Bush, London. His death is less certain; in one source, he was living in 1940, the year of his apparent death, at Town of Mount Royal, Montreal, Canada, though the exact date and circumstances of death are not known. In the record of his parish at Mount Royal, however, his death is given as 1937, again with no detail (and the church has his birth-year wrong, claiming he was born in 1859). The fourth son of the Rev. Frederick Poland, a Church of England clergyman who was vicar of Paignton, Devon from 1861 to 1891, Poland was educated at a private school called Newton College in Devon and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He played cricket for club and amateur teams in Devon, and also played in a trial match at Cambridge University in 1881, when he batted low down in a line-up of 16 batsmen against the preferred university first team, and scored 31 and 13. A right-handed batsman and a wicketkeeper, he was picked for only one first-class game, the match against the \"Gentlemen of England\" amateur team, and made an unbeaten four in his only innings; he also made two catches and three stumpings as wicketkeeper. He was not picked again in first-class cricket, but he continued to play in less important games, including matches for Devon and Hertfordshire, and some of his Hertfordshire games from the mid 1890s were in the Minor Counties competition. Poland graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1882. Like his father, he became a Church of England clergyman, and he was curate at Stevenage, Hertfordshire, from 1884 to 1892. From 1904, he was based in North America and from 1912 until his retirement in 1933 he was a priest at churches in Montreal."

  "text" : "Fred Halsted (July 17, 1941 - May 9, 1989) was an American gay pornographic film director, actor, escort, publisher, and sex club owner. His films Sex Garage and L.A. Plays Itself are the only gay pornographic movies in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, where they were screened before a capacity audience on April 23, 1974. A screening of L.A. Plays Itself was sponsored by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art on February 28, 2013 and another took place on December 16, 2011 at the Los Angeles art gallery Human Resources. His films have also been shown the Netherlands Film Museum and in competition at The Deauville Film Festival. \"Halsted more or less created the world of gay sexual art and experimentation. He then watched it, and himself, be destroyed by AIDS, a sanitizing of gay sexual tastes and the power of addiction.\" Halsted was a sex radical. He believed that the erotic is transgressive and sacramental, that it is inherently violent and involves acts of violation. “Sex is not ‘coming,’ that is superficial sex,” he once explained. “Mine is personal cinema. I don’t fuck to get my rocks off. In the best scenes I’ve ever had, I haven’t come. I am not interesting in coming. … I am interested in getting my head off, my emotions off.\""

A native of Indianapolis, Beckwith was born in 1904 to former slaves. He graduated from Arsenal Technical High School in 1921, and published the Indianapolis Tribune for a time in the 1920s. He joined the Republican party in 1928. In 1943 he gave a radio address, \"The Negro Lawyer and the War,\" which was subsequently published in book form by the American Bar Association. He competed in the 1964 Republican Presidential Primary in Indiana. He urged the Republican Party to \"re-evaluate and strengthen its position with labor as well as minorities\" and called attention to the denial of voting rights and persecution of African Americans in the South. Barry Goldwater won the Indiana Republican primary. Prior to running for president, Beckwith ran unsuccessfully for the Indiana General Assembly and Indianapolis City-County Council. In 1964 he married Dr. Robbie Collins Goolsby Ed. D., an educator, founding member and president of the Board of Directors of Martin University and recipient of the Sagamore of the Wabash Award (1985). He was earlier married to Mahala Ashley Dickerson, a lawyer from Mississippi, who became the first black female attorney in Indianapolis and the second in the state of Indiana."

In Munich he studied with the pioneering folklorist Friedrich von der Leyen. In Berlin he made his publishing debut with Sprache und Stil im Wälschen Gast des Thomasin von Circlaria (\"Language and style in 'The Romansh Guest' by Thomasin von Zirclaere\"). His term at the University of Strassburg produced his work of German folktales, Der Erloser in der Wiege; ein Beitrag zur Deutschen Volkssagenforschung (\"The Redeemer in the cradle: a contribution towards German folktale research\", 1911). From 1912 Ranke was occupied as a tutor in Göttingen, After returning from his service at the front in World War I he was appointed assistant professor there in German philology, and then in 1921 full professor in German philology at the University of Königsberg; in 1930 he occupied the same position at the University of Breslau, whence, silenced by the Nazis in 1937, he removed to the University of Basel, Switzerland, as professor of German philology, where he remained until his death."

  "text" : "Fortunato Catalon (born 14 October 1897) was a Filipino track and field sprinter. Born in Tolosa, Leyte, Catalon came from a family of rural farmers. He took up sports at Leyte High School, but failed in his initial attempts to join the school's track team. He took up baseball, but his talents for getting quickly to the bases were noticed and he began to train as a sprinter. A short man, his advantage over his rivals was that he was a quick starter. At a time when sprinting technique was less defined, Catalon—like most of his national peers—used to raise his arms in the air and push his chest forwards when crossing the finish line (as opposed to the lean-in technique which later became common). He established himself as Asia's top sprinter at the age of nineteen by completing a double in the 100-yard dash and the 220-yard dash at the 1917 Far Eastern Championship Games in Tokyo. The third edition of the competition, he continued Filipino dominance in the sprints, becoming the second man to win that double (after Pio Robillos' wins in 1913) and succeeding teammates Genaro Saavedra and Nicolas Llaneta from the 1915 tournament. Fortunato's winning time of 10.0 seconds in the 100 yards was a new games record while his time of 23.8 seconds in the 220 yards was two tenths off Robillos tournament best. He returned to defend his title at the 1919 Manila Games and successfully did so by equalling his 100-yard record and bettering his 220-yard time to 23.0 seconds. Catalon continued his success at the Far Eastern Championship Games with two further successive sprint doubles at the 1921 Shanghai Games and then the 1923 Manila Games. A 220-yard games record of 22.2 seconds came at the latter edition. A run of 9.8 seconds in March 1923 ranked him sixth in the world rankings for the 100-yd dash that year. Upon meeting him while touring the Philippines, world record holder Charley Paddock of the United States called Catalon a \"champion of champions\". News of his near-world record runs spread to Western media through Fred England and Elwood Brown – the Americans who led the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association. His feats encouraged interest in the country of sending a Philippines team for the first time for the 1924 Paris Olympics. In the end it was another sprinter, his rival David Nepomuceno, that became the first Filipino to compete at the Olympics and he composed the entire one-man 1924 Filipino squad. Catalon was entered for the men's Olympic 100 metres and 200 metres, being drawn alongside America's Paddock in the former, but did not attend the games or start in those events. It was his team mate Nepomuceno that finally broke his unbeaten regional status at the 1925 Far Eastern Championship Games held in Manila. While Catalon won a fifth straight title in the 100 metres, he was beaten into second place by Nepomuceno in the 200 metres. This brought Catalon's tally of individual medals at the competition to nine – a record in the athletics section by a margin of two (over Mikio Oda's seven eventual titles). Following his retirement he became an official in the sport, acting as a race starter. His first major event in this role was at the 1934 Far Eastern Championship Games in Manila, where his compatriot Rafael de Leon became the last ever Far Eastern 100 metres champion. He was the starter for the 100 m final for the 1954 Asian Games, also held in Manila, and his lenient starting approach favoured Genaro Cabrera – the Filipino silver medallist. Catalon studied into his twenties and eventually received a college diploma from the University of Santo Tomas in Manila. He had a family, including two daughters – Gloria and Jovita. He was touted as a potential early 20th century candidate for admission into the Philippine Sports Hall of Fame."

  "text" : "Fiona Cumming (9 October 1937 – 1 January 2015) was a Scottish television director, noted for her work on the BBC television series, Doctor Who, during the show's Fifth Doctor era. Her credits included the 1982 episode, Castrovalva, the Season 19 premiere which marked the debut of Peter Davison as the show's fifth Doctor. Her other work with the show included Snakedance in January 1983 and Enlightenment in March 1983 for season 20. Cumming shot much of the 1984 serial, Planet of Fire, on location in Lanzarote, Canary Islands. Cumming was raised in Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland. She began her career as an actress at the Royal Scottish Academy. She appeared in both film and television. Her early roles included an episode of the BBC television series, Dr. Finlay's Casebook, in 1963. She also worked as an announcer on Border Television (present-day ITV Border). She transitioned from acting to television production in 1964. She had initially applied to the BBC and taught school in Scotland before breaking into production. She recalled her entry into the industry in a 2014 interview, telling Scotland Now, \"I had applied to the BBC in 1964 when they were getting ready for BBC2, and I had been accepted - but they lost my file and because I had a teaching degree, I came back up to Glasgow and started teaching at Bellahouston Academy. I can remember in 1963 when the kids came in, talking about this brilliant TV show they had seen the Saturday night before, and I said, 'What do you mean, it's set in a police box?'...Then in 1964 I went to the BBC as a relief assistant floor manager, where you were slotted into various programmes. I was doing the twice-weekly soaps Compact and Swizzlewick, and the first time I was moved on to something different it was Doctor Who.\" In 1965, she was hired as an assistant floor manager on the set of The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve. \"I was put onto The Massacre in 1965 - so it's now 48 years since I first worked on Doctor Who. Peter Purves was William Hartnell's assistant at that time and the director was Paddy Russell, who had such a great reputation,\" she recalled in 2014. Cumming later worked as a production assistant for several episodes of Doctor Who during the 1960s and 1970s, including The Highlanders, The Seeds of Death, and The Mutants. In 1974, Cumming was hired as a staff television director for the BBC. She directed episode's for some of the BBC leading dramatic series during the 1970s, including Angels, Play for Today, Z-Cars, and The Omega Factor, a short-lived series which aired in 1979. In 1980, Cumming directed two episodes of Blake's 7 during the show's third season, Sarcophagus and Rumours of Death. Cumming was booked to direct The Ultimate Evil during Doctor Who's 23rd season in 1986, but the production was cancelled when the show was put on hiatus. While she did not direct additional episodes on Doctor Who, she maintained a working relationship with the show 's producer, John Nathan-Turner, and collaborated with him at Teynham Productions. In 1988, Cumming made a cameo appearance as a tourist at Windsor Castle in Silver Nemesis for Doctor Who's 25th season. She also oversaw the re-edit of her 1983 serial, Enlightenment, for its re-release as part of the Black Guardian Trilogy DVD box set in 2009 as well as the re-edit of her 1984 serial, Planet of Fire for its re-release as part of the Kamelion Tales DVD box set in 2010. Fiona Cumming, who resided in Dumfries and Galloway, died on 1 January 2015, at the age of 77. She was survived by her husband, Ian."

He was born in Lutterworth, Leicestershire and died at Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex. In some sources and on census returns, his first name is spelled \"Frederick\". Price was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler. He played in three matches in the 1873 season and appeared in the trial for the Cambridge eleven in 1874, but his only first-class game that season was for an England XI against the university side, and he did not play again. Price graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1875, converting it to a Master of Arts in 1881. He became a priest in the Church of England and was curate at Bray, Berkshire to 1884. He then became a schoolmaster at Ovingdean Hall School near Brighton, at that time a preparatory school, but he returned to church duties as vicar of Bedwyn, Wiltshire from 1909 and then, from 1911 to 1922, as rector of Stanton St Quintin, also in Wiltshire.

From 1926–59, he ran the Timberscombe Guest House near Midhurst, West Sussex. It was much frequented after World War II by people on field courses led by the geologist, geomorphologist and geographer Sidney Wooldridge, of King's College London. Goldring was a hobby photographer with his own darkroom, whose pictures were published in guide books and at photographic exhibitions. In 1953, he co-authored with Wooldridge The Weald, a book in the New Naturalist series. As of January 2015, he remains the only photographer to have been named as an author in that series. \"[T]he match of plates and text in this book is a good deal better than average, and the splendid pictures have a consistency of style from being the work of a single person.\""

  "text" : "Fernand Baudin (1918, Deinze – 2005) was a Belgian book designer, author, and typographer. He was active in the field of international graphic design in many ways. Next to his activity of book designer, or “typographiste”, term that he was using to qualify himself, Fernand Baudin was the author of many articles on graphic design, and he wrote and designed two books, How Typography Works (And why it is important) and L'Effet Gutenberg at the end of his career, that sum up his ideas on writing and designing. Fernand Baudin was also a teacher and a lecturer, and he was active in national and international typographic organisations, like ATypI (Association Typographique Internationale), the Graphica Belgica Prize, and Rencontres internationales de Lure, for which he co-initiated a series of publications \"Les Dossiers de Lure\". Fernand Baudin dedicated a huge part of his work to the importance of writing, and particularly hand-writing, in graphic design (from the draft to the final copy) and in society in general. Fernand Baudin donated his whole library and archive to the Université Libre de Bruxelles in 2002, and thus helped create the Fonds Fernand Baudin. The Fonds includes more than 50 folders containing his correspondence over the second half of the 20th century, together with manuscripts, typescripts, and proofs and copies of articles that he authored over the same period. He died on the 18 July 2005. Three years after his death, the Prize for the Most Beautiful Books in Brussels and Wallonia was named in his honour, the Fernand Baudin Prize."

He was one of King Frederick the Great's most active and most treasured officers. Twice wounded and left for dead on the battlefield, he covered the name Forcade de Biaix in glory. Together with his wife, he fathered 23 children. He was Regimentschef of the 23rd Prussian Infantry Regiment, recipient of the Kingdom of Prussia's highest military order of merit for heroism, Knight of the Order of Pour le Mérite, Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle, Canon (Domherr) of Havelberg, Castellan (Drost) in Neuenrade in the County of Mark, Lord Seneschal (Amtshauptmann) of Zinna, President of the Ober-Collegium Sanitatis in Berlin and Lieutenant governor of Breslau. In 1851, his name was immortalized on the north facing commemorative plaque on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin. Friedrich Wilhelm Quirin von Forcade de Biaix is referred to in some historical sources, as the Marquis de Biaix. As with his father, there is no evidence that he was ever a Marquis. Biaix was not a marquisate, but instead a noble fief (see also Manorialism)."

  "text" : "F. David Farnell (born 1958) is an American New Testament scholar, Christian minister and professor of New Testament studies at The Master's Seminary in Sun Valley, California. He promotes a conservative approach to New Testament studies. Farnell's works include the book The Jesus Crisis: The Inroads of historical Criticism into Evangelical Scholarship and The Jesus Quest: The Danger from Within. His writings on biblical inerrancy have been endorsed by John F. MacArthur, Albert Mohler, and Paige Patterson. He is also the pastor of Grace Bible Church in Oxnard, California. He is a contributor and editor for the blog Defending Inerrancy, as well as \"Historical\" Jesus Search Report, where he writes on his views of the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible. He is also the host of The Danger Zone on World View Weekend Radio Network. During the 2014 National Apologetics Conference, Farnell addressed the current state in New Testament scholarship. In his lecture, The Battle for the Bible: Responding to the New Attacks on Scripture, he criticized the New Testament scholars Robert H. Gundry, Michael Bird, Craig Blomberg, as well as the apologist William Lane Craig. He has been criticized by Michael Licona for his conservative views. Farnell supports the historical-grammatical method in New Testament studies, and specializes in the impact of historical-critical philosophical ideologies in Biblical Criticism and interpretation of the New Testament. He opposes what he regards as a liberal approach to the study of the Bible, and promotes the Protestant doctrine of biblical inerrancy."
