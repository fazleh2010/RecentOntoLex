  "text" : "George Duval Buffett (November 19, 1928 – October 13, 2012) was an American politician who was a Republican member of the New Mexico House of Representatives from 1979 to 2002. Buffett attended University of New Mexico and was a businessman. He died in 2012. He was an arch-conservative state representative, owner of Buffett's Candy and cousin of Warren Buffett. George's interest in politics stemmed from his uncle, congressman Howard Homan Buffett. He attended the Republican National Convention 1952 in Chicago. He served as a State Representative for 24 years (1979-2002). He was a fiscal conservative. He started writing a political newsletter, called Buffett's Bullets, to educate and to provide insight into the inner workings of politics in NM from 1989 through 2008 and had a mailing list that grew from 150 to over 10,000 people from across the state. He also served as the Republican National Committeeman for the State of NM for four years (2004-2008) and he again attended the Republican National Convention 2008 in Minneapolis. George founded B&H Company in 1952, which ran concessions at various fiestas and fairs across the state. This business also ran the concessions at the ABQ Zoo for 16 years, the concessions at Speedway Park, the concessions at the Civic Auditorium and the concessions at the ABQ Dukes for 18 years. This business grew into B&H Wholesale, which supplies other concessionaires, their products and currently distributes across the state of NM and into parts of AZ, CO, OK, TX and UT. In 1956, George founded Buffett's Candies. George founded also the Popcorn Cannery, which produces and distributes pre-popped and flavored popcorn to grocery stores in ABQ. Legislative financial disclosure forms have listed George's ownership of unspecified shares in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway."

She married successively Steve Shane, Mike Moss and Jack Greenberg, and is the mother of Jill Levin and Brad Moss, all five being successful bridge players. Greenberg has participated in every thrice-annual North American Bridge Championships meet since 1966 and has won 17 NABC-rated events (sometimes called \"national championships\" in the US). She has won five world championships as a member of USA women teams including four from 1976 to 1984. In four of these wins she partnered Jacqui Mitchell. Greenberg was inducted by the ACBL Hall of Fame in 2013 as a recipient of the von Zedtwitz Award. In 1983, she took part in a televised match between teams representing the US and Britain, arranged by the BBC. The match was featured in a book that described her thus:Gail Moss... sometimes strays from orthodox... Gail Moss is decidedly lively in her defensive play, always looking for the chance to attack, but there is the impression... that Jackie Mitchell [sic] has tempered her partner's exuberance with some sharp reproofs."

Khatri joined the Government of India in 1966, after his graduation, and, over the years, rose in rank to head the nationwide tuberculosis programme. During his tenure, he managed what is rated by many as the largest Directly Observed Short Course (DOTS) TB and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment in history which started with 18 million patients in 1998 and covered 500 million patients at the time of his retirement from service in 2002. During this period, it is reported that the death rate due to the disease was brought down to 5 per cent. After his retirement, Khatri joined World Lung Foundation as a technical advisor on lung health and also works as a member of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Panel on Tuberculosis. He also participates in workshops and seminars to deliver keynote addresses as a global consultant. Gulshan Rai Khatri was honoured by the Government of India with the civilian award of Padma Shri, in 2013."

  "text" : "Gertrude Guillaume-Schack (9 November 1845 – 20 May 1903) was a German-born women's rights activist who pioneered the fight against state-regulated prostitution in Germany. She met considerable resistance due to the prevailing belief that such matters should not be discussed by respectable people, especially women. She also became active in organizing German women's workers associations, and was linked to the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Her activities and political views caused her to be exiled by the German authorities. She moved to England in 1886, where she became involved in Socialist organizations but fell out with Friedrich Engels. After leaving the English Socialist League she became involved in theosophy, and her resulting refusal to accept medical treatment may have contributed to her early death of untreated breast cancer."

After early commercial success designing for other brands, McCann established his own label in 1963. He attracted the attention of influential US fashion buyers in the mid 1960s and soon began designing for the American market, as well as for key British fashion retailers targeting the youth market. He moved to the US to work on New York's Seventh Avenue in 1974, returning to Britain some two decades later, where he continued supplying UK fashion retailers. In a profile piece in The Times in 1991, Liz Smith described him as: \"a master of high style at low prices\". The Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) described him as playing: \"an influential role in the development of the UK fashion industry\"."

Clarke was a student of Ronald Grimshaw and attended the Royal College of Art in 1948 after serving in the RAF. He received the silver medal at the Milan Triennale for a collaboration with the furniture designer, Robin Day. He was part of a group of artists including Lynn Chadwick, Reg Butler and Kenneth Armitage who in 1952 was exhibited in the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. They were described by art critic Herbert Read as \"the geometry of fear sculptors\". He was commissioned to create the cross of nails for Coventry Cathedral and also worked on three of the nave windows between 1957 and 1962. In 1965 he had a retrospective at The Redfern Gallery, London and his work is also held at the Tate Gallery. Clarke was made a Royal Academician in 1975."

  "text" : "G. Pat Collins, also known as George Pat Collins or Pat Collins (December 16, 1895 – August 5, 1959) was an American actor of the stage and screen. After serving in US military during World War I, Collins began his acting career in the New York theater scene. His first Broadway appearance was in the 1922 play, The Bootleggers, a short-lived comedy which was produced at the 39th Street Theatre in November and December of that year. He would appear in ten plays between 1922 and 1938. His film career would last slightly longer, mostly as a character actor or in smaller roles, from 1928 through 1958, during which time he appeared in over 100 films. Collins often played earnest roles like police or military officers. His first film was a silent picture, the 1928 film, The Racket, which stars Louis Wolheim, and in which Collins had a featured role. It would be the only silent film he would make. Two years later, in 1930, Collins would have a featured role in another film with Wolheim, the classic All Quiet on the Western Front. In 1922 he would marry the silent film actress, Billie Rhodes, and the two would remain married until Collins death. After finishing work on They Died With Their Boots On, in which he had a small role, Collins took a break from the film industry, and at the age of 47 re-enlisted in the armed services for the duration of World War II. He would return to films with a small role in 1947's Easy Come, Easy Go. Collins would continue to act in films through 1958, mostly in supporting and small roles. His final film would be in the Glenn Ford 1958 vehicle, The Sheepman. He died on August 5, 1959 in Los Angeles, aged 63."

  "text" : "Ira won the 2013 Sports Car Club of America E Production National Championship road race in his #2 Revtech 1971 Datsun 240Z. The race at Road America at Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin was the 50th anniversary of the SCCA's annual \"Runoffs.\" E Production is the fastest of the production car-based club racing classes. In the years preceding Ira's championship, he placed 2nd in 2010, 2011, and 2012, and he set several track records with the same car. He was awarded SCCA's Kimberly Cup in 2008. Choosing not to defend his title in 2014, Ira instead assisted his younger brother Cliff in winning the 2014 SCCA Super Touring Light National Championship at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterrey, California in an Acura Integra GSR. Ira started out the 2015 season at Round One of the SCCA's Southeast Conference US Majors Tour at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Florida with a new track record in Race 1, but a DNF due to mechanical failure. However, he repaired his 240Z and came back to claim a solid victory in Race 2. The Majors Tour round at Sebring International Raceway saw Ira claim 1st place finishes in both races. On September 27, 2015, Ira won his second (and Nissan's 98th) SCCA National Championship, in his EP2 Revtech/Ztrix.com 240Z, at Daytona International Speedway."

He obtained top twenty finishes on his respective category in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), and has also been training throughout most of his sailing career for Imperial Yacht Club in Cape Town, under his Irish-born personal coach Trevor Millar. Blanckenberg made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the Laser class. Sailing through the eleven-race series, he scored a career best result in the fifth heat with a momentous lead over a vast fleet of forty-three sailors, but dropped shortly to ninth in the medal round with a net score of 92. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Blanckenberg qualified for his second South African team, as a 24-year-old lone sailor, in the Laser class by placing eighth and obtaining a berth from the 2003 ISAF World Championships in Cadiz, Spain. Unlike his previous Olympics, Blanckenberg could not compensate from an early surge in the opening to climb again on top of the rankings, as he finished seventeenth out of forty-two sailors in the official fleet with a net score of 156."

  "text" : "Gregory Amenoff (born 1948) is an American painter. He is located in the tradition of the early American Modernist painters Georgia O'Keeffe, Charles Burchfield, Milton Avery, Arthur Dove and Marsden Hartley.

In the 1990s Amenoff had three traveling solo exhibitions. A retrospective of works on paper originating at the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts, titled Gregory Amenoff, Works on Paper 1975–1992 traveled to Massachusetts, Tampa Museum of Art, Tampa, Florida, Norton Gallery of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida, Wellington Gray Gallery, and East Carolina University, in Greenville, North Carolina.

From 1986 to 1993 Amenoff showed with Hirschl & Adler Modern on Madison Avenue. He showed at Salander O'Reilly on East 79th Street from 1998 to 2004. He is currently represented by the Alexandre Gallery on 57th Street. He has had several one-person exhibitions at the Stephen Wirtz Gallery in San Francisco, California, James Corcoran Gallery in Los Angeles, California, Gerald Peters Gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Texas Gallery in Houston, Texas.

The possibility has been raised that Actius may be the freedman (libertus) of Ummidia Quadratilla who is discussed in the letters of Pliny the Younger. Various graffiti found at Pompeii record praise for Actius. These include: \n* \"Actius, master of stage performers.\" from tomb 4 in the Fondo Pacifico near the amphitheater of Pompeii \n* \"Actius, greetings.\" from the large theater at Pompeii \n* a possible mention of Actius from Herculaneum: \"Lucius Actius, hail.

Born on 1st of February 1919, Gwen Paxton won a scholarship to Roedean School and went on to study French and German at Girton College, Cambridge. During her studies, she spent a year at the University of Freiburg to improve her German. At Cambridge, she earned blues in lacrosse and lawn tennis. In an interview in 2011, she stated: \"Before the war I had lived in Germany for a year studying at Freiburg as part of my degree and I made a lot of friends. A lot of the Germans I knew were charming, so it was difficult to think of them as the enemy.\" Upon graduation she was recruited to work as a civilian translator at Hut 4, Bletchley Park, translating decrypted German naval communications into English. She worked there for four years, while billeted with a family in Woburn Sands. After the war, she worked for a publishing company as a literary assistant. She married Barrie Hollington (died 1964) with whom she had five children. She died on 12th of June 2014."

He also compiled Psalms and Hymns for the Use of the Baptist Denomination in conjunction with Baptist denominational leaders. His hymn collections include Hymns, Verses, and Chants and Songs of Spiritual Thought, published by the Religious Tract Society in 1885. He wrote or reworded a large number of hymns, including 'With Gladness we Worship'. A review of Songs of Spiritual Thought published in The Congregationalist stated: \"There are few who have contributed hymns of such exquisite beauty and such rare sweetness as are to be found in this collection.\" Following his death in 1889 he was buried in Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol."

  "text" : "Giovanni Battista Traverso was an important mycologist and plant pathologist on the early 1900s. He was born in Pavia, Italy on October 25, 1878 and died on January 22, 1955 (Baldacci, 1959). He was interested in the flora since his early years what could be seen on his prints that he gave to the catalog of the vascular plants of Pavia in 1898 (Flora urbica pavese) (Traverso, 1898; Stafleu, and Cowan, 1986). Traverso completed his major in natural sciences at University of Pavia in July 1900. By that time he was also professor of botany and director of the Italian Cryptogamic Laboratory. His first advisor was Giovanni Briosi, who created a peaceful atmosphere of work at the University of Pavia where Traverso had the opportunity to publish his works with botany and mycology (Baldacci, 1959). After his graduation he worked at the Agricultural Experimental Station in Modena, Italy, for a short period of time and moved to Padua, Italy, to work with Pier Andrea Saccardo who was a botany professor (Baldacci, 1959). At that time they published some works together: Contributions to the mycology of Sardinia (“Contribuzione all flora micologica della Sardegna”) in 1903, and Arrangement and nomenclature of mycological groups in the ‘cryptogamic Italian flora’ (“Sulla disposizione e nomenclatura dei gruppi micologici da seguirsi nelle ‘Flora italica crytogama’”) in 1907. In 1905 he obtained a degree of general botanist and worked until 1914 as Saccardo’s assistant at the University of Padua, where he started working with mycology and formed the Italian mycological school (Baldacci, 1959). Most of his published works are from these years. In 1915 he got a job of vice-director at the Station of Plant Pathology in Rome, Italy. At the Station he had a chance to meet a great professor advisor, Giuseppe Cuboni, who was dedicated to the research new pathways of plant diseases (Baldacci, 1959). The greatest of his works on plant pathology are dated from this period, which includes the studies on downy mildew of wheat (Sclerophthora macrospora), “ink disease” on chestnut trees caused by Phytophthora sp., certain bacterial diseases, as well as significant works of mycology (Baldacci, 1959), including 77 described species, and published works on the mycological classe of Sordariomycetes (or Pyrenomycetes), and on the families Xylariaceae, Valsaceae, and Ceratostomataceae. Traverso, succeeding Luigi Meomartini, became a plant pathology professor at the Institute of Agriculture (“R. Istituto superiore di Agricoltura”) in Milan, Italy, by November 1923; nowadays, this school is named the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences of Milan (“Facoltà di Scienze Agrarie”), the largest school of agriculture in Italy. He taught for 25 years and left the chair in 1948 (replaced by Elio Baldacci), but continued working as a Dean of the Faculty and then as a professor emeritus, spending the rest of his life in Milan (Baldacci, 1959). Between these years he identified 3 more species of fungi Aspergillus kitaii, Flammula carbonaria var. spegazziniana, and Oidium cyanescens, and conserved a herbarium with a mycological collection of more than 1500 species. His works started the Cyptogamic Italian Flora, a series of books which describes and diagnoses fungi. Traverso compiled the first four books of the series, dedicating the first book to the Italian Bibliography of Mycology and the subsequent to the group of the Sordariomycetes (or Pyrenomycetes), of which he was one of the leading specialists from around the world. He became a follower on Saccardo’s works publishing the volumes XIX and XX of the Sylloge Fungorum, an enormous and unique work published that was reprinted in USA in the 60's. In the same book, he had also collaboration on the volumes XVII, XXIII and XXIV (Baldacci, 1959). Showing his devotion, Traverso published on the new Italian botanic journal the commemorative papers of Saccardo and Cuboni, tracing their biography (Traverso, 1920). When Traverso died Giacomo Bresadola, a mycologist from Trent, was the one who took care of the funeral and the posthumous publication of Traverso's works with Basidiomycetes (Baldacci, 1959). Elio Baldacci was Traverso's successor, working as a professor at the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences of Milan (Belli at al., 2007). Traverso was a great Italian who honored the country in the sciences and in particular in the field of mycology and plant pathology (Baldacci, 1959), his works were well recognized and are still used on the present days."

  "text" : "Girolamo Cavalcabo (known in France as 'Hieronyme' or 'Hieronymus') was a Bolognese fencing master, teaching in Rome and later Paris in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Egerton Castle suggests that his father was Zacharia Cavalcabo, who published Angelo Viggiani’s treatise in 1567; indeed, Castle believes that Viggiani was Hieronyme’s fencing master. At some point, Girolamo traveled to Rome, where he perhaps first came into contact by the ‘Agrippan’ system of guards; Brantôme in his memoirs mentions a \"Hiéronime\" teaching in Rome. In 1597, Seigneur de Villamont translated Cavalcabo’s manuscript 'Treaty or Instruction for Fencing' into French. Possibly because of this, Cavalcabo was appointed to the court of Henry IV of France to teach the Dauphin (later Louis XIII) and his brother Gaston D’Orleans; his son, César, was Master of Arms to the French Court until 1642."

  "text" : "George Philip Ottey (9 October 1824 – 17 December 1891) was an English clergyman and educationalist and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University from 1844 to 1847. He was born at Southfleet in Kent and died at Bournemouth, then in Hampshire, now in Dorset. Ottey was educated at Rugby School and at St John's College, Cambridge. In cricket he had success as a bowler and his batting figures are not impressive by modern standards; in a few matches, however, he opened the batting. It is not known if he batted or bowled right- or left-handed. He played in several of Cambridge University's first-class games in the 1844, 1845 and 1846 seasons, appearing in the University Match against Oxford University each year, and reappeared in 1847 for a fourth University Match, though that was his only game of that season. He twice took six wickets in an innings, though the full scorecards for most of his games are not available. In his final University Match of 1847, his last game of first-class cricket, he shared all 20 Oxford wickets with John Lee, each taking 10 in the match. Ottey graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1847 and was ordained as a Church of England priest. He served as curate in parishes in Worcester, Lewisham and Whitechapel, and from 1871 to 1886 he was the inspector of schools for the Diocese of London and, from 1876, prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral; from 1886 until he retired in 1889 he was rector of Much Hadham in Hertfordshire. Ottey was an author. His books included an 1867 volume called The Dragon Bound and Loosed which debates whether the Millennium might have begun between A.D. 789 and 867, and would therefore end no later than 1867. Later works included scripted lessons for Sunday School teachers."

He received his education in the public schools of Eau Claire and at the University of Wisconsin, graduating with a law degree in 1893. Blum was admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin the same year. In February 1895, he formed a partnership in Eau Claire with John B. Fleming under the firm name of Fleming & Blum, with that arrangement continuing until January 1, 1908. In April 1901, Blum was elected Eau Claire County Judge and served in that capacity for 38 years. A special act of the Wisconsin State Legislature in 1927 greatly increased his powers and jurisdiction. Blum was heavily involved in the business community of the Chippewa Valley. In 1919, Judge Blum bought the Laycock and Drummond blocks of Eau Claire, Wisconsin for over $80,000 dollars. This was one of the largest real estate transfer deals in the history of the city. Blum was one of the founders of the Walter Brewing Company and Consumers Tire & Tube Company. Blum also served as director of the Union National Bank and of the Union Mortgage Loan Company until January 1, 1934. Judge Blum married Margaret D. McGillis and had two daughters and one son; Margaret, Genevieve, and George L., Jr. Blum died of heart disease in 1939."

The Analects (14.36) records that Gongbo Liao spoke ill of Zilu to Ji Kangzi, the head of the powerful Jisun family that dominated the politics of Lu at the time. Zilu was one of Confucius' closest disciples, who served as an officer in the house of Jisun. Zifu Jingbo (子服景伯), an official of Lu, reported it to Confucius, saying that Ji Kangzi was misled by Gongbo Liao's accusation. Confucius responded that whatever Gongbo Liao said, he had no power to change fate. Han dynasty historian Sima Qian included Gongbo Liao in the \"Biographies of the Disciples of Confucius\" chapter of his Records of the Grand Historian, but many commentators consider Gongbo Liao unworthy of being considered a disciple of Confucius."

  "text" : "Gurban Mammadov (Azerbaijani: Qurban Məmmədov) (born April 2, 1959) is an Azerbaijani Politician. He was born in the village of Jahri (Azerb.: Cəhri) of Babek (Azerb.: Babək) district of Nakhchivan (Azerb.: Azərbaycan) Autonomous Republic. He went to school in Ordubad. In 1987, he graduated from Azerbaijan State University. He got involved with politics during university years. After graduation, he worked as a Lawyer for 25 years and heavily influenced Azerbaijani politics. He is very well known for being outspoken politician and never being afraid of government. Mr Mammadov also one of the famous people in Azerbaijan, who helped forming the political movement back in 1980's to 1990's, was a very close friend & supporter of first legal / elected president of Azerbaijan - Abulfaz Elchibey. Mr Mammadov also helped him during his Presidency and provided the necessary support required to form the constitution and legal system of Azerbaijan. A well-known lawyer in Azerbaijan, Mammadov dealt with human rights cases as the head of Chalkhan LLC, and as an independent attorney. As of early 2013, Mammadov began to seriously criticize the ruling regime and its policies, and became a member of the National Council, a coalition of opposition parties and civil society organizations, formed ahead of the October 2013 presidential election. Mammadov was accused of causing an automobile accident in 2012 that resulted in an injury to a parking lot guard. Mammadov was sentenced to a pre-trial detention without sufficient cause. In the third month of his detention, another charge was brought against him. On 6 December 2013, Nasimi District Court sentenced Mammadov to three years in prison. Although all testimonies and evidence including the evidence collected by investigation officers proved Mammadov’s innocence, the court ruling was solely based on the testimony of former police officer, Isa Mansurov, one of the case witnesses. Mansurov claimed that Mammadov’s car had run over the guard’s foot. But when questioned by the lawyers and Mammadov about the accident, he gave answers such as “I don’t remember.” The court refused to look at the footage recorded by surveillance camera No. TS3-098, which was three or four meters away from the scene of the accident. The court also refused to investigate other circumstances that could have impacted the case. Although none of the articles Mammadov was charged with carry three-year prison sentences, the court granted the public prosecutor’s request for this duration. It is not the first politically motivated arrest of Mr Gurban Mammadov. Previously, he was arrested in 1998 and charged with allegations that he plotted assassination of the president Haydar Aliyev, was sentenced for 5 years in prison. Azerbaijan's president approves amnesty for 87 prisoners on 29 December 2014 and Mr Gurban Mammadov is among them. Mr Mammadov was released from prison on 30 December 2014."

  "text" : "Giovanni di Francesco or Giovanni di Francesco del Cervelliera (1412 or 1428 – 1458) was an Italian painter, active in Florence in the mid-fifteenth century. He is principally associated with a group of paintings from the 1450s closely related to each other in style, exemplified by the Carrand Triptych that was formerly in the Carrand collection and is now in the Bargello museum in Florence. The creator of these paintings, previously known only as the work of the Master of the Carrand Triptych, was identified as Giovanni di Francesco by the art scholar Pietro Toesca in 1917 based on a payment record for one of the works."

He holds a PhD in Tibetan Literature (SOAS) and an MA in Sanskrit with Oriental Studies Studies (Edinburgh). In the 1970s he spent a decade living in Tibetan communities in India and Nepal where he received extensive teachings from Kangyur Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche, Chatral Rinpoche, and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. In 1971 Dudjom Rinpoche encouraged him to begin translating his recently completed History of the Nyigma School རྙིང་མའི་སྟན་པའི་རནམ་ཞག} and in 1980 his Fundamentals of the Nyingma School བསྟན་པའི་རྣམ་གཞག - together this was an undertaking that was to take twenty years, only reaching completion in 1991. In the 1980s Gyurme returned to the UK and in 1987 completed his 3 volume doctoral dissertation on the Guhyagarbhatantra and Lonchenpa's commentary on this text at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at the University of London. From 1991 to 1996 Gyurme held research fellowships at London University, where he worked with Alak Zenkar Rinpoche on translating (with corrections) the content of the Great Sanskrit Tibetan Chinese Dictionary to create the three volume Encyclopaedic Tibetan-English Dictionary. He has written, edited, translated and contributed to numerous important books on Tibetan religion and culture including The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History (2 vol.) (Wisdom, 1991), Tibetan Medical Paintings 2 vol. (Serindia, 1992), The Tibet Handbook (Footprint, 1996), the first complete translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and A Handbook of Tibetan Culture (Shambhala, 1994)."

  "text" : "Gregory \"Greg\" C. Avioli is an American business executive and lawyer best known for his work in the U.S. online gaming and horse racing industries. He started his career as a lawyer, before joining the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) in 1998. He held a number of roles in the organization, including general counsel, deputy commissioner, chief operating officer, and interim CEO, with primary responsibility for all government and regulatory affairs. From 1998 to 2000, the NTRA was the lead advocate for legislation to allow the US horse racing industry the exclusive right to conduct interstate online account wagering and commingling of betting pools. In support of this legislation Avioli authored the first comprehensive legal analysis on the legality of online wagering on US horseracing. This legislation was signed into law on December 15, 2000 by President Bill Clinton. In 2006 Avioli and the NTRA lobbying team secured an additional exemption for horseracing in the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which was signed into law by President Bush on October 13, 2006. In 2007, Avioli was hired as President and CEO of Breeder's Cup, Ltd. Over the next four years he oversaw the expansion of their World Championship with a doubling of the Championships' purses to $25 million and an emphasis on international wagering and online wagering. In 2008 Sports Business Daily named him one of six \"people to watch in the horse racing industry.\" In 2010, the Breeders' Cup revenues and profits were the highest in the organization's history. In 2011 he became the first CEO and president of Stronach Group, where he oversaw the privatization of \"MI Developments's racing properties following the bankruptcy proceedings of [Frank Stronach's] Magna Entertainment.\" He subsequently served as Managing Director of Teneo Strategy in New York City advising clients in the gaming, entertainment, and sports industries. Avioli currently is Executive Vice President of Game Play Network in Los Angeles, a global technology and gaming company that owns brands such as Oddz and bspot, which provide real money wagering capabilities in online and mobile games."

In 1927, she would play the wife of Uncle Tom in Uncle Tom's Cabin. She appeared mostly in minor or supporting roles, such as Queenie in the original version of Show Boat (1929), and Martha in Christy Cabanne's Conspiracy. Her appearance as Beulah Thorndyke in I'm No Angel (1933), led to her being forever linked to Mae West with the famous line, \"Beulah, peel me a grape\". In Howard's short career she would appear in twenty-two films. That career was cut short by her untimely death in 1934 at the age of 41. Mae West helped raise funds for her funeral."

  "text" : "Guillaume de Rochefort (c.1433 [or 1439] – 12 August 1492) was a lawyer who served as Lord Chancellor of France, under the French kings Louis XI and Charles VIII. Guillaume is thought to have been born at Pluvault or Rochefort-sur-Nenon (Jura), and was the son of Jacques II and his wife Agnès de Cléron. He was also the elder brother of Guy de Rochefort, another Chancellor of France. He began his career in the service of the dukes of Burgundy Philip the Good and Charles the Bold, first as a counsellor and later as chamberlain of Burgundy. Guillaume's first wife was Guye de Vurry ou Wourey, dame de Fouchereau; she gave birth to four children, and died in 1487. After her death, Guillaume married Anne de la Trémoille. In January 1484, Rochefort made a statement to the Estates-General, to the effect that King Richard III of England had murdered his nephew, King Edward V of England, and taken the crown for himself. It is assumed that he obtained this information from Dominic Mancini, who is thought to have been in personal contact with him the previous month."

Over his ten-year career, he appeared in over 125 shorts, many of which for Hal Roach, including several with Stanley Laurel and in the iconic Our Gang series. His Roach Studio contract was terminated in 1925- he subsequently toured the west coast in Vaudeville for a time- but Rowe's film career ended with the advent of talking pictures, with the reason he left the film industry unknown. He died on February 5, 1975 in Santa Barbara, California."

  "text" : "Gladys Blake (born January 12, 1910, Luray, Virginia – died May 21, 1983, Sacramento, California) was an American character actress from the 1930s to the 1950s. Her mother, Ada Timmons, died when Gladys was less than a year old. At fourteen, she would enter the theater world in a stock company, before moving on to vaudeville. In vaudeville, she met her husband, Lee Gresham, and the two formed an act together. While performing in Los Angeles, they were noticed by producer Edward Small, which led to her beginning in the film industry. Blake would make her film debut in a small role in I Have Lived (1933), directed by Richard Thorpe. She would have her first featured role later that same year in Rainbow over Broadway, which Thorpe also directed. Over her 20-year career, she would appear in over 100 films. She was noted for playing very talkative supporting roles. Appearing mostly in supporting or bit parts, she would occasionally be given a featured role, as in Lucky Night (1939), which starred Myrna Loy and Robert Taylor; or Woman of the Year (1942), which starred Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, in which she played Flo Peters, the wife of a friend of Tracy's character. Even more rarely she would be given the lead in a film, such as in Racing Blood (1936). In the early 1940s, she played the recurring role of \"Maisie\" in several of the Dr. Kildare films starring Lew Ayres, Lionel Barrymore, and Laraine Day. Other notable films in which she appeared include: Ship Ahoy (1942), starring Eleanor Powell and Red Skelton; the Abbott and Costello film, Who Done It?; the 1943 version of Phantom of the Opera, starring Claude Raines; The Naughty Nineties, again with Abbott and Costello; On the Town; The Yellow Cab Man, starring Red Skelton; and the 1952 epic, The Greatest Show on Earth. Blake's final role would be in 1952's This Woman is Dangerous, starring Joan Crawford and Dennis Morgan, in which she plays a garrulous hairdresser. Blake would die on May 21, 1983, in Sacramento, California."

  "text" : "Genaro Saavedra (born 1895) was a Filipino track and field athlete and four-time Far Eastern Championship Games champion. While at high school in Ambos Camarines, Saavedra was trained by a Nebraskan sports coach, Clinton \"Doc\" Fehliman, who taught for six years in the country during its era of American influence. Although primarily interested in American football, Fehliman trained Saavedra in a variety track and field sports as an all-round athlete. This training paid off on Saavedra's major international debut at the 1915 Far Eastern Championship Games held in Shanghai – the second edition of Asia's first major multi-sport event. Saavedra proved to be the star athlete for the Philippines at the competition: he won the 100-yard dash, pole vault, high jump and the decathlon. He also took a bronze medal in the long jump. This helped lead the Philippines to its second straight athletics championship title. Fehliman deemed Saavedra the \"Jim Thorpe of the Orient\", given his success across disciplines. Saavedra returned to represent his country at the 1917 Far Eastern Championship Games in Tokyo. He was less successful at this competition, but still came away with multiple medals in the form of a long jump silver (behind fellow Filipino C. Cardenas) and a bronze in the decathlon. The Philippines team won a third title, helped by Fortunato Catalon's sprint double, although the nation was equal on gold medals with the hosts on this occasion. His last major appearance was the 1919 Manila Games, where he was the long jump bronze medallist. Saavedra's four titles in Far Eastern competitions ranked him as one of the tournament's most successful track athletes: only Catalon, Mikio Oda and Regino Ylanan won as many individual golds in the competition's history. Saavedra was the only person to have won Far Eastern Championship Games gold medals in four separate disciplines."

  "text" : "Gabriele Possanner (1860–1940) was the first female doctor to practice medicine in Austria. She was the daughter of the Austrian jurist Benjamin Possanner, and lived in six different cities until the age of twenty due to him moving often for his work. In October 1880 he was appointed as Section Chief at the Imperial Treasury in Vienna, and the family, including Gabriele, was able to settle in Vienna. As a doctor Gabriele initially worked as a public medical officer in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Muslim women refused to be seen by male doctors. She had been given a medical degree by the University of Zurich in 1894, but it was not until 1897 that she was able to take the viva voce examination a second time, this time in front of Viennese examiners, thus qualifying her to practice as a doctor in Austria. She thus became the first woman to graduate from the University of Vienna with a medical degree in 1897. After that she was the only female doctor at an Austrian-Hungarian hospital until 1903."

In November 2012, he left Alleanza per l'Italia and joined again the parliamentary group Italy of Values, of which he became National Manager for the Green Economy. In 2012, after a campaign based on his book Il transumanesimo. Una nuova filosofia per l'uomo del XXI secolo (Transhumanism. A new philosophy for the man of the 21st century), he was described as 'the world's first transhumanist politician', however, a controversial parliamentary question he submitted about UFOs, and rooted in an apocryphal story, created a social media quarreland eventually led the Italian transhumanist association to explicitly disassociate his activity from the transhumanist movement."

He was born at Clevedon, Somerset and died at Longniddry, East Lothian, Scotland. Educated at Uppingham School, Jupp played most of his cricket in Scotland where he was a civil servant in the Office of Works. He was a right-handed lower order batsman and a bowler of unknown type; in five games for his native Somerset, his highest score was just 23 and he bowled only three overs, conceding a single run but taking no wickets. His record in Scottish minor cricket was much more substantial, however, and at his death in 1938 he was termed \"a dominating personality in Scottish cricket\" and \"for many years an automatic choice in representative matches\". First-class matches played by Scotland were very limited in Jupp's heyday, but against the 1912 Australian side he scored 27 and 56, his two highest first-class scores, in what would prove to be his final first-class game."

  "text" : "George Sydney Raynor (9 October 1852 – 1 September 1887) was an English clergyman, a schoolmaster and a cricketer who played in first-class cricket matches for Cambridge University in 1872 and 1873. He was born at Sandsend, Lythe, North Yorkshire and died at West Wickham, Kent. Raynor was educated at Brentwood Grammar School, from where he won a scholarship to Winchester College, and at St John's College, Cambridge. At Winchester, he was a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler, but at Cambridge he batted very low in the batting order. The 37 not out that he made in the match against Surrey in 1872 constituted more than half of his total first-class runs and was made from No 11 in the batting line-up. In the previous match, he had taken five wickets in the second innings of the Gentlemen of England game for 44 runs, and this was the best bowling performance of his first-class career. He was picked for the 1872 University Match against Oxford University, but was not successful, failing to take a wicket. In 1873, he played only a single match, again with little success, and was not selected again. Raynor graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1875 and took up a post as an assistant master at Repton School; he was ordained as a Church of England priest in 1877. From 1881 to 1886 he was headmaster of Kensington Foundation School and for the last year of his life was headmaster of the Royal Naval Academy at Gosport."

Robinson is a North Carolina Republican politician who served in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1980–86 and 1988-96 and was selected by Caldwell County party leaders in 2015 to return to the legislature to fill an unexpired term. Through the end of 2016, Robinson will fill the 87th District seat vacated by Edgar Starnes, who resigned to accept a position with the North Carolina State Treasurer's office. Robinson ran for a new full term but was defeated by Destin Hall in the March 15, 2016 Republican primary. Robinson, a native of Lenoir, North Carolina, is a veteran of the United States Air Force and an alumnus of the University of Tennessee. After Robinson served his first three terms, he gave up his seat to run for the United States House of Representatives, but was defeated by Cass Ballenger in a Republican primary election. Robinson then served as deputy assistant secretary of the North Carolina Department of Transportation under Governor James G. Martin. He returned to the legislature in the 1988 election and was re-elected in 1990, 1992 and 1994. Concerns about his family’s timber company’s financial situation made him decide not to run for re-election in 1996. In 1997, he became mayor of the village of Cedar Rock, North Carolina. Robinson was also an unsuccessful candidate for the North Carolina Senate in 2004 (losing to Jim Jacumin in a Republican primary election) and in 2012 (losing to Dan Soucek in a Republican primary election)."

She found her flair for fashion design at an early age when she would make clothes for her dolls that matched the latest trends and styles. She later developed that flair when, while attending USC, she worked as a floor model and sales associate at a large department store in Los Angeles in the mid-1930s. After graduating from college, she began working at Bullock's Willshire as a floor model. The names were purely coincidental, as she had no relation to the store-owners. After that she was hired by a milliner, or a hat designer for women, and then an established fashion designer. Realizing this was something she wanted to pursue even further, Georgia then studied at Frank Wiggins Trade School in Los Angeles. All of her work in stores and with customers helped prepare her for her career in fashion."
