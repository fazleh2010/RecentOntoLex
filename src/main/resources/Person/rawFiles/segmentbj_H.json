  "text" : "Hemendra Prasad Barooah was born on the 1st of April at Jalukonibari, near Jorhat, of the Northeast Indian state of Assam,to Shiva Prasad Barooah and Kamal Kumari Barooah, in 1926. He came from Khongiya Barooah family, a rich Assamese family that was already in tea plantation business established by Bisturam Barooah, a rich planter who started his business during a period when the Britishers were controlling the tea industry in Assam. His father died when Hemen was in his youth and after securing an MBA from the Harvard University, reportedly the first person from the Northeast India to secure a Harvard MBA, Hemendra started out in 1949, with the three tea gardens he inherited from his mother. He nurtured his business after releasing it from the control of the Williamson Magor group, which controlled tea business during those times. At the time of his death, Hemndra Barooah controlled nine garden, held under his Kolkata-based business firm, Barooahs and Associates Pvt. Ltd. Hemen Barooah was known for his efforts to counter the threats of United Liberation Front of Assam, an Assam separatist group banned as a terrorist outfit by the Government of India, which, at times, resorted to violent attacks. He was a known art collector reportedly owning 600 works and has also produced a film, Ek Pal, directed by Kalpana Lajmi. His life story has been written by Wasbir Hussain, a noted journalist and published under the name, Life And Times - Story Of An Assamese Tea Baron. On 26 January 2013, the Government of India announced the award of Padma Shri to Hemendra Prasad Barooah, honouring him for his services to the Trade and Industry of India. Six months later, on 31 July 2013, Barooah, aged 86, breathed his last at Bangkok, while on a trip to the Thailand capital for medical treatment. His wife and only son, Amit Borooah, having preceded him, he was survived by his two daughters and their families. It was reported that Barooah had already built his mausoleum earlier, in 2004, decked with a green marble with only the date of death left to be filled. Assam Tea Brokers, the first tea broking firm in Assam, founded by Hemen Barooah, remains as his legacy. He is credited with efforts to bring tea tourism to Assam, by opening his ancestral home, Thengal Manor, and two other colonial buildings to tourists and by founding the Heritage North East, a Boutique heritage hotel and the Kaziranga Golf Resorts, Sangsua. The ITA Centre, at Machkhowa, reportedly built by him, is also another contribution credited to him. Hemen Barooah has established a charity foundation, Kamal Kumari Barooah Foundation, and the foundation gives annual awards to recognize excellence in the fields of science and technology (Kamal Kumari Barooah award), journalism (Shiva Prasad Barooah award) and art (Amit Borooah Award)."

  "text" : "Hannah White Arnett (1733–1823) was an American woman who is known for preventing a group of men in Elizabethtown, New Jersey (now Elizabeth) from proclaiming their loyalty to Great Britain in exchange for “protection of life and property.”  When she heard the men, who were meeting in her house, talking about this offer, she called them cowards and traitors. Although Isaac, her husband, tried to get her out of the room, she continued to harangue the men and stated that she would leave her husband if he did not continue to support the American Revolution. The men eventually refused the offer. In 1876 this account of Hannah White Arnett was first told, in the New York Observer in a piece by Henrietta Holdich. On July 13, 1890, after the Sons of the American Revolution refused to allow women to join their group, Mary Smith Lockwood published the story of Hannah White Arnett in the Washington Post, ending her piece with the question, \"Where will the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution place Hannah Arnett?\"  On July 21 of that year, William O. McDowell, a great-grandson of Hannah White Arnett, published an article in the Washington Post offering to help form a society to be known as the Daughters of the American Revolution. The first meeting of the society was held August 9, 1890. A memorial “honoring the patriotic dead of many wars laid to rest in this hallowed ground especially a noble woman Hannah White Arnett” was erected in 1938 in the cemetery of the First Presbyterian Church, Elizabeth, New Jersey, by the Boudinot Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. This is the cemetery where Arnett was buried. Another marker on the wall of that cemetery, which is now illegible, read in part, “Near here rests Hannah White Arnett…Her patriotic words, uttered in the dark days of 1776, summoned discouraged men to keep Elizabethtown loyal to the cause of American independence.” The Hannah White Arnett Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution was named after her; it is a Fort Payne, Alabama chapter."

  "text" : "Horatio Davis Sheppard (c. 1809 - February 24, 1879) (sometimes spelled Horatio Shepard) was an American physician who in 1833 founded the first penny press newspaper in the United States, the New York Morning Post. In 1830, Sheppard was a medical student with no real experience in publishing, but he had witnessed the populace of New York City willing to buy anything that cost a penny. For over a year he approached printing offices to propose that a paper could be successfully sold at a penny price, but had no luck convincing anyone until meeting Francis Story. Story was a foreman at the Spirit of the Times and printer of other items, and wanted to start his own business. He agreed to go in with Sheppard if they also brought on Horace Greeley. Greeley, however, insisted that the paper must be marketed at two-cents, not one. Sheppard was forced to agree, even though this defied the entire scheme of the venture. So, with Greeley and Story, the two-cent Morning Post was first issued on January 1, 1833. But it did not prove a success. Its debt was quickly mounting and they had little capital to speak of. All agreed to finally drop the price to one-cent (for its final two issues—and it did sell better) but it was too late, and the paper folded the same month. Nevertheless, Sheppard has been credited for the concept of the penny press in America, which proved successful later the same year when Benjamin Day launched The Sun. After the adventure of the Morning Post ended, Sheppard left the newspaper business and went into medical practice, though he remained friends with Greeley until Greeley's death in 1872. Sheppard died from pneumonia at St. Luke's Hospital in New York on February 24, 1879."

Bell was appointed to the board of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) in 1919, and became the MMTB's second chairman in 1936, a position he held until 1949. Under Bell, the MMTB converted the remaining cable trams to electric trams or buses, increased the MMTB's usage of buses, and work towards modernising the tram system, while returning strong surpluses. Bell was primarily a supporter of electric trams advocating their advantages over buses. During his career he ran for a seat on the Victorian Legislative Council, and was occasionally accused of unethical behaviour."

  "text" : "Henry Cronjager was a pioneering cinematographer during the early days of silent film, right up through the beginning of the sound film era. Born in Germany on February 15, 1877, he and his brother, Jules, moved to the United States, where they eventually found work as cinematographers, working for companies such as Edison Studios, the Biograph Company, and Fox Film Corporation. He was known for his use of shadows, which would become a staple of the later German expressionist film movement. His two sons, Henry Cronjager Jr. and Edward Cronjager were also cinematographers, with Edward being nominated for seven Oscars. His grandson, William Cronjager (through Henry Jr.), was an Emmy Award-winning cinematographer. His memorable silent films include 1917's Crime and Punishment, Mary Pickford's 1919 hit, Daddy Long Legs, and the 1921 film, Tol'able David. His career went into decline with the advent of talking pictures, although he was one of several talented cameraman to film Howard Hughes' iconic 1930 film, Hell's Angels. In an ironic twist, when he was demoted from cinematographer to cameramen on the 1934 film Kentucky Kernels, he would retire. His son Edward had been selected as the director of photography for that film."

  "text" : "Haleem Khan is an Indian Kuchipudi dancer, performer and movie actor, born on 10 April from Ongole of Andhra Pradesh and presently lives in Hyderabad. Haleem has performed more than 800 dance shows across the world, as well conducted Kuchipudi workshops overseas. Haleem specializes in Rupanurupam (female impersonation) within Kuchipudi; he is well known for his performance of Bhama Kalapam  and various roles in Annamacharya kirtanas. Hailing from a Muslim family in a small town, Haleem had faced many difficulties in learning Kuchipudi without his family knowing of it. Initially Haleem had performed under the stage name of Hari. His dance, specially the female impersonation has given him a ciritical acclaim and won him many awards and felicitations. Haleem is very passionate about preserving the art and is working on an interactive Kuchipudi dance instruction video. Right from his childhood days, classical dance form of Kuchipudi fascinated him and movies were his primary source of inspiration. Long before he fully comprehended the obstacles that had to be faced, he had set his goals to pursue learning Kuchipudi. He was blessed to find his guru, Shri Kaza Venkata Subramanyam garu, who spotted divine grace in him and gave guidance to his passion. The Passion, innovation and excellence of dance is ingrained in him, Innovation can be seen in many of his performances where he intertwined poetry and music (both English and Urdu) with dance, fused ballet with Kuchipudi. He can effortlessly bring out the aggression of Lord Shiva as he does the Tandavam, or can take the audience inside a woman's heart who is romancing her man through his Javali. As he is a natural performing artist. He acted in films successfully, he has been passionate in looking at a broad canvas. To look inside the psyche of his artistic nature, and what drives him, is perhaps the innate desire to, in many ways preserve the ancient dance form, where dance cannot reach many due to the pressures of modern day life, constraints in access to resources; he produced a sophisticated Dance Instructional DVD. He has taken upon himself the shades and nuances to hold on to and propagate the ancient tradition when female dancers did not take to the stage, and female impersonation was popular; He is one among the few male dancers who can don the female role effortlessly leaving the audience mesmerized. The jigsaw puzzle fits -- his passion as a male dancer to preserve and propagate his centuries old dance form. Ambition has no end, and he has been blessed by many gurus and very senior artists and veterans, that he will go a long way. The sky is the only limit for a passionate dancer. He debuted in Telugu movies with Nuvvila which has performed well at the box office."

  "text" : "Hafsteinn Ægir Geirsson (born August 4, 1980 in Reykjavík) is a retired Icelandic sailor, who specialized in the Laser class. He represented his nation Iceland in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), and has also been training throughout most of his sporting career for Þytur Sailing Regatta (Icelandic: Siglingaklúbburinn Þytur). Geirsson made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he placed forty-second in the Laser class with a net grade of 355, after having decided to pull himself out in the last race due to yachting malfunction. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Geirsson qualified for his second Icelandic team, as a 24-year-old, in the Laser class by granting a tripartite invitation from the International Sailing Federation. Sailing through the race series with a similar effort from the previous Olympics, Geirsson recorded a satisfying grade of 344 net points to upgrade his position to fortieth in a fleet of forty-two sailors. Hafsteinn Geirsson is also a cyclist. He has won several competitions, i.e. Icelandic competitions and the Faroese Kring Føroyar (Tour of Faroe Islands) which he has won four times, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008."

  "text" : "Harvey Shield (born Harvey Schildkraut, September 6, 1946) is an English musician and songwriter. He was born in Twickenham and grew up in Wembley. He was a drummer in the Cadet Pipe Band at Harrow County School, where he met Roger Glover. They formed a beat group, the Madisons, in which Harvey played drums and sang. In 1965 the group became known as Episode Six with Ian Gillan as lead singer. While with Episode Six Harvey recorded six singles for Pye Records, appeared on Ready Steady Go!, and toured with Alan Price and Dusty Springfield. In 1966 Episode Six performed at the Casino du Liban in Beirut, Lebanon where he met Greek dancer and singer, Natasha Koumianou. In September, 1967 he left the band to pursue a career with her. Later, Roger and Ian left the band to join Deep Purple. Natasha and Harvey's cabaret career began in Paris where they recorded a single for Disques Vogue. They toured throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa until 1974 and performed aboard the ill-fated cruise ship, Achille Lauro. In 1975 Harvey moved to Los Angeles, California where he wrote and recorded the song The Way I Feel Tonight. He signed a recording contract with Atco Records who released the single under the name Shields in 1977. The song went on to become a worldwide hit for the Scottish group, The Bay City Rollers in 1978. In 1985 his musical Hamelin: A Musical Tale from Rats to Riches written with Richard Jarboe, was produced off-Broadway at the Circle in the Square Theatre in Greenwich Village, New York following initial productions at the Olio, Los Angeles and Musical Theater Works, New York. In 1986 he formed The Mighty Echoes, an a cappella Doo Wop quartet, which has recorded five albums and continues to perform. Author Jay Warner calls them \"the West Coast equivalent of the best East Coast a cappella groups of the last twenty years\". They have been seen on stage, film and television in shows such as Who's The Boss?, Murphy Brown, Family Matters, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. As a movie actor he serenaded Debra Winger in Wilder Napalm (1993), negotiated with Pamela Anderson in Barb Wire (1996), and played a coke-snorting Brit in Crazy Eyes (2012). In 2015 he was cast as famous rock drummer, Keith Edwards, in the Disney TV series I Didn't Do It."

His wealth was built on pastoral holdings and land deals and he exercised enormous influence over the colony's parliament. Glass was born in Portaferry, County Down, Ireland in 1817. In 1840 he migrated to Victoria and by 1845 he was established as a station agent and merchant. Glass speculated in buying and selling rural landholdings. In 1862 he was considered the richest man in Victoria, but his business empire collapsed in the late 1860s. Glass died on 15 May 1871 in Flemington, Victoria."

  "text" : "Henry Hoyle Oddie (31 January 1815 – 21 May 1869) was an English lawyer and landowner, and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University between 1834 and 1836. He was born and died at Colney House, St Albans, in Hertfordshire. Oddie was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He played as a batsman in seven first-class matches for the Cambridge side over three seasons; he batted in the middle and lower order, though not with any success in any position as his highest score was just 14 and he averaged just 5.57 with the bat. There is no record that he bowled in first-class cricket. In 1836, he played in the University match against Oxford University, scoring 9 and 3 and taking his only recorded catch. Oddie graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1837 and was admitted to the Middle Temple the same year. By 1861, married and with six children and a large staff of servants, he was a farmer at Worth, West Sussex, though he later moved to the family home in Hertfordshire."

Neither of these developments seemed as inevitable or obvious at the time as they later became with the benefit of hindsight: Hugo Hickmann was resolute in his opposition to both of them."

  "text" : "Harald Holz (born 14 May 1930, in Freiburg im Breisgau) is a German philosopher, logician, mathematician (autodidact), poet and novelist. The focal point of his work was and is the development of a philosophy of great sincerity. Holz further develops the transcendental philosophy, liberated it from the convergence of Neokantianism. Following his reevaluation and new interpretation of the German Idealism he developed a new transcendental basis of reflexion for it. During this endeavour, he critically discussed transcendental pragmatism, Neo-Empirism and the so-called Postmodernism. He taught at universities in Bochum/Germany, Münster/Germany, Washington D.C., Córdoba (Argentinia), Valparaíso (Chile)) and Buenos Aires. Holz published many books on epistemology, metaphysics, ontology, ethics and social philosophy, philosophy of culture, comparative philosophy, history and natural philosophy. Harald Holz belongs to the minority  of contemporary philosophers, who critically view fundamental positions of contemporary thought."

Dudkin was born in Newark, New Jersey on June 25, 1908. He graduated in 1929 from New Jersey Law School (now Rutgers School of Law–Newark). He was a member of the McClellan Law Club, a debating society, and won the Chester Sherman Prize for legal research. He was admitted to the New Jersey State Bar Association in 1931. He was also a 1951 graduate of the New Jersey Institute of Fire, Casualty and Life Underwriters. From 1941 to 1949, Dudkin sered as an Acting Judge of the Criminal Courts for the City of Newark. From 1949 to 1956, he served as the Secretary of the Newark Insurance Fund Commission. He later served as an Assistant Essex County Prosecutor. In 1948, Dudkin was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House of Representatives in New Jersey's 12th district against five-term Republican Congressman Robert Kean. Kean defeated Dudkin by 4,737 votes, 63,232 (50.8%) to 58, 495 (47.0%). President Harry Truman, campaigning in Newark on October 6, endorsed Dudkin, saying: \"That means that here in Newark you're going to send Peter Rodino to the Congress, and Hugh Addonizio and Harry Dudkin to the House of Representatives. Every one of these men deserves your support. They will fight your battle in Washington, and how that fight needs to be made nobody knows better than I do. They will fight your battle there, and men like them all over the Nation will be fighting that battle--and will win that battle if you're behind us--the battle for the people, a fight which started with Jefferson, continued with Jackson, was won by Franklin Roosevelt in 1934.\" Dudkin ran again in 1950, and lost by 8,598 votes, 54,123(53.1%) to 45,525 (44.7%). Dudkin was married to Hanna Levitin (1910-1993) of Norfolk, Virginia. They had one daughter, Gail Elizabeth, who married Ronald Merson. On March 5, 1987, Dudkin was murdered while working at his family stationery store in East Orange, New Jersey. \"At first, detectives theorized that he had fallen and hit his head, but an autopsy the next day uncovered a .38-caliber slug in his head,\" the (Newark) Star-Ledger wrote in a story about cold cases. \"By the time detectives canvassed the neighborhood, the crime was two days old.\" Only then did investigators realize that the store's daily receipts were missing.\" Dudkin was 76. His murder remains unsolved."

Over the years, Shaw has run for United States Senator, U.S. House of Representatives, State Senator, Assemblyman, Hudson County Executive, Hudson County Sheriff, Hudson County Freeholder, North Bergen Commissioner, and the North Bergen Board of Education. He has never received as much as 5% of the vote. \"My motive is revenge,\" Shaw told a reporter in 2011. His most recent campaign was in 2014, when he challenged Congressman Albio Sires. He received 921 votes, 1.5%. He ran for the United States Senate in 1978, finishing third in a field of seven candidates, running more than 1 million votes behind the winner, Bill Bradley. He received 4,736 votes, a little less than one-quarter of one percent. Shaw has run against six Congressmen: Henry Helstoski, Harold Hollenbeck, Frank Guarini, Robert Torricelli, Bob Menendez, and Albio Sires. In 2012, he went to public meeting of the North Bergen Board of Commissioners to complain that police had not yet located a bathtub stolen from his backyard. He said the backyard of his house \"is packed with junk, including a rusty school bus, old tires, several cars, an unused van, tables, and a variety of other items.\" Shaw: “I’m one of the original hunter gatherers. Call me a hoarder, collector, whatever you want, but I have a lot of antiques.”"

  "text" : "Henry Parker (3 August 1819 – 20 October 1901) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, the Cambridge Town Club, Kent and other amateur teams between 1839 and 1854. He was born at Ongar, Essex, and died at St Mary in the Marsh, Kent. The son of Henry J. Parker who was Gresham Professor of Divinity and vicar of High Halden in Kent, Parker was educated at Maidstone and at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Parker played most of his early cricket as a middle-order batsman, though he rarely seemed to make many runs; an exception was his solitary appearance in the University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford in 1839, in which he made 43, by some distance his best score in first-class cricket. After a solitary appearance for Kent in 1841, the rest of his cricket was played for the amateur Gentlemen of Kent side, and though detailed scorecards from his era are not often available, he seems to have developed as a bowler: against the Gentlemen of England in 1845, he batted at No 11 but took four wickets, though the scorecard also records he bowled 12 wides. It is not known whether batted or bowled right- or left-handed, nor his style of bowling. Parker graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1842. He was ordained as a Church of England clergyan and served as curate to his father at High Halden from 1842 to 1849. He then moved to Old Romney for four years, then to Whitstable and Seasalter, all in Kent, before becoming rector of St Mary in the Marsh in 1857, where he stayed in post until his death 44 years later."

Her books have twice been named to the list of Top Ten Chinese Novels Worldwide, in 2008 and 2009. Hon's clean, absurd and abstract style has been compared to Franz Kafka, and her intensely psychological stories often reflect her characters’ inner struggles for freedom, against the futility of attempts to find meaning in everyday existence; to Hon’s characters, the “way out” lies in transformation that comes from overturning established identities."

  "text" : "Henry Perkins (10 December 1832 – 6 May 1916) was an English lawyer, cricketer and cricket administrator. He played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, Cambridgeshire, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and various amateur sides between 1854 and 1868, and he was the secretary of the MCC from 1876 to 1898. He was born at Sawston, Cambridgeshire, and died at New Barnet, then in Hertfordshire. The son of the curate of Sawston, Perkins was educated at Bury St Edmunds and at Trinity College, Cambridge. His father died when he was five years old, but at seven he inherited an estate at Thriplow, Cambridgeshire. He was at Cambridge University from the autumn of 1850, but appeared in important cricket only in his later years there, and his sole first-class match for the first team was the 1854 University Match against Oxford University; at the end of the first day in this game Cambridge, already facing a first-innings deficit of 68, had lost seven wickets for just 13 runs in their second innings, but on the second morning Perkins made 27 out of a final total of 60. Leaving Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1854 – converted to a Master of Arts in 1857 – Perkins qualified as a barrister at the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1858, practising on the Norfolk Circuit. He played intermittent first-class cricket matches from 1856 to 1868, appearing most regularly for the Cambridgeshire county team, which was first-class in some games until the late 1860s, and where he also acted as honorary secretary. A lower-order, sometimes tail-end, right-handed batsman and a right-arm underarm lob bowler, his best bowling came in an 1862 Cambridgeshire match against Nottinghamshire, taking five second innings wickets (out of seven that fell) for just 48 runs. He had earlier taken five wickets for 83 runs for the \"Gentlemen of the North\" against the \"Gentlemen of the South\" in a match in 1859 and in this game he also scored 36 in the first innings, which was his highest first-class score. Perkins became secretary of the MCC in 1876 and remained in the post for 22 years; he instituted the annual meeting of the county club secretaries at which the fixture list was agreed, with the counties that achieved a threshold number of home and away fixtures qualifying from 1890 for the County Championship. At his retirement in 1898, when he was succeeded by Francis Lacey, he was voted an annual pension of £400 a year and given life membership. MCC membership doubled from 2,000 to 4,000 during his tenure, and he was also responsible for a written history of the club at its centenary in 1887. He was also an author in his legal career, acting as editor of Dixon's Law of the Farm. In 1855, Perkins married Blanche, daughter of Charles Fiddey; three of their sons also attended Cambridge University."

  "text" : "Howard Walter Blakeslee (March 21, 1880 - May 2, 1952) was an American journalist. He was the Associated Press's first full-time science reporter and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1937. Blakeslee was born in 1880 to Jesse Walter Blakeslee and Jennie (Howard) in New Dungeness (now Dungeness), Washington. After attending the University of Michigan, he became, in 1901, a news writer (soon after, feature writer) for the Detroit Journal. Between 1903 and 1905, he was a sports writer for Chicago and Detroit newspapers. He joined the Associated Press in 1906. Between then and 1916, he was a bureau chief in New Orleans, Atlanta, and Dallas. He was news editor in Chicago from 1916 to 1926, then moved to New York where, after two years as photo service editor, his title became Science Editor, AP's first. Blakeslee (along with four other reporters from different papers) won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize for the group's collective coverage of science at Harvard University's tercentenary celebration. A better-known winner that year was Margaret Mitchell, who won for Gone With the Wind. Blakeslee reported extensively on the atomic bomb in the immediate post-war era and was among the group of reporters who witnessed the early tests at Yucca Flat. Also interested in the subject of atomic power, his book publications include Miracle of Atomics (1945), The Atomic Future (1946), and Atomic Progress: The Hydrogen Race (1951). In addition to the Pulitzer, his awards include the National Headliners Club award (1940), the George Westinghouse Science Writers award of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1946). The Howard W. Blakeslee Award of the American Heart Association is named in his honor. Blakeslee was married twice, first in 1906 to Marguerite Fortune and second, after the death of his first wife, to Rosamund Robinson in 1936. Blakeslee and Rosamund had three children: Howard, Rosamund, and Alan. His son from his first marriage, Alton Blakeslee, eventually succeeded him as science editor at AP, retiring in 1985. His granddaughter (Alton's daughter) is Sandra Blakeslee, a long-time science reporter for the New York Times. Sandra's son Matthew Blakeslee is also a full-time science writer, thus representing the fourth generation of Howard Blakeslee's notable science-reportorial dynasty. Howard Blakeslee died in 1952, shortly after returning from return a visit to the atomic bomb testing site in Nevada."

He was born at Buntingford, Hertfordshire and died in Manitoba, Canada. His twin brother, Charles Pigg, also played first-class cricket. Pigg was educated at Abington House School, Northampton, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, Pigg was a right-handed middle or lower order batsman and a right-arm round-arm fast bowler. He was successful as a batsman in his second game for the university side, scoring 34 not out and 32 against the MCC. This led to his selection for the 1877 University Match against Oxford University, though he was not successful. He played only one further match for Cambridge University in the 1878 season. Pigg graduated from Cambridge University in 1879 with a Bachelor of Arts degree; this was converted to a Master of Arts in 1885. He appeared in first-class cricket matches at the Hastings end-of-season cricket festival from 1886 to 1891, and these included several games in the North v South and Gentlemen v Players series, though he did not play in any of the \"major\" London-based fixtures. In 1886, he scored 59 and took four second innings wickets when a South team played the Australians. And in 1889 he took seven second innings wickets for 55 runs (and 11 for 112 in the match) as the Gentlemen beat the Players by one wicket. He played minor cricket for Hertfordshire from the 1870s and was the team's captain in Minor Counties matches from 1895 to 1897."

He still holds many American records. In 1998 he was elected into the USATF Masters Hall of Fame. He was originally from Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where his parents Elmer and Alma Chapson were regarded as pioneers. His mother lived to age 103, dying in Sebastopol, California in 1983 where she was an avid walker into her second century. Chapson was involved in track and field for more than 60 years dating back to the 1920s. He was a track star at Colorado A&M in 1925 and 1926. His autobiography shares the harsh living conditions from his days as a child. He served as president of the Mid-Pacific Road Running Club starting in 1976 and also worked as a track official. The club hosts the Harold Chapson Memorial 8K starting and finishing in Kapiolani Park every January. He was part of the Faces in the Crowd section of Sports Illustrated, August 20, 1973 issue. On his 80th birthday, he set the M80 world record in the 800 meters and 1500 meters. He further improved the 800 record, the 1500 record lasted for just over 29 years."

Film critic Donald Richie regarded him as the \"humanist\" among Kurosawa's writers. In 2013, Oguni and frequent screenwriting collaborators Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto and Ryuzo Kikushima were awarded the Jean Renoir Award by the Writers Guild of America West. Writing credits other than for Kurosawa films include Heinosuke Gosho's Entotsu no mieru basho in 1953, Koji Shima's Warning from Space in 1956, Tora! Tora!

  "text" : "Hazel B. Garland (January 28, 1913 – April 5, 1988) was a journalist, columnist and newspaper editor. She was the first African American woman to serve as editor-in-chief of a nationally circulated newspaper chain (the New Pittsburgh Courier). Born into a farming family, she was the eldest of sixteen children. Although a bright and capable student, she dropped out of high school at her fathers instigation, and spent time working as a maid in order to provide financial assistance to her family. After her marriage in 1935 she became a housewife, raising her daughter Phyllis and playing an active role in various voluntary organisations. Her reports of club activities gained her attention from local newspaper editors and by 1943 she was writing a regular column. In 1946 she joined the staff of the Pittsburgh Courier full-time, and by 1960 she was editor of both the entertainment and the women's sections of the newspaper. In 1955 she became the first African American journalist to write a regular television column, Video Vignettes, which would go on to become one of the longest running television columns in newspaper history. In 1974 Garland was made editor-in-chief, and in the same year she was named 'Editor of the Year' by the National Newspaper Publishers Association. She retired from her editorial role in 1977 due to health problems, although she continued writing and remained in an advisory role to the publishers until her death in 1988. In 1978 and 1979 she served as a juror for the Pulitzer Prize for journalism."

From wide spread homophobic music such as promoting the murdering of gay men to the church, and propaganda all fuel homophobia in the country. LGBT people in Jamaica get little or no protection by the police, and even cops increase violence against them. LGBT ads are not permitted on television or newspapers as it was considered illegal before it was challenged by Gay Rights Activist Maurice Tomlinson. The killing of 16-year-old Dwayne Jones at a party sparked international concern over the homophobia present in the country."

  "text" : "Heather Firbank (27 August 1888 – 13 April 1954) was an English socialite, now known for her fine collection of clothes kept at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A), London. Her father Sir Joseph Thomas Firbank (1850–1910) was a British Conservative politician, while her grandfather Joseph Firbank (1819–1886) built the family fortune as a railway contractor. Her older brother Ronald Firbank became famous after his death for his innovative novels. Heather Firbank was born in England on 27 August 1888, at The Coopers, Chislehurst, Kent, the youngest of the four children of Sir Thomas and Lady Firbank, who was formerly Harriet Jane Garrett. She had three elder brothers, Joseph Sydney (1884–1904), Arthur Annesley Ronald (1886–1926), the novelist, and Hubert Somerset (1887–1913). She was educated at home by a governess and was presented at Court on 15 May 1908. Heather Firbank bought her clothes from highly-regarded dressmakers and tailors in London, including Lucile, Mascotte, Redfern, Frederick Bosworth, Russell & Allen, Kate Reily, and the department store Woolland Brothers in Knightsbridge. The evening gown illustrated at right was designed by Lucile, one of the leading couturiers from the late 1890s to the early 1920s. The dress was named \"El Dorado\" and first appeared in Lucile's Spring 1913 collection. Two of Firbank's brothers died in their twenties, her father in 1910, and her mother in 1924. When her brother Ronald, the last member of her immediate family, died in 1926, she put most of her clothes into storage. She never married, and after her death in 1954 her wardrobe was inherited by her nephew, Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Firbank (1910–2000). The extensive collection then came to the attention of the Victoria and Albert Museum and was acquired in 1957, becoming the foundation for the museum’s well-known collection of 20th century fashion. An exhibition of Firbank’s clothes was held at the V&A in 1960 entitled A Lady of Fashion: Heather Firbank (1888-1954) and what she wore between 1908 and 1921. Other items from Heather Firbank's extraordinary wardrobe survive in the Museum of London, the Gallery of Costume in Manchester, Nottingham Museum, Leicester Museum, and Northampton Museum. The V&A's Firbank collection is the subject of its forthcoming publication entitled London Society Fashion 1905-1925: The Wardrobe of Heather Firbank, by Cassie Davies-Strodder, Jenny Lister and Lou Taylor."

  "text" : "Herbert Raab (born January 24, 1969 in Linz, Austria) is an Austrian software engineer, amateur astronomer and discoverer of astronomical objects. He finished his studies of computer science at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz in 1995 as a graduate engineer. In 2012, he received the Master of Science in Management for Engineers at the LIMAK business school in Linz, where he also graduated as Master of Business Administration in 2013. He works as a software engineer in the field of commercial software. In 1983, he joined the Astronomical Society of Linz (Linzer Astronomische Gemeinschaft), since 1996 he is president of that society. Since 1990, he has been developing the widely used software Astrometrica, which is used for astrometric and photometric analysis of images of asteroids and comets. Raab's most important observations include precise astrometry of the comet Shoemaker–Levy 9, which he observed together with Erich Meyer and Erwin Obermair in 1993. These observations have significantly contributed to the subsequent prediction of the impact of this comet on the planet Jupiter. On August 10, 1997, he discovered the asteroid 13682 Pressberger together with Erich Meyer at the private observatory Meyer/Obermair in Davidschlag (municipality Kirchschlag bei Linz, Austria). Furthermore, he was involved in three other discoveries of asteroids which were assigned as site discoveries to the observatory Davidschlag by the International Astronomical Union (see Category:Discoveries by the Davidschlag Observatory). During the Occultation of the star HIP 76293 by the asteroid 1177 Gonnessia on May 18, 2007, Raab discovered that the star is a close double star, whose components have a separation of just 0.04\". In May 1996, asteroid 3184 Raab was named in his honor, following a proposal of Brian G. Marsden and Gareth V. Williams from the Minor Planet Center (M.P.C. 27124). On April 4, 1997, Raab was presented the Gold Medal for Services to the Republic of Austria."

  "text" : "Harold D. Roth is Professor of Religious Studies and the Director of the Contemplative Studies Initiative. Roth is a specialist in Methods of Textual Criticism and Textual History, Classical Chinese Religious Thought, Classical Daoism, the Comparative Study of Mysticism and one of the pioneers of the new interdisciplinary academic field of Contemplative Studies. During an academic career spanning over three decades, Roth has done ground- breaking work in three major intellectual fields. In the first, textual criticism, following the lead of the late SOAS professor Paul Thompson, Roth did the first complete textual history of a major Classical Chinese philosophical work, which he published in his first book, The Textual History of the Huai-nan Tzu. Working towards the goal of establishing modern critical editions of all the major extant works of the classical period, Roth developed a distinctive method he called “Filiation Analysis,” a technique for determining the broadest range of possibly authentic textual variants using the bare minimum number of editions. This is detailed in his very first publication, \"Filiation Analysis and the Textual Criticism of the Huai-nan Tzu,\". It is further developed as a model for all classical Chinese philosophical texts in a later publication, \"Text and Edition in Early Chinese Philosophical Literature\". The second major area in which Roth has done pioneering work is in reconstructing the lost history and contemplative dimensions of the late Warring States and early Han dynasty tradition that he dubbed “inner cultivation.” It is this tradition that was given the moniker “Daoism” by the Grand Historian Sima Tan circa 110 BCE. Beginning with three publications in the early to mid 1990’s, \"Psychology and Self-Cultivation in Early Taoistic Thought,\"  \"Who Compiled the Chuang Tzu?\", and \"Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Taoism,\"  Roth began a detailed textual analysis of classical Chinese texts on inner cultivation demonstrating that they contained a distinctive set of technical terms that could be organized under three philosophical categories: cosmology, psychology/inner cultivation, and political thought. Expanding the work of A.C. Graham, he further determined that these extant sources of inner cultivation could be organized into three distinctive philosophical groupings, “Individualist,” Primitivist, and Syncretist and argued these could be considered different phases in the development of this classical Daoist tradition. Roth systematized these arguments in providing the intellectual context for his translation of a short and distinctive text entitled Neiye 內業 (“Inward Training”), one of 76 works in the Guanzi 管子compendium, published in his second book, Original Tao: Inward Training and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism and returned to them in a recent article detailed the contributions to the development of the foundational philosophical idea of li 理 (Pattern, Principle) made by this classical Daoist tradition in “The Classical Daoist Concept of Li and Early Chinese Cosmology.” In developing these theories about the inner cultivation tradition Roth broke new ground in systematically applying the methods of the philosophical analysis of different traditions of mystical experience to the classical Chinese religious traditions. In addition to being summarized in Original Tao, his work in this area is detailed in a number of important other publications: “Evidence for Stages of Meditation in Early Taoism,” “Lao Tzu in the Context of Early Taoist Mystical Praxis,” and “Bimodal Mystical Experience in the ‘Qiwulun’ of Zhuangzi\". Starting when he entered the Ph.D. program at the University of Toronto in 1975, Roth began a fascination with the early Han dynasty (139 BCE) philosophical compendium, the Huainanzi 淮南子, until recently the last great untranslated work of classical Chinese philosophy. Intended as a comprehensive multi-authored text detailing all the fields of knowledge with which the Chinese emperor needed to be conversant, the Huainanzi contains chapters on cosmology and cosmogony, astronomy, geography, rulership, and warfare, to name a few of its major topics. Roth has argued that while the Huainanzi is inclusive of a very wide range philosophical ideas from many traditions, that its overarching intellectual context is provided by the inner cultivation tradition of classical Daoism. After working on the textual history of this major work in his first book, in the mid 1990s Roth developed a project for the first complete English translation with colleague John Major and, eventually, a small cohort of additional scholars that included, most importantly, Sarah Queen and Andrew Meyer. Together they succeeded in finally publishing a complete translation, The Huainanzi: A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Government in Early Han China and an abridged translation, The Essential Huainanzi. In addition to his work on these translations and to his first book, Roth has published his ideas on the philosophy of the Huainanzi in a number of publications, including \"The Concept of Human Nature in the Huai-nan Tzu,\" \"Nature and Self-Cultivation in Huainanzi's 'Original Way,'\" “Daoist Inner Cultivation Thought and the Textual Structure of the Huainanzi,” and “Huainanzi 淮 南 子and Early Han Daoism.” Roth has not only been a leader in developing the new academic field of “Contemplative Studies,” he is also the person who first coined the term. Combining the disciplines of the relevant Brain Sciences, Humanities, and Creative Arts around the systematic third and first-person study of contemplative experiences, across cultures and across time, this new field presents bold new pedagogies and research techniques that return the unbiased perspective of the experiencing subject to both classroom and laboratory. Inspired by the work of scientists such as Francisco Varela, James Austin, and Richard Davidson, philosophers such as William James and Evan Thompson, and educators such as John Dewey and Parker Palmer, Brown Contemplative Studies has served as a model for research institutes and academic programs at many institutions of higher education throughout North America. Roth has helped pioneer the field through such publications as “Contemplative Studies: Prospects for a New Field,\" Columbia Teacher’s College Record (2006); “Against Cognitive Imperialism,” Religion East and West (2008); “Contemplative Studies: Can It Flourish in the Religious Studies Classroom?” Meditation and the Classroom: Contemplative Pedagogy for Religious Studies (2011); and “A Pedagogy for the New Field of Contemplative Studies,” Contemplative Approaches to Learning and Inquiry across Disciplines (2014). In 2014 Brown University became the first major North American Research University to establish a formal undergraduate concentration (major) in Contemplative Studies. This pioneering multi-disciplinary concentration requires 14 courses including a core set of 5 required courses in relevant Brain Sciences and Humanities. Students then choose a Sciences track that features Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience or a Humanities Track that features Philosophy of Mind and Contemplative Religious Traditions. Art concentrations within the Humanities Track are also possible. Additionally, Roth has served these academic fields in a variety of ways. He served on the Board of Directors of the Society for the Study of Chinese Religions for a decade starting in 1993, during which time he has also served on the editorial boards of four international journals of Daoism and Early Chinese Studies. In addition to this he was the founder and Co-Organizer of the New England Symposium on Chinese Thought (1988–93), the organizer of four academic panels at the Association for Asian Studies and American Oriental Society, and the Co-Organizer of the Second American-Japanese Conference on Taoist Studies (1998). He has been a member of the initial Steering Committees for two groups within the American Academy of Religion, the Daoist Studies Section and the Contemplative Studies Group. He has been on the planning committees for the Mind and Life Institute Summer Research Institutes and the first and second International Symposia on Contemplative Studies (2012 and 2014).

He was a sub-editor in Fremtiden from 1907 to 1914, journalist in Social-Demokraten from 1914 to 1919, then editor-in-chief of Folket from 1919 to 1921. In 1921 the Social Democratic Labour Party split from the Labour Party, and Amundsen worked in their main organ Den Nye Social-Demokraten from 1921 to 1927. The party reunited with Labour in 1927, and Amundsen returned to Arbeiderbladet (formerly Social-Demokraten) and spent the rest of his career there. He was also a local politician, biographer of Christopher Hornsrud (1939) and Trygve Lie (1946), and was a board member of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation from 1935 to 1956."

  "text" : "Harry Owen White (11 February 1898 – 2 October 1946) was an Australian politician. He was a United Australia Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1932 to 1943, representing the electorate of Bulla and Dalhousie. White was born in North Melbourne, and attended Ascot Vale State School. He served in the armed forces in World War I, initially with the Royal Australian Artillery at Queenscliff, and later in France with the siege battalion, where he transferred to the Royal Air Force and Australian Flying Corps. He subsequently worked as an engineer before entering politics. White was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1932 state election, defeating incumbent Labor MP and future federal minister Reg Pollard. He was re-elected in 1935, 1937 and 1940, defeating future state MP Charlie Mutton on each occasion. White served as secretary to the parliamentary United Australia Party and as party whip both in government and in opposition from 1935 until 1940. He relinquished his parliamentary roles that year due to his service in World War II, in which he was attached to an armoured division. White ultimately attained the rank of major, but had a breakdown in health in 1943, and spent some months in a military hospital. He did not contest the 1943 state election, at which his seat was won by Reginald James of the rival conservative Country Party. White died in October 1946, and was cremated at Fawkner Crematorium."

Gentillon holds dual Haitian-U.S. citizenship and studies in Europe. He reveals the convenience of being able to travel the world with an American passport. Nevertheless, he also shows his pride for his native country with the film Love Me Haiti, which won the 2014 Haitian Oscar. Gentillon's MFA thesis film got distribution deals right after graduation. His embellishment of the properties and characterization of the protagonist and proper cast paid off. Gentillon selected, directed and ensured that French actress Aurelia Khazan's interpretation of the character Jeudi Forstner fits in with the nuances of the overall picture to bring together the story and that the story is told in line with his vision – making French actress Aurelia Khazan won Best Interpretation Award/Unesco Prize for Peace."

Raymond-Barker was educated at Winchester College and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He played cricket for Winchester as a middle-order batsman and a bowler, though it is not known if he was right- or left-handed or what style of bowling he practised. At Cambridge and for the MCC, he appears not to have bowled, though full scorecards are not available for most of his matches. He appeared in three matches for Cambridge, including the University Match of 1844 against Oxford University, in which he scored eight runs in his only innings, the second highest score for the Cambridge team. Although he played as a batsman, his highest innings in eight first-class games was only 14. Raymond-Barker graduated from Cambridge University in 1844 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in the same year and was called to the bar in 1849."

  "text" : "Heinz Drewes (1903–1980) was a German conductor and in 1937–1944 head of division X (music) of Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda at the time when Reichsmusikkammer was led by Peter Raabe from 1935 onwards. He was one of the most influential people in German music world at that time. Drewes was head of division X (music) subordinated divisions: Reich Music Examination Office, Reichsstelle für Musikbearbeitungen, Auslandsstelle für Musik, Amt für Konzertwesen. Drewes and Raabe struggled on \"the leadership in music,\" and this made Joseph Goebbels happy as he could use their words as a threat to one or the other. Drewes worked in Deutsches Nationaltheater und Staatskapelle Weimar as a répétiteur and conductor. In 1930 he went in Landestheater in Altenburg (Theater & Philharmonie Thüringen) as a conductor. He started there a local chapter for KfdK (Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur) and the same year he went in NSDAP and wrote articles in NS-Zeitung and Völkischer Beobachter. Deutscher Musiker-Kalender tells in 1943 he was Generalintendant and Generalmusikdirektor. Denazified Drewes worked after the war in Nürnberg Conservatory. Later a story emerged that Drewes used pseudonyms as he conducted when working in the propaganda ministry. He conducted only with the radio orchestras. It was he who hired and fired the conductors. He may have used the name Hermann Desser when he conducted Felix Draeseke's Symphonia Tragica with Berlin Symphony Orchestra, published in 1955 by Urania Records. Alan Krueck says there is no such conductor as Hermann Desser, and the music was typical for the Third Reich and on the other hand the quality of the recording was consistent with that achievable at the time. Later Christoph Schlüren also identifies Drewes. Drewes appreciated Jean Sibelius and was the president of the German Sibelius Society (Deutsche Sibelius Gesellschaft). He wrote a preface to Ernst Tanzberger's dissertation Die symphonischen Dichtungen, von Jean Sibelius, eine inhalts- und formanalytische Studie (K. Triltsch, 1943). Tommi Mäkelä writes in his Sibelius biography that it was explicitly meant to be a greeting 'to our Finnish friends and comrades-in-arm.' Drewes himself writes that the symphonic sagas of Sibelius evidence that \"while the Finnish Volk could be counted racially among the Finno-Ugric tribe,\" over centuries it had \"turned happily toward the German world\". Drewes was a friend of Richard Strauss, who asked him extend his protection to Strauss' libretist Joseph Gregor. Strauss again asked protection in 1939 to his non-Aryan daughter-in-law and grandchildren. The Swedish composer Kurt Atterberg was worried about the German conductor Helmuth Thierfelder whether he could conduct Attenberg's compositions, and about his possibilities to visit Sweden. The concertmaster of Philharmonischen Orchester Landestheater Coburg Ralph Braun says the significance of Drewes has not been known until today."

  "text" : "(For the Nottinghamshire cricketer, see Henry Richardson (cricketer, born 1857).) Henry Adair Richardson (31 July 1846 – 17 September 1921) was an English businessman and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, Kent, Middlesex and the Gentlemen between 1866 and 1871. He was born in Bayswater, London and died at Hastings, East Sussex. Richardson was educated at Tonbridge School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. A right-handed middle-order batsman, occasional wicketkeeper and even more occasional bowler of unknown style, he played first-team cricket for his school from the age of 15. At Cambridge in 1866, however, he played in only one first-class match. But when the university season was over, he appeared in five matches for Kent, and scored 50 in the second innings of his first game for the county, against Sussex. He improved on that with an innings of 92 in a return match later in the season. In the three seasons from 1867 to 1869, Richardson played regularly for the Cambridge first team and in the first two of these years was successful as a batsman; he played in all three years in the University Match against Oxford University. From 1868 he also started keeping wicket for Cambridge in occasional games and he retained that position in the 1869 season, though he did not keep wicket for other teams. In the 1869 University Match, he made four stumpings and two catches, but he was unsuccessful with the bat in all of his games against Oxford. His best season with the bat was 1868 when he scored his only century, an innings of 143 for Cambridge University against Surrey at The Oval. In the same season he played against Surrey on two other occasions too, once each for Kent and Middlesex, and also appeared in two Gentlemen v Players games. Richardson graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1869. He played no more first-class cricket after single matches in both 1870 and 1871. He went into business in Mumbai, then called Bombay, and was later chairman of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank and cited as an expert on trade in Egypt."

He was Professor of Accounting at the Helsinki School of Economics from 1955 to 1963 beside Martti Saario, and its Dean from 1961 to 1963.

In the work he expressed the view that \"accounting is a management tool without any right to an existence of its own.\" Accounting needed to supply the input for management functions as planning and control."

  "text" : "Henry Dasson (1825–1896) was a renowned nineteenth century Parisian maker of gilt-bronze mounted furniture. Unlike other cabinetmakers of the time Dasson began his career as a bronze sculptor, and consequently one characteristic of his work is the quality of his bronze and more precisely of the chiselling. His Paris workshop was situated at 106 rue Vieille-du-Temple, where he specialised in the production of Louis XIV, XV and XVI style furniture using the finest gilt-bronze mounts. In 1871, he purchased the flourishing business and remaining stock of Charles-Guillaume Winckelsen, known for the high quality of his furniture. It has been suggested that Dasson inherited the craft of ciseleur from Winckelsen. At the 1878 and 1889 Paris Expositions Universelles Dasson exhibited a number of pieces in the Louis XV and XVI styles, as well as pieces of his own modified eighteenth-century design. The exhibits in 1878 included a table entirely in gilt-bronze, purchased by Lord Dudley. His copy of the celebrated Bureau du Roi sold at the same exhibition to Lady Ashburton. Dasson ceased production in 1894, and at this time held a sale of his models, listed in 'Catalogues of drawings for art bronzes, style furniture and important decoration with rights of reproduction by Henry Dasson et Cie, manufacturer of art bronzes and cabinetmaker as a result of cessation of production..' The records from this sale show that Paul Sormani, as well as Joseph Emmanuel Zweiner, Maison Millet and Beurdeley acquired certain drawings and models by Dasson."
