  "text" : "Ivone Gebara (born 1944) is a Brazilian Catholic nun, philosopher, and feminist theologian. Ivone Gebara was born in São Paulo on December 9, 1944 to a family of Syrian-Lebanese descent. After receiving a degree in philosophy, she joined the Augustinian Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady in 1967 at the age of 22. She earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from the Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo. Gebara taught at the Instituto Teológico do Recife (ITER) for almost 17 years alongside founder Hélder Câmara. Linked to liberation theology, the institution existed from 1968 until it was closed by order of the Vatican in 1989. Since then she has devoted her time to writing and delivering courses and lectures around the world, on the foundations of religious discourse. Since 1973 Gebara has lived in the Northeast Region. She currently lives in a poor neighborhood of Camaragibe in the Recife metropolitan area, 25 km from Recife. In the 1990s, Gebara was tried and convicted by the Vatican for criticizing the moral teaching of the Church, especially due to comments she made in an interview printed in Veja magazine in regard to abortion. She was ordered to two years of forced silence. During that time, she obtained her second doctorate, in Religious Studies from the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. Gebara wrote a book addressing evil, Rompendo o silêncio: uma fenomenologia feminista do mal."

  "text" : "Ivo Illuminati (11 June 1882 – 6 September 1963) was an Italian film director, actor and screenwriter and a pioneer of the Italian silent movie. In 1887 he moved with his parents and two brothers from his native Ripatransone to Rome, where his father worked as a state civil servant. There Illuminati met personnel of Auguste and Louis Lumière, who imported the new techniques of the cinema from France and taught them to young people. He became a pupil of Gaston Velle, director of the production company Cines and learned how to use the movie camera. Between 1902 and 1913 he made many short films of 2 to 5 minutes duration, in which many Italian actors made their debut, e.g., Hesperia, Leda Gys, Diomira Jacobini, Maria Jacobini, Fulvia Perini, and Elvira Radaelli. Illumnati himself had his first role in Emilio Ghione's Gespay, fantino e gentiluomo in 1914. In the same year his career as a film director took off with La fanciulla di Capri, Una donna and Mamma perdona. He became an established figure in the Italian movie scene with Leda innamorata, Quando la primavera ritornò, Sotto l'ala della morte, I re, le torri, gli alfieri (1916) and Emir, cavallo da circo (1917). The last two films are considered to be among his best works. In 1917 Illuminati changed his production company from Medusa Film to Silentium Film of Milan, with whom he made La nemica (1917) and Automartirio (1917). However, Illuminati ran into conflicts with a film critic who preferred American imported movies and with the Italian government, which cut 600 meters from his film La vita è fumo (1918). A similar fate hit Tombola (1918, with neorealist leanings) and La stirpe (1918). Tombola convinced a public which in general preferred movies from the United States. In the 1920s Illuminati's career halted because of the advent of sound movies and the death of his beloved actress Margherita Soave, who starred in Alba rossa (1920). In 1921 he still directed three movies and finally became an assistant-director for Carmine Gallone's Giuseppe Verdi (1938). In 1941 Illuminati directed his last film, Il vetturale del San Gottardo, even if the Italian Ministry of Popular Culture forced the collaboration of the German Hans Hinrich on him. Forgotten by the public, Ivo Illuminati died at Rome in 1963. Most of Illuminati's production is lost, but the Italian Cineteca Nazionale at Rome curates restaured copies of Selika (1921) and Vetturale del San Gottardo (1941) which were presented at the Venice Film Festival in 2011. In 2013, Tragico convegno (1915) was discovered at EYE Film Institute Netherlands (although the third reel was missing) and was subsequently presented at the Festival del Cinema Ritrovato in Bologna."

  "text" : "Ivo Varbanov is a Bulgarian concert pianist and winemaker. He started playing piano aged 6 with Eleonora Karamisheva. He studied under Riccardo Bertazzolo and Ylonka Deckers from 1987 to 1993. After graduating he travelled to England on a Rotary Scholarship for postgraduate study at the Royal Academy of Music under Sulamita Aronowsky and Frank Wibaut, finishing in 1998. He studied privately with Dennis Lee and attended several masterclasses by artists such as Alexander Lonquich and Lev Naumov. He has led masterclasses himself at the Bulgarian National Music School in Sofia, Hochschule für Musik Luzern in Switzerland, and at the Radom Music School in Poland. After a hiatus in 2009-2012, due to leukaemia, he returned to the stage with performances at the Royal Festival Hall with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Kings Place, and Cadogan Hall. His performances have been broadcast on Bulgarian National Radio, BBC Radio, RAI 3, Bulgarian National Television, among others. His recording of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition by Gega New CD was described by the BBC Music Magazine as \"enchanting\", and by Suono Magazine as possessing \"notable interpretative quality\". He released three other recordings with that label. In 2004 Varbanov took up winemaking, while continuing his musical career, planting a small vineyard in southern Bulgaria and producing his first wine in 2008. He also founded the Bulgarian Association of Independent Winegrowers. Fiammetta Tarli, his wife, is also a concert pianist, often playing with him. Together they founded in 2014 ICSM (Independent Creative Sound & Music) Records, which was funded by a Kickstarter campaign."

  "text" : "Ian \"Hep\" Hepburn (1902–74) was a British schoolmaster, botanist, ecologist and author. He was educated at Oxford University, and was a chemistry teacher at Oundle School 1925–64. For much of his time there, he was a housemaster; latterly he was Second Master. He was elected Member of the Royal Archaeological Institute in 1950. He published papers on the vegetation of coastal Cornwall and Norfolk (places he had known from boyhood), and on that of Northamptonshire Jurassic limestone. He served on the Council of the British Ecological Society, and was active as a journal editor. He was a member of several natural history clubs and trusts in Northamptonshire and, later, Cambridgeshire. He has been described as, \"a modest man, courteous, patient, popular with students and staff\". As well as being a devoted teacher, he loved music: the Hepburn Music Competition at Oundle was started by him (while Second Master) in the early 1950s, and is named after him. He dedicated his book Flowers of the Coast to his wife Phyllis, \"who loves the sea but is sometimes uncertain of her botany\". An early review remarks, \"This book, so clearly and unpretentiously written, so admirably illustrated, is imaginatively stimulating to a quite unusual degree. No fringe of beach or, scrubby headland, no strip of brackish marsh, no tidal estuary can seem, when one has read it, devoid of interest."

  "text" : "Isaac Myers (January 13, 1835 – 1891) was a pioneering African American trade unionist, a co-operative organizer and a caulker from Baltimore, Maryland. Myers was born as a free black, though Maryland was a slave state. Since the state of Maryland did not offer public education for African American youth. Myers had to acquire his early education from a private day school run by Rev. John Fortie. At the age of 16 he began work as a caulker, sealing seams in ships. In the 1850s Myers married Emma V. Morgan, who died in 1868. With her they had three children, including political activist George A. Myers. He later married Sarah E. Deaver. In 1860, Myers left caulking to work in a grocery business leading him to set up a short lived co-operative grocery in 1864. He returned to caulking in 1865. After the American Civil War competition for jobs led to strikes and protests by white workers, forcing over 1000 black caulkers to lose their jobs. Myers proposed the workers collectively pool resources and form a co-operative shipyard and railway, the Chesapeake Marine Railway and Dry Dock Company, to provide themselves with employment. The co-operative, opening in February 1866, was initially a great success, employing over 300 black workers. Myers and others also established the Colored Caulkers Trade Union Society in 1868, to which he was elected President. The National Labor Union took interest, inviting the Colored Caulkers Trade Union Society to their annual convention. The move was significant for what had previously been an all-white union, but black workers continued to face opposition to membership. In response the Colored National Labor Union was established in 1869, with Myers as President. He was succeeded in 1872 as President by Frederick Douglass. Following his departure from the CFNL Myer's continued working and contributing to the labor movement. He became increasingly involved in the Republican Party during the 1870s. Working as both a Customs Service agent and as a postal service agent under Lincoln, before returning to operate a coal yard in Baltimore. \"Myer's also organized and became President of the Maryland Colored State Industrial Fair Association, the Colored Business Men's Association of Baltimore, the Colored Building and Loan Association, and the Aged Ministers Home of the A.M.E. Church\". The Frederick Douglass - Isaac Myers Maritime Park in Baltimore is named after Myers."

Linow's monikers in the ring were \"the Cossack\" and the \"Russian Man-Eater\". During his wrestling career he would face other notable wrestlers of that era, such as Joe Stecher and Ed Lewis. Using his popularity as a wrestler, Linow entered the film industry during the 1920s, his first film being Cappy Ricks (1921). In his fifteen-year acting career he would appear in over forty films in supporting and bit parts. While appearing in films, Linow would continue his wrestling career, his final match would be in July 1931, under the pseudonym, Jack Leon, in which he would defeat Young Sandow. Linow would retire from films two years later, in 1935; his final film was The Black Room, starring Boris Karloff. On November 21, 1940, while in London, Linow would die of a heart attack."

  "text" : "Isaac Leib Goldberg (February 7, 1860 – September 14, 1935) was a Zionist leader and philanthropist in both Israel and Russia. An early member of the Hovevei Zion movement (1882) he also founded the Ohavei Zion society. Goldberg was a delegate to the First Zionist Congress and the founder of two Hebrew newspapers, Ha'aretz (Israel's oldest daily newspaper) and Ha'am. Isaac (Heb. Yitzchak) was born on February 7, 1860 in Šakiai, Congress Poland (present-day Lithuania) to Alexander Sander HaLevi Goldberg and Liba Segal, his brother was Boris Goldberg. In his early years, Goldberg studied at Kovno Yeshiva and settled in Vilnius, Lithuania. His wife was Rachel Pinnes and they had five children, Hannah Tolkowsky, Shulamit Hochfeld; Samuel Goldberg; Yehudit Klibanov, and Binyamin Zeev Goldberg. In 1903 the first plot of land for the Jewish National Fund was given as a gift by Goldberg for growing olives in Israel. In 1908 he purchased the first plot of land on Mount Scopus, Jerusalem for the future Hebrew University. Isaac Leib Goldberg also helped create the Geulah Company for private land acquisition and sale in Israel, and the Carmel Company for sale of Jewish wine. In 1919 he co-founded the newspaper Haaretz in Jerusalem. Upon his death on September 14, 1935 in Switzerland, Goldberg bequeathed one half of his estate to the Jewish National Fund for the promotion of Hebrew language and culture. This donation, known as the Isaac Leib and Rachel Goldberg Fund, amounted to roughly $30 million by today's standards. Goldberg was buried in Trumpeldor, Tel Aviv, Israel."

Just after completing her studies at the Milan Conservatory, she made her debut in 1822 at La Scala, as Emerico in the première of Mercadante's Adele ed Emerico. The opera obtained a good success and this facilitated the career of Isabella Fabbrica, which in the same year interpreted other premières of operas of Donizetti (Chiara e Serafina) and Mercadante (Amleto). After a few years spent mainly between Milan and Turin, she married, after dropping a possible union with Mercadante, the tenor Giovanni Battista Montresor, son of the contralto Adelaide Malanotte. After her debut in Rome in 1830, she spent some years in Portugal, where she obtained an extraordinary success. Later Fabbrica sang also in Madrid and Saint Petersburg, until 1850, when she ceased her activity. Isabella Fabbrica was very famous for her talents as an actress and for her powerful voice."

  "text" : "Ingti Kathar Songbijit is a militant leader who once led the secessionist faction of National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) in North-East India. Although he served as the leader of an organization that claims to represent Bodo people, Songbijit is not a Bodo himself. He was born in a Karbi family. He hails from the Chelaikhati village, which is located in the Biswanath Chariali sub-division of Sonitpur district, Assam. Kathar is a sub-clan (kurjon) of the Ingti clan, which enjoys a high status in the Karbi society; the traditional chief priests come from the Kathar kurjon. As a young man, Songbijit joined National Democratic Front of Bodoland, a militant group seeking secession from India, to establish a sovereign Bodoland. After a section of NDFB gave up the secessionist demand and agreed to stage talks with the government, NDFB split into two factions. Songbijit remained with the anti-talks faction NDFB(ATF), which was led by NDFB's founder Ranjan Daimary. In 2009, Songbijit was promoted to the post of \"army commander\" in NDFB(ATF). In early 2010s, after Ranjan Daimary was arrested, a section of his group, now called NDFB(R), agreed to engage in talks with the government. The faction opposed to the talks elected Songbijit as the \"Interim President\" of NDFB on 13-14 November 2012. The new faction led by Songbijit is termed as NDFB(S) by the media and the government (Songbijit himself refers to his group as simply NDFB). In 2014, NDFB(S) was believed to have around 270 cadres, and was led by a 9-member \"national council\". Its cadres were scattered across several camps located in Nagaland and Myanmar's Sagaing Region. In January 2014, the Assam Police included him in the list of 15 most wanted criminals, and declared a cash reward of ₹ 1 million for information leading to his arrest. NDFB(S) was accused by the government of carrying out the May and December 2014 attacks against Muslim migrants and Adivasi tribals respectively, resulting in deaths of over a hundred civilians. Songbijit's faction was known to be in touch with other secessionist militant groups, including ULFA and KLO. While ULFA seeks to establish a united sovereign Assam, KLO demands a sovereign Kamtapur for Koch people. Both these proposed states have territories overlapping with the proposed sovereign Bodoland. Songbijit justified his alliances with these groups claiming that Koch and Bodo people have common ethnic roots, and NDFB has more similarities than differences with ULFA. According to him, the civilians killed in NDFB attacks were either collateral damage, or those involved in anti-NDFB activities. In a 2013 interview, Songbijit stated that he would agree to talks, if the government agrees to hold a referendum on Bodoland independence. According to him, corruption and diversity in religion, caste and community will ultimately lead to balkanization of India \"into 600 pieces\". In 2015, Songbijit was deposed as the NDFB President, following differences between him and other top leaders."

  "text" : "Ibrahim Sharif (Arabic: إبراهيم الشريف‎‎) was Bey of Tunis from 1702 to 1705, during the period of crisis which brought an end to the Muradid dynasty and preceded the rise to power of Husayn I Bey. Lieutenant of the Muradid Beys of Tunis, Ibrahim was at various points Agha of the sipahis (commander of the cavalry of the Turkish militia) and Agha of the janissaries (commander of the rifleman) to the final Muradid princes. During a trip to Istanbul to recruit jannissaries, a new war was declared between Murad III Bey and the Dey of Algiers; the Ottoman court, no longer able to control Murad III, ordered Ibrahim to return to Tunisia and arrest him. At the outset of the military campaign, on the banks of the Wadi Zarka, Ibrahim struck Murad III with a blow from his blunderbuss, before killing him in the presence of his other lieutenants. On his return to Tunis Sharif assassinated all the remaining princes of the Muradid dynasty in order to seize power for himself - the two young sons of Muhammad al-Hafsi al-Muradi, second son of Hammouda Pacha Bey, along with Hussein Bey, the third son of Hammouda Pacha Bey and his own son who was only four years old. Proclaimed Bey by the janissary militia, he was the first Bey not to be a Muradid in over a century. He was also designated Pasha by the Ottomans, as a reward for bringing an end to hostilities and subsequently was elected Dey of Tunis by the Ottoman divan of Tunis. He promptly abolished the title and powers of the Dey. Although he had accumulated all the offices at the head of the Tunisian beylik, he did not manage to put an end to the revolts and agitation begun after the death of the last Muradids. After he was defeated by the Dey of Algiers near Kef on 8 July 1705, he was captured and taken to Algiers, which led to the establishment of the Husainid dynasty after his own Agha of the Sipahis, Al-Husayn I ibn Ali at-Turki seized power. On his return to Tunis on 10 July, he was proclaimed Bey of Tunis. Ibrahim, freed by the Dey of Algiers, attempted to retake Tunis in order to avenge himself and regain power, but he was assassinated on the way at the order of Husayn I Bey at Ghar El Melh. His tomb is located at the foot of the city's fort."
