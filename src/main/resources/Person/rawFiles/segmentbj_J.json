  "text" : "Joseph R. Koberling, Jr. (27 May 1900 – 8 June 1990) was a Hungarian-American architect. Born in Budapest, Hungary, he emigrated to the United States, first to San Francisco, then, in 1917, to Tulsa, Oklahoma where he was a student of noted art teacher, Adah Robinson. He was in the first graduation class of Tulsa Central High School. He was then educated at the Armour Institute (later part of Illinois Institute of Technology) in Chicago, Illinois. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture in 1925. He returned to Tulsa, where he began practicing. He received his Oklahoma license in architecture in 1929, which he maintained until his death. Although much of his work was done solo, he was a principal in three partnerships in Tulsa: \n*  Redlich & Koberling, 1929-1931 (F. W. Redlich) \n*  Fleming & Koberling 1933-1937 (Noble B, Fleming) \n*  Koberling & Brandborg, 1946-1956 (Lennart Brandborg) Even while he was working outside a partnership, Koberling collaborated with several other architects on notable projects.

She was also a teaching assistant for French conversation and composition courses at the college. Afterwards, she taught in secondary schools in Derbyshire and then Yorkshire. From 1920 to 1931, she lived in Paris, attending the École pratique des hautes études and the Sorbonne where she studied Old French and Old Occitan. She was able to attend classes taught by Alfred Jeanroy and Edmond Faral. In 1928, she translated Aldous Huxley's novel Crome Yellow into French as Jaune de Crome. In 1932, she translated Johan Huizinga's Herfsttijd der Middeleeuwen into French as Le déclin du Moyen Âge. That same year, she translated Huxley's Those Barren Leaves into French as Marina di Vezza; that translation was awarded the Académie française's Prix Langlois. In 1929 and 1930, Bastin published the two volumes of Recueil général des Isopets, a collection of fables from the Middle Ages. With Edmond Faral, she was editor for Onze Poèmes concernant la Croisade, par Rutebeuf, published in 1946, and for Œuvres complètes de Rutebeuf, which was released in two volumes in 1958 and 1960.

She became a key figure and expert in ethology – concentrating on the behavior of tropical animals, jumping spiders, praying mantises, butterflies and most importantly, fiddler crabs. Her lifelong research on fiddler crabs -- researching their morphology, systematics, biogeography and behavior -- was published in her 1975 seminal work Fiddler Crabs of the World."

  "text" : "Joop Alberda (born 25 October 1952 in Oosterwolde, Friesland) is a retired volleyball coach from the Netherlands In 1996, under his directions, the Dutch Men's National Team won the gold medal in Atlanta, Georgia by defeating Italy in the final (3-2). During his time as an active player he played on the highest national level as setter for the teams of Lycurgus and Donitas from the city of Groningen. He found that he had a knack for the training an coaching side of sport in general and Volleybal in particular.A major inspiration in this aspect was Doug Beal, whom he met in 1985.Beal had guided the US national men's team to Olympic gold in the previous year, and his strategic approach appealed greatly to Alberda: controlling every possible detail, leaving nothing to chance. In 1994 Alberda was appointed as headcoach of the Dutch national men's volleybal team which had already been under way to international fame.Two years later this led to the gold medal in the 1996 Olympics. Later the Dutch population elected this event as most important national sporting even of the twentieth century. In 1996 Alberda himself was elected as \"best volleybalcoach in the world\". In 1997 he filled the position of technical director of the NOC*NSF, the Dutch national Olympic Federation. Under his guidance the Dutch delegation in the 2000 Sydney Olympics managed to win a record number of 25 medals. At the end of 2004 he quit his position at NOC*NSF. In October 2014 he was inducted in the Volleyball Hall of Fame. Joop Alberda is father of two children and lives in the Dutch town of Vinkeveen."

  "text" : "James Lattimer is a nuclear astrophysicist who works on the dense nuclear matter equation of state and neutron stars. He is a Distinguished Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Stony Brook University. He is an American Physical Society Fellow (2001), and has received a Guggenheim (J.S.) Fellowship (1999), a Sloan (Alfred P.) Fellowship (1982), and the Fullam (Ernest F.) Award from Dudley Observatory (1985). In 2015, Lattimer was awarded the Hans Bethe Prize for \"outstanding theoretical work connecting observations of supernovae and neutron stars with neutrino emission and the equation of state of matter beyond nuclear density.\" Lattimer has made a number of fundamental contributions to the field ofnuclear astrophysics, with a particular focus on neutron stars. Oneof his biggest impacts  was modeling the birth of neutron stars fromsupernovae in 1986 with then-research assistant professor Adam Burrows. This came just six monthsbefore the closest supernova in modern history (SN 1987A, in theLMC). Their paper  predicted the signature of neutrinos fromsupernovae that was subsequently validated by neutrino observations,from SN 1987A on Feb. 23, 1987. In work that led to his PhD thesis, Lattimer and his advisor David N. Schramm firstargued that the mergers of neutron stars and black holes would result in the ejection of neutron-rich matter in sufficient quantities to explain the origin of r-process elements such as gold and platinum. Later, with collaborators, he demonstrated decompressing neutron-star matter from both neutron star-black hole and neutron star-neutron star mergers would form a natural r-process that would match observed patterns. More recently, Lattimer and collaborators suggested thatthe recently observed rapid cooling of the neutron star in theCassiopeia A supernova remnant is the first direct evidence for superfluidity and superconductivityin neutron star interiors."

  "text" : "Jules Sylvain (pseudonym for Axel Stig Hansson), (11 June 1900 in Stockholm, 29 October 1968 in Castiglione della Pescaia, Italy), was a Swedish composer, screenwriter and musician. Sylvain was born Stig Hansson to actor Axel Hansson and actress and pedagog Valborg Hansson. Sylcains started att 11 yeard-old at Lundsbergs boarding school but escaped the school after four years. He studied piano lessons at Musikaliska Akademien between 1918 and 1920 and then continued to study at Music high school in Weimar between 1920 and 1922. He got his first income in 1918 as a café pianist in Stockholm. After that he worked as a musician in Germany for a few years. At his home coming in 1923 he made a name for himself at Kristallsalongen with the melodi Det är den dagliga dosisen som gör'et. During 1925 until 1928 sylvain was employed as a chapel master for Karl Gerhard and composed a number of the singers songs. As soon as the sound-film became established Sylvain started composing film music the first melody was Säg det i toner 1929, he was also for several years a musical advisor for Svensk Filmindustri. Sylvain composed several operetes the most known one is Zorina which had its premiere at the Stockholmsoperan in 1943. Sylvain also re-worked the music for the opera \"Glada Änkan\" for its relaunch in 1931. It is not completely known as to why Stig Hansson transformed to Jules Sylvain sometime in the 1920s. One theory is that it was Ernst Rolf who thought that a successful composer could not have such a regular name as Stig Hansson. Another theory is that he looked in a lexicon and got his eyes on the French composer with the name Sylvain and then combined the first name of his youth favourite author Jules Verne. Another is that he admired the French composer Maurice Yvain, and because of that wanted a name that sounded similar."

  "text" : "Jenny Levine is an American librarian and digital strategist who has been a longtime evangelist for the adoption of emerging Internet technologies by public libraries, in particular blogging and RSS. Since 2006, she has been a member of the RSS Advisory Board, a group that publishes the RSS specification and helps developers with web syndication. For over a decade, she has used her Shifted Librarian blog to encourage librarians to start blogs so they can \"create an authentic voice for what has traditionally been a faceless, inhuman institution.\" One of the first librarians to publish a web site, which she began doing in 1995, her blog became so popular that she was once the top search result on Google for the term \"Jenny.\" Levine works as an internet strategist for the American Library Association (ALA) and has been with the association since 2006. She spearheaded the creation of the ALA's Games and Gaming Round Table, a committee devoted to exploring how computer games and game design can be incorporated into libraries. Before working for the ALA, she was the internet development specialist and strategist for the Chicago Suburban Library System, now part of the Reaching Across Illinois Library System. She was hired as the technology coordinator for Grande Prairie Public Library District in 1996. In 2003, she was named one of the library industry's \"Movers and Shakers\" of the year by Library Journal. The publication called her an \"information technology evangelist\" and observed, \"Whenever she sees new gadgets -- Bluetooth-equipped pens, or digital wi-fi cameras, or software that shows you how a web page displays on different kinds of platforms -- Levine immediately sees ways librarians can use them. ... She's made people outside our profession realize that librarians are cool.\" After graduating with a Master of Library and Information Science in 1992 from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and taking a job as a reference librarian, Levine fell into her role as an Internet evangelist by chance. She said in an interview, \"One day a patron asked for a recipe for Irish Soda Bread, and I couldn't find it in our collection. So I decided to try the CompuServe account I had just found out we had (that no one ever used) to fill the patron's need. Sure enough, there was a recipe I was able to print out for her.

Anderson, the actor, because their careers overlapped, and obviously the similarity in their names. Born on November 6, 1902, in his twenty-five year career, Anderson worked on almost 75 pictures. He began his career in film as an actor with a featured role in the silent era, in 1925's The Freshman, starring Harold Lloyd. After appearing in several silent films, with the advent of sound he moved behind the camera, where he was a perennial assistant director. He would spend almost his entire career with RKO Radio Pictures, from their inception in 1929 through 1949. As an assistant director he would work with such famous directors as George Archainbaud, William A. Wellman, Walter Lang, Garson Kanin, Dorothy Arzner, Leo McCarey, and Ida Lupino. Late in his career he would also work as a unit or production manager on several films, including the classic Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House in 1948. In 1950 he would become a freelance filmmaker, although he mostly worked with Lupino's independent production company, \"The Filmakers\", participating in nine of the twelve films they produced between 1949-54. His final film credit would be on the small screen, as the assistant director and production manager for the 1957 episode \"The Mothers\", on Lupino's television series, Mr. Adams & Eve. Anderson died on November 26, 1960 in Los Angeles, California."

She had been responsible for investigations into Soviet intelligence and subversion. She then joined the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), but when Kim Philby, later to be exposed as a double agent, became her boss he reduced her investigative work because he feared she might uncover his treachery. In his memoirs, he wrote, \"After Guy Liddell, Jane was perhaps the ablest professional intelligence officer ever employed by MI5\".

Bonehill has described himself as being \"a proud anti-Semite\". Bonehill's online activity has led to criminal charges being brought against him for harassment, antisemitic commentary and hoaxing, including a 2013 online hoax that led to the owners of a Leicester pub receiving death threats, and other false accusations which were punished with a suspended prison sentence. Bonehill was described as an \"internet troll\" by the prosecutor at a 2014 court hearing. He was arrested in June 2015 for inciting racial hatred against Jews, for which he was found guilty in December, receiving a jail sentence of three years and four months."

He played as Jim Jacoby but he wrote books as James and for many years co-wrote a syndicated bridge column with his father as \"Jacoby on Bridge\" by Oswald and James Jacoby. (He wrote a re-branded newspaper bridge column after his father's death.) He won 16 \"national\" (ACBL) championships, first at age 22 in 1955, and he was the most successful ACBL tournament player (masterpoints leader) during 1988. Jacoby may have inherited talent and interest in games, not only from his legendary father Oswald Jacoby. He and his mother Mary Zita Jacoby co-wrote The New York Times Book of Backgammon (1973). LCCN 73-79915 Jacoby graduated from the University of Notre Dame. He was a long-time resident of Texas and an original, 1968 member of the professional bridge team formed by Texas businessman Ira Corn, variously known as the Aces, Dallas Aces, and Texas Aces. Jacoby was a resident of Richardson, Texas, when he died of cancer in a Dallas hospital at age 58. He was survived by his wife Judy, his son Jim Jacoby, Jr., and his brother Jon. In teams-of-four competition Jacoby was a member of four world champions. The Aces won the Bermuda Bowl both in 1970 as U.S. representative and in 1971 as defending champion. United States won the 8th quadrennial World Team Olympiad in 1988 (its first win in the open flight, in a field of 56 national teams). Jacoby also led the winning mixed team in 1972 as playing captain. At pairs Jacoby won world silver medals in the 1966 Open Pairs with Dr. John Fisher and in the 1978 Mixed Pairs with Heitie Noland (quadrennial events in non-Olympic even years). Jacoby was inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 1997."

Around the same time, she began to reduce contact with friends and family. She died in her bedsit around December 2003 with neither family, friends, co-workers, nor neighbours taking notice. Her remains were discovered on January 25, 2006, with the cause of death believed to be either an asthma attack or complications from a recent peptic ulcer. Her life and death were the topic of Dreams of a Life, a 2011 drama-documentary film. The film and Vincent's life inspired the album Hand. Cannot. Erase. by musician Steven Wilson."

His last film was 1944's Gunsmoke Mesa. Newill was known mostly for his western roles, having been one-third of the Texas Rangers in the Texas Rangers series of B-movies. Of the 22-film series, Newill co-starred in the first 14, along with co-stars Dave O'Brien and Guy Wilkerson. He played Texas Ranger Jim Steele. In some of his westerns, he's also credited with co-writing some of the film songs. With his somewhat operatic voice, he sang with the Los Angeles Light Opera Company."

  "text" : "James Poovey (c.1769–unknown) was an 18th-century Philadelphian enslaved from birth who achieved manumission through non-violent disobedience. In 1780, the Pennsylvania legislature ratified An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery which effectively abolished the importation of future slaves to Pennsylvania and granted children born into slavery after its enactment freedom at the age of twenty-eight years. Poovey, born roughly eleven years prior to the institution of this law, was precluded from claiming freedom under the act. By the age of about thirty-three years, Poovey had become literate and was actively reading the New Testament of the Holy Bible. Based upon his interpretation of verses such as Matthew 7:12, Poovey arrived at the conclusion that allowing one man to enslave another was anathema to the \"do unto others\" charge of the bible. In an attempt to gain freedom, Poovey made propositions for manumission to his owner Mr. Coates, a blacksmith, in the Southwark District of Philadelphia. Initially, Poovey offered Coates seven years faithful service, only to be declined. He then offered to purchase his freedom from Coates by earning wages at sea; Coates rejected this also. After these failed negotiations, Poovey's convictions of freedom grew deeper and he promised to make no further overtures to Coates saying, \"You will get nothing by trying to keep me in slavery, for I am determined to be free. I shall never make you another offer.\" Soon after this stern declaration, Poovey chose to simply walk away from his oppressor in Southwark. Coates responded immediately by applying for an arrest warrant. Within a few days, Poovey was captured and sentenced to prison for thirty days, a common punishment for runaway slaves. While in prison, Coates visited Poovey to ask him to recant and return to bondage. Poovey flatly refused resulting in an additional thirty days of incarceration. Coates appeared yet again to speak with Poovey, this time offering him a new suit and Methodist hat for his voluntary return. Poovey proudly declined the offer saying, \"keep them for your self [..] I will never serve you nor any man as a slave again.\" After this confrontation, Coates weighed his options about Poovey concluding that he could neither keep him nor sell him due to Pennsylvania's prohibitive slave trafficking laws. After just over two months of suffering in jail, Poovey walked away a free man as Coates in effect defaulted by choosing to pursue him no further. James Poovey had achieved freedom through non-violent disobedience."

  "text" : "John Travlos (Greek: Iωάννης Tραυλóς, Iōannēs Travlos; Rostov-on-Don 1908 – Athens, October 28, 1985) was a Greek architect, architectural historian, and archaeologist known especially for his work at Athens in the agora of the ancient city. He is the architect that restored the Stoa of Attalos in Athens (1952-1956). Travlos, although born in Russia, was the son of Greeks from Naxos. His family relocated to Athens in 1912, when Travlos was four. He studied there at the National Technical University of Athens in the School of Architecture, receiving his degree in 1931 and his doctorate in 1955. Anastasios Orlandos was an important influence on Travlos. He became the architect of the Athenian Agora excavations carried out by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in 1935 and was architect of the school from 1940 until 1973. He produced many influential phase plans and drawings of Athens' history from ca. 3500 BC up to contemporary times. He also did important work at the Eleusinion sanctuary of Demeter in Athens, and also at the sanctuary of Demeter in Eleusis, in collaboration with the excavations conducted by Greek archaeologist George E. Mylonas. He conducted fieldwork around Greece, including at Eleusis, Isthmia, Corinth, Eretria, and Megara and also carried out further work at Olynthus and Vergina in northern Greece, as well as in Cyprus. Among his major works, his 1960 treatise on the history of the urban development of Athens and his pictorial dictionary of Athens are the most influential."

  "text" : "John Holland (born 1944) is an American composer, author, performer, and recording artist. He is Professor Emeritus in the Studio for Interrelated Media at Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston. Holland headed the Electronic Music Studio and taught music and performance classes before he retired from teaching in 2009. Holland's music has been performed largely in Boston and New York. He has produced a number of recordings, and has published musical scores for most solo instruments (with and without digital modification), chamber music, songs, music for orchestra, concertos, operas. For a number of years Holland has produced a ‘live’ music series in Boston, New Music at the Pozen Center, that mixes contemporary and electronic music with innovative performative features. In addition he is founder and producer of The Chocolate Ear online music series. Holland founded the American Soundgroup in 1974, which was in residence at Massachusetts College of Art and Design from 1975 to 1985. In 1986 he founded and directed the Text-Sound Chorus in Boston. John Holland is a pioneer of the modern intersection between art and science. In the early 1980s Holland co-founded Nature and Inquiry, an artists group that met weekly to discuss ideas in art and science. The group has presented work at the MIT Media Lab, the Harvard Smithsonian Observatory, Habitat Institute, Copley Society of Art, and Axiom Gallery. He also taught a class for three decades that introduced artists to leading-edge ideas in science. (see ) Holland has produced many online recordings, including Symbiotica - A Cross-Cultural Mixup Vols. 1 and 2., The Continents, Listen, and The Musical Landscape. The Adam and Eve Diaries, A Web Opera based on Mark Twain’s The Diaries of Adam and Eve is perhaps the first opera of its kind to be composed for the Web. In many of these recordings, there are original complementary texts that precede various musical pieces and that were intended to be read aloud in a ‘live’ setting. The texts complement the music in ways that may change the way we hear the music. Writings, including The Chicken and the Egg - A Collection of writings on Nature, Science, and Art, Curious: An Introduction to Big Ideas in Nature, Science, and Art, If A Tree Falls In The Forest: Simple Descriptions of Complex Phenomena, Quantum Wave Theory: A Model of Unity in Nature, and Ten By Ten: Artificial Intelligence Models Accompanied by True or False Statements have been designed specifically as online artworks. Published books include: The Nature of Music for the Performing Musician, Time, Sound Waves and Their Properties in the Surrounding Media, and Studies on the Human Ear. A book on the perception of music, 'The Musical Brain', is in preparation. Holland has created performance texts designed to be read aloud, including Phenomena: Simple Descriptions of Complex Phenomena, Complete Short Texts for Speaking Voice, Strategies for Survival (with Complementary Music), and Facts of Life (with Complementary Music), all of which contain subjects related to nature, science and art. In 1997 Holland produced the first comprehensive full color poster-size Acoustic Wave Spectrum. It was later presented at the MIT Media Lab and in 2007 producer and composer DJ Spooky attached it to his audio CD companion to Sound Unbound. John Schaefer, host of New Sounds on WNYC Radio in New York cited Holland’s Natural Phenomena as “one of the notable CD’s of 2005.”Richard Perry, music critic, writes “Mr. Holland’s music has a compelling, insistent fascination…” Tia Kimberk says “John Holland’s music is often based on extra-musical ideas related to science and nature. Listening to the music informs us about ourselves and our larger context in the world.” In 1982 Holland was interviewed on National Public Radio for his recording of Music for a Small Planet in Three Parts. The composer's scores and texts are published by American Sound Press. All of Holland’s online music recordings and writing projects are free, and whenever possible presented without advertisement."

Joseph Glickauf was hired by Arthur Andersen Co. immediately after serving in the US Navy and was tasked with initiating the use of the freshly invented computer for his employer. Glickauf became familiar with the capabilities of the UNIVAC and immediately saw the far-reaching implications of computers for business. To demonstrate the computer to Arthur Andersen’s employees he built the Arthur Andersen Demonstration Computer known as “Glickiac”. The company management was quick to see the potential and made resources available for future development. In 1953 General Electric Appliance Park hired Arthur Andersen to automate GE’s payroll. Glickauf lead the effort and recommended GE the installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer. The project was initially a failure but it started what is now known as the “computer consulting”."

  "text" : "Jacob Cress (born 1944, Norton, Virginia, United States), better known as Jake Cress, is a furniture maker in Fincastle, Virginia who is known for his interpretations of classical 18th century furniture. He considers himself to be a cabinet maker and not an artist. He also builds normal classical furniture, miniature furniture, and carves boxes, as well as decorative pieces. He also restores furniture. Additionally, he builds more modern pieces like country tables and desks. Cress works with mahogany, walnut, and cherry woods. His animated works include \"The Decorator,\" \"Alladin's Lamp,\" \"Hickory Dickory Dock Clock,\" \"Self-Portrait,\" and \"Clock Face.\"  Cress crafts each piece of furniture by hand in his shop without sketching the furniture before he begins working on it. Jake Cress graduated from JI Burton High School, where he failed woodworking. He then joined the Navy in 1963 and attended Columbia School of Broadcasting in New York while he served. When he left the Navy, he worked for a radio station in Virginia. He moved to New York and acted in off-Broadway productions. He then returned to Virginia, where he opened up a cabinet-making business with his brother Joe in 1974 in Abingdon. He continued to act in community theater while he worked with his brother for several years. Cress married Phebe Fullerton and the couple eventually moved to Fincastle, Virginia, where Cress' shop currently is. Cress left his business with his brother and began creating his own furniture and opened his own shop. Cress was inspired by furniture he found in different antique shops. Cress continued his acting career in local theaters and he played the marshall in the 1993 movie \"Sommersby.\" The first piece of animated furniture that Cress created was \"Crippled Table,\" named by a friend of Cress' who had a leg damaged by childhood Polio. The table has one leg replaced by a carved crutch. His other pieces include a clock based on the \"Hickory Dock,\" nursery rhyme, called the \"Hickory Dickory Dock Clock,\" one of which was sold through Sotheby's and another of which is in the Indianapolis Children's Museum. \"How to Build Furniture,\" a table with one shorter leg resting on a book and \"Peel Here,\" a table that appears to peel back revealing a checkerboard, are other works. Cress has also animated other chairs through his \"Self Portrait,\" chairs: chairs that are animated and appear to be building themselves. Cress' chair \"Oops!\" is the most famous of his animated furniture and the ninth one Cress created was displayed in the Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian Museum and is now in the museum's permanent American Furniture collection. \"Oops!\", made in 1991 is featured in the permanent collection of Yale. \"Oops!\" is a Chippendale-style chair that is animated, including legs that have claws holding the traditional balls at the bottom of the chair in place. One of the claws has lost its ball, leading to the name \"Oops!\". Other features of the chair include eyes and a slanted chair frame and legs. Cress made 10 of the \"Oops!\" chairs, all but one of which have been sold. Cress has been featured in The Washington Post and American Art Magazine and is featured in the Virginia tourism site under \"The Arts. \" In 2011, Cress had an exhibition featuring his work in Abingdon, Virginia at the William King Museum. The exhibition was titled \"Mischief-Making: Contemporary Craftsman Jake Cress,\" and included a carving workshop. Cress collaborated with painter Mark Young to create \"The Decorator,\" a realist oil painting that extends outwards physically through hand crafted furniture. From the painting, a chair's arm, created by Jake Cress, reaches out and places a flower into a vase that rests on a table built by Cress. The table stands under the painting. The chairs featured in the painting are Cress' animated chairs. \"The Decorator\" was featured at the King William Museum. Cress' home, which includes his furniture gallery and he and his wife's bed and breakfast, is furnished with his furniture, some of which is for sale. Cress continues to work in his shop in Fincastle, Virginia. He is no longer an actor in the community."

In April 1939, Crouch was engaged to Barbara Hives. He served his apprenticeship at the yard of Stanley Wooton in Epsom. By 1933, he was successfully competing and accumulated 31 wins by 1936. During October that year it was reported he was to be retained as the king's jockey after Joe Childs retired. In the 1937 Epsom Derby he piloted the horse, Sandsprite, bred by Florence Nagle at odds of 100–1, to second place behind Mid-day Sun, owned by Mrs Lettice Miller, the first woman owner ever to win the Derby. Crouch died when the de Havilland Dragon Rapide light aircraft he was a passenger in crashed on 20 June 1939. The aircraft had been travelling from Heston to Gosforth Park where Crouch was due to ride the king's horse Mouzelle in the Seaton Delaval Stakes; the horse was withdrawn as a mark of respect."

  "text" : "James Turnbull was the first steamboat captain on the Colorado River. His voyages supplying the Army at Fort Yuma demonstrated that the river was navigable by steamboats. After obtaining a contract to supply the fort, James Turnbull sailed with supplies and the disassembled Uncle Sam, a 65-foot long side-wheel paddle steamer tug, to the Colorado River Delta, in the schooner Capacity. There he had the vessel re-assembled at a landing in the delta in two months. Turnbull then successfully brought supplies up the Colorado River 120 miles in 15 days from the Colorado River Delta to Fort Yuma, where he arrived December 3, 1852. He then took some passengers from the fort up the river for a few miles as a celebration of the success before returning to bring up more supplies. Equipped with only a 20 horsepower engine, the Uncle Sam could only carry 35 tons of supplies, It made trips for four more months up and down the river to finish carrying the supplies from the Capacity to the fort reducing its time for a round trip to 12 days. Negligence caused it to sink at its dock below Fort Yuma, and was then washed away before it could be raised, in the spring flood of May 1853. Turnbull who meanwhile had returned to the Delta from San Francisco with another cargo and a more powerful engine for the Uncle Sam. Finding it lost he returned for a new hull, while the army sent wagons to recover the cargo from the delta. However Turnbull disappeared from San Francisco, leaving creditors unpaid. Turnbull later turned up in Mazatlan, Mexico, where he ran a small steamboat for many years and attempted to promote the building of a canal. However Turnbull had shown the worth of steamboats to solve Fort Yuma's supply problem and to successfully navigate the Colorado River, an example that was soon followed by George Alonzo Johnson."

He later returned to Scotland and worked as an architect for a spell before joining the Assessor of Railways and Canals in Edinburgh. Around 1891 he joined Midlothian County Council as Assistant County Surveyor. On the tragic accidental death of the County Surveyor Thomas Forbes in 1896 Robb took over his role as Suburban Road Surveyor and the following year was appointed County Surveyor from a field of 50 applicants, on a salary of £450pa. The Roads Office grew in importance with the rapid rise of the motor car and Robb led an office with four Road Surveyors for the County areas (Suburban, Calder, Gala Water and Lasswade). His younger brother David Haig Robb worked as a surveyor in his department and from 1905 another brother Andrew (1869-1926) joined his department as Chief Clerk or Assistant County Surveyor.Yet another brother, James, served as a Road Surveyor for Edinburgh Council. Robb brought many new innovations in road management to Midlothian Council, which was seen as the foremost roads authority in Scotland, not least because it was the first to employ a County Surveyor with all roads in the County controlled from a single office, ensuring equitable allocation of resources. In 1902 he was responsible for a Road map of the County published by W&AK Johnston.Robb widened, reconstructed and maintained roads in the County and also repaired and rebuilt bridges. Much of his work involved obtaining road metal from Council-owned or leased quarries such as Kaimes, Blackford, Cortleferry and Barnton. In 1907 he treated the members of the County Road Surveyors Association of Scotland to a 'monster blast' that dislodged 8000 tonnes of rock at Kaimes. He was particularly influential in providing housing for roadmen in the County. In 1900 he had argued that providing decent homes for roadmen would cut down on travel-to-work times and would keep good men in the Council's employ. The Council agreed and from 1901 began building housing throughout the County area. These simple single and semi-detached dwellings were designed by Robb whose architectural background came in useful. They were normally built at road intersections or near Council quarries. Several remain including a semi-detached dwelling in Silverburn that retains its County Roadman sign, with single examples at old Craighall, Gourlaw and Kirknewton and a special two-storey design in the Arts & Crafts style at Spylaw Road in Colinton. All utilised harled brick walls with red engineering brick quoin detailing. This provision was followed thereafter by other Councils. His last years were dominated by a Council proposal to erect a ferro-concrete bridge over the Water of Leith and Caledonian Railway at Colinton. Robb's design, had it been built, would have been the largest concrete road bridge in Scotland, and one of the largest in the UK. However, in this endeavour he was strenuously opposed by a group of influential Colinton residents led by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson, Scotland's premier architect, and eventually the bridge was only widened. In his professional life he was a leading member of the East of Scotland Engineering Association, serving as an early Hon. Secretary and Vice President. He was also President of the County Road Surveyors Association of Scotland and served as a delegate in their 1904 trip to France. He returned five years later as a delegate to the first International Road Congress held in Paris in 1909. In January 1912 he was appointed an Affiliate of the Institution of Civil Engineers and served on their Scottish Roads Committee. In his spare time he served in the Volunteers becoming Sergeant-Instructor of Musketry for the Lothian and Berwickshire Yeomanry. He was a fine rifle shot, making numerous appearances at the NRA competitions at Bisley. He died on 15th January 1913 at Craiglockhart Hydropathic. He left around £1000, his gold watch, seal and drawing equipment to his brother Andrew. Andrew's second son, Graeme Lambert Robb (1906-58) would also serve, early in his career, as a Road Surveyor for Midlothian whilst his brother George Clark Robb (1903-80) became an architect."

Born 17 May 1732 in Görlitz, Gehler studied medicine from 1751 to 1758 at the University of Leipzig, where he was a pupil of physician and botanist Christian Gottlieb Ludwig. While a student at Leipzig, he furthered his interest in natural sciences, publishing the mineralogical treatise, De characteribus fossilium externis (1757), as a result. Following graduation, he continued his education by studying mineralogy in Freiberg and obstetrics in Strasbourg as a student of Johann Jakob Fried (1689–1769). After his return to Leipzig, he served as a lecturer in mineralogy, and in the meantime, maintained a successful medical practice, of which, he specialized in midwifery. In 1763 he was named an associate professor of botany at the university. Later on at Leipzig, he successively held professorships in physiology (1773–1781), anatomy and surgery (1781–1784), pathology (1784–1789) and therapy (1789–1796). From 1789 to 1796, he served as dean of the medical faculty. He was a member of the Ökonomischen Gesellschaft."

The South Carolina unified court system was created while he served on the high court. After retiring, he served as a special trial court judge. In 1985, he created controversy by saying \"damn niggers\" from the bench into a microphone that he may have thought was turned off. He had been referring to a group of black protestors who were displeased about the conviction of a black man for the killing of a white man in Pendleton, South Carolina. The York County Justice Center was named in his honor over the objections of the NAACP."

  "text" : "John Chapin Mosher (June 2, 1892 – September 3, 1942) was an American short story writer as well as the first regularly assigned film critic for The New Yorker, a position he held from 1928 to 1942. Mosher was born in Ogdensburg, New York and graduated from Williams College in Massachusetts in 1914. Moving to New York City in 1915, he joined the editorial staff of the general interest magazine Every Week and became involved in the Greenwich Village theater community, writing the one-act comedy plays Sauce for the Emperor and Bored, which were staged by the Provincetown Players in 1916–17. During the First World War Mosher served in the shell shock ward of a U.S. Medical Corps hospital in Portsmouth, England. After the war, Mosher traveled around Europe and wrote various freelance articles for magazines before becoming an English instructor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. In 1926 he joined the staff of The New Yorker, initially contributing short stories. In the earliest historical chronicle of the magazine published in 1951, Mosher was credited as \"a pioneer of the New Yorker short story.\" He became the magazine's resident film critic starting with the September 22, 1928 issue. According to The New York Times, Mosher's writings \"had a personal note and were noteworthy for their humor and bristling style\", while The New Yorker stated he \"wrote with restraint and was never dull.\" In addition to writing, Mosher read the magazine's unsolicited manuscripts. In 1940, a compilation of Mosher's New Yorker fiction was published in a book titled Celibate at Twilight and Other Stories. A number of these stories, featuring a wealthy, middle-aged bachelor named Mr. Opal, capture 1930s community life on Fire Island, where Mosher was among the earliest gay property owners in Cherry Grove. Mosher's final New Yorker column ran in the June 20, 1942 issue; he died less than three months later in New York City of heart disease at the age of 50. The magazine eulogized him as \"witty, perceptive, and influenced by a deep and tolerant knowledge of the world\" and \"one of the most delightful companions we have ever known.\""

Carter's life and career were cut short when he died of heatstroke while on an Italian aid mission during World War One. Carter was the son of Peter and Marie Louise Carter. He was educated at New York University (1889-1890), at Princeton University (A.B. 1893), and at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg (Ph.D. 1898). At Halle he studied with Georg Wissowa and Carl Robert. He was Professor of Latin at Princeton from 1902. In 1904 he moved to Rome to join the faculty of the American School of Classical Studies, becoming director in 1907. When the American School of Classical Studies merged with the American Academy in Rome in 1911, Carter continued on as a faculty member and became the AAR director in 1912, following the death of Francis Davis Millet aboard the Titanic. Carter's scholarship focused on Roman religion and topography. He collaborated with Christian Hülsen on topographical studies of the Forum Romanum and produced his own work on the scholarship of Roman religion. Carter was married to Kate Freeman Carter (March 5, 1870, in Peekskill, New York, - September 8, 1948, at Clinique Val-Mont, Glion, Montreux, Switzerland) who was the daughter of the Reverend John and Mary Freeman. Carter was awarded the Order of the Crown of Italy by King Victor Emmanuel III. He is buried in the Protestant Cemetery of Rome, Italy."

Legislators were exempt from the draft during World War II, but he resigned in midterm to enter the military. Lewis served for sixteen years as a trial court judge before he was elected as an associate justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court on February 21, 1961. He was elected chief justice on January 21, 1975 to fill the unexpired term of Joseph Rodney Moss; was sworn in on August 14, 1975; and served until his retirement in 1984.

  "text" : "Jerry Dreva (1945–1997) was an artist, writer, performer, activist and teacher from South Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was a principal proponent of “mail-art.\" His efforts were concentrated in the areas of self-documentation and performance, and characterized by a sense of whimsy and irreverence. He often employed subterfuge and a wry sense of humor in order to carry out these aims. His performances often included the use of media and in particular the printed word. In one of his most famous performances he would sneak out at night and spray paint public buildings in South Milwaukee. The next morning, in his role as a reporter for the local South Milwaukee weekly, the Voice-Journal, he would report glowingly on these graffiti events sometimes signed by the “Art Gangster” thus creating a counter-cultural figure and simultaneously influencing the way in which that figure was portrayed in the media. It was a ruse that lasted several years. Active in the local civil rights and anti-war movements in the late 1960s, he became increasingly devoted to the cause of gay rights on the local and national level. He was a founding member (together with Robert J. Lambert) of Les Petite Bon Bons, a flamboyantly attired musical group that never played a single concert. In fact, they never so much as picked up an instrument. Instead they dressed as glitter rock musicians of the era (1970’s) and were frequently featured in newspapers and magazines as Les Petite Bon Bons. As a mail artist he corresponded with individuals well known for their work in this field including On Kawara, Ray Johnson, Ben Vautier, Coum Transmissions, General Idea and members of Asco. His work was included in countless mail art exhibits both nationally and internationally, including Extended Sensibilities: Homosexual Presence in Contemporary Art at the New Museum in New York in 1982. During the 1980s Dreva became increasingly interested Latin America, learning Spanish and spending considerable time in Guatemala, El Salvador and other Central and South American countries, studying revolutionary movements. He was a supporter of the Shining Path in Peru, but adamant in insisting that gay rights be included in their agenda. He died of a heart attack at his home in Milwaukee at the age of fifty-two. More recently his work has attracted the attention of a growing number of writers and curators and has been featured in catalogs and exhibitions from the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA) and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)."

Appointed bishop of Blois (22 November 2014) and installed there on 11 January 2015, he served in the Issy-lès-Moulineaux seminary near Paris, and as Curé of Ste. Jeanne de Chantal church in the XVIe Arrondissement of Paris before being appointed auxiliary bishop in Lyons (with the title of Ressiana). Hitherto best known as a theologian, his doctoral thesis explored the doctrine of divine omnipotence in patristic thought prior to the Council of Nicaea (325) and its publication in 2009 as 'Pantocrator' was well received. According to French and Italian newspaper reports his appointment as bishop of Metz in the Concordat zone of Alsace-Moselle in eastern France in 2013 appears to have been overruled by the French Minister of Interior. A question on this point was asked in the French parliament on 22 October 2013 In April 2015 bishop Batut criticized President Hollande's reference to 'Egyptian citizens (ressortissants égyptiens) massacred in Libya', a euphemism followed abundantly in French official and journalistic sources and intended to avoid reference to Christians being killed but which has now been abandoned by the French élite."

In 1978 she became the head of the Communist Youth League organization in the provincial capital Taiyuan, before being elevated to head the provincial CYL organization in 1985 at the age of 33. She then served as the Deputy Party Secretary of Xinzhou, the Deputy Party Secretary of Taiyuan, and then the Party Secretary of Shuozhou, the highest office in the city. By 2000, Jin took on the post of Secretary of the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, heading anti-graft work in the province, and was elevated to the party's provincial Standing Committee, in practice the top ruling council of Shanxi. In 2005 she became the President of the Shanxi Provincial Party School. Jin became the Deputy Party Secretary of Shanxi province in October 2006, and the Chairwoman of the provincial Political Consultative Conference, a largely ceremonial post that nonetheless made her a full provincial-ministerial level official. In October 2008, Jin died in a car accident while travelling on the expressway between Xinzhou and Taiyuan. She was travelling back from Xinzhou after visiting on government business. She was 56 years old. In her official obituary, she was said to have \"died while on the job.\" Jin was an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a member of the 16th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. She had one son."

In the battle for the bridge over the Rhine, he led an understrength platoon of four of the newest heavy-duty T26E3 M16 Pershing tanks. Under his leadership, his unit played an instrumental role in capturing the last intact bridge across the Rhine, the only one of 22 road and 25 railroad bridges across the Rhine that the Germans had not yet blown up. While serving with the 14th Tank Battalion, he had previously been awarded the Silver Star for actions on 17 December 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge near Steinbruck, Belgium. When his lead tank was disabled by a German Panzerfaust round, he remained with the tank and led his platoon in destroying the enemy who had attacked his tank. He then dismounted from the tank and led his crew and the remaining tanks \"under continuous enemy fire with such stunning effect of enemy demoralization that 87 prisoners were taken.\""

The Statehouse was unable to choose a successor for the new term to start in August 1921 despite thirty-nine ballots over several weeks; on March 4, 1921, the General Assembly agreed to delay the selection of a new justice until the 1922 term, leaving the position unfilled for several months. When the legislature reconvened in January 1922, Marion was finally elected on the forty-seventh ballot. The drawn-out balloting was merely to fill the unexpired term of Justice Gage; the Statehouse then, on January 18, 1922, quickly elected Marion to not just finish the unexpired term but to fill a complete term thereafter. he left the court to take a position in Charlotte, North Carolina working for Duke Power. He was sworn in on January 19, 1922. He is buried at the Evergreen Cemetery in Chester, South Carolina."

  "text" : "Julia Gina Plahte Vance (born 13 July 1968) is a Norwegian sculptor. Having started working in stone in 1992, she now shares her time between working in Oslo and Johansen Monumenthuggeri in Norway and the internationally famous marble-carving studio Studio Sem in the sculpture town of Pietrasanta in Tuscany, Italy. Julia Vance's carved stone sculptures seem to be bending stone into tightly stretched surfaces with precisely defined curves and edges. Sculptures based on words and letter shapes, as classical form with conceptual expression. Her first solo-show with sculpture in Norway took place in Bærum Kunstforening in the spring of 2014. Showing over 30 sculptures in Italian marble, and also work in granite, alabaster, glass and bronze, she received a lot of publicity, amongst others on NRK (Norwegian National TV) and by Aftenposten's art-critic Kjetil Røed. Julia Vance has several times exhibited her sculptures in front of the Norwegian Parliament in Oslo. And the sculpture-group 'WE-ME, expression #5' in front of the main trainstation of Oslo during 2013, leading to the Council of Oslo buying them and placing them in the new Rommensletta Sculpturepark. Her sculptures have been acquired by the Councils of Oslo, and of Bærum, Larvik and Os. Her work is also in the collections of larger institutions like The Central Bank of Norway, on the Norwegian coast-liner 'Trollfjord', the Het Depot Gallery (Holland) and with private collectors like John B. Hightower and Alyce Faye. Curator at the National Museum of Norway put Julia Vance's sculptures in the inheritance of Åse Texmon Rygh, Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, but also put her work in context with contemporary artists like Jenny Holtzer. Former director of MoMa in New York, John B. Hightower, said “Julia Vance’s sculpture adds another distinctive flair by transforming traditional calligraphy into blocks and forms more familiar to Isamu Noguchi and Jean Arp.” Vance's sculptures have been exhibited in Norway, England, Russia, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Holland and in the United Arab Emirates (by invitation). She has taught and lectured in Norway, England and Belgium and is a member of the Norwegian Sculpture Organisation (NBF, and board-member 2005-2007), of the Royal British Society of Sculptors (RBS) and of the Coin Design Advisory Committee of Norway's Central Bank."

  "text" : "Jennifer Cody Epstein is the internationally best-selling author of The Painter from Shanghai, and the novel The Gods of Heavenly Punishment. She resides in New York City and lives with her husband and daughters. She has a Master of Fine Arts degree, a Masters in International relations and a bachelor's degree in Asian Studies and English. Aside from her work as a novelist, she has written for NBC, HBO and The Wall Street Journal, The Asian Wall Street Journal, The Nation (Thailand), Self, and Mademoiselle magazines. Epstein has also worked in Tokyo and Kyoto in Japan, where she lived for five years as a student and a teacher, and in Hong Kong and Bangkok. She has taught at Columbia University in the United States, and internationally at Doshisha University in Kyoto, Japan. Epstein’s debut novel, The Painter from Shanghai, is the fictional autobiography of Pan Yuliang who lived from 1895 to 1977. She was a female Chinese painter who was revolutionary in bringing Western painting styles to China. From start to finish, in took Epstein ten years to complete the novel. The real Pan Yuliang’s life is shrouded in uncertainty and obscurity. So “this is not a factual account of Pan Yuliang’s life, [it is] a re-imagining.” Epstein did much research, helping her to accurately portray the characters and the period. Her second novel, The Gods of Heavenly Punishment, is a fictional work about Japan and the life of young Yoshi Kobayashi during World War II. In the book, Yoshi has to struggle with the destruction of her city, life, love and secrets. This novel was a work of fiction that allowed Epstein to return to her fascination with Japan, where she had been first an exchange student, then a journalist."

  "text" : "James Allen Vann III (20 November 1939–4 May 1986) was an American historian, specializing in German history of the early modern period. He was a professor of History at Emory University. Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he graduated from Washington and Lee University, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1961. He served two years in the army, then entered Harvard University, where he received the Doctorate of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in 1970. He subsequently joined the faculty of the University of Michigan. He served on the faculty of the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris from 1983–84. Following his assignment there, he joined the faculty at Emory University in Atlanta. His 1975 work, The Swabian Kreis: Institutional Growth in the Holy Roman Empire, 1648-1715, established Vann among a group of young scholars whose new vision of the historical Holy Roman Empire challenged classical notions of that institution's viability and functionality. In his study of Württemberg, he rejected traditional ideas of state building as a conscious social determinism, but instead explained the evolution of a German state in terms of relations between and among the dukes and the courtiers, privy councilors and the general representative body of the Landtag. Since 1985, the James Allen Vann Seminar, continued in his honor, offers an informal venue for scholars, graduate students, and other interested parties from the Atlanta area to discuss scholarly papers on topics concerning pre-modern European history and the relations between early modern Europe and the rest of the world."

  "text" : "John Paul Capps (born April 17, 1934) is one of the longest-serving members of the state legislature in Arkansas. Capps began his career in the late 1950s as a news anchor for KTHV, the CBS affiliate in Little Rock, Arkansas. He then moved to radio, working as a news announcer, DJ, and station manager at KWCB in Searcy, Arkansas. He later started his own radio stations, KAPZ and KKSY. In November 1962, Capps was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives as a Democrat at the age of 28, making him one of the youngest representatives at that time. In 1982, he was elected Speaker of the House. In 1998, after 36 years of legislative service, he left the House due to term limits, which had recently been enacted by Arkansas voters. In 2002, Capps re-entered politics, running for the Arkansas State Senate, District 29 (parts of White, Pulaski, and Faulkner counties) and was elected, subsequently winning re-election in 2006. While in the legislature, he served on a number of committees, including the Legislative Council; Rules and Regulations; Joint Audit; and Revenue and Taxation. He also chaired several committees: Transportation, Technology, and Legislative Affairs; Advanced Communications and Information Technology; Economic and Taxation Policy; and the Blue Ribbon Committee on Highway Finance. Capps worked on a number of initiatives, including a reform of the General Improvement Fund, which had previously encouraged legislators to treat the fund as a pork barrel. In 2005, the Arkansas Sierra Club called Capps a \"hero for Arkansas' future\" because his environmental voting record was adjudged the best in the Senate. In 2007, Capps sponsored legislation to create a non-profit organization, Connect Arkansas, intended to expand the state's broadband coverage for health, education, and other economic development projects. As in 1998, he left the legislature in 2010 due to term limits; after his retirement, Capps said that he believed one of his most important achievements was sponsoring legislation to fund the expansion of the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences into a world-class medical center."

Due to his dark skin color, he struggled against racist legislation that prohibited Valdes from continuing his primary education (which he received as a reward from the wealthy Spanish family that owned him) into his adolescent years. In 1801, he stunned Peruvians by declaring that cancer is not contagious. Although initially criticized, confirmation of his discovery in Europe brought him great respect, which otherwise would have been impossible to attain, given his racial status."

He wasnot formally educated but had read the works of Czech priests like Matthias of Janov and Jan Hus.Augusta joined the Unitas Fratrum in 1524 after exploring and rejecting other Christian communities. He was elected a bishop of the Unitas Fratrum in 1532 and in 1535 journeyed to Wittenberg, Germany on behalf of the Unity to consult with Martin Luther. Augusta was named the president of the Inner Council of the Unitas Fratrum in 1547. He prepared Czech and Latin versions of a confession of the faith for the Unity and wrote many hymns that were included in several Czech hymnals. He discouraged members of the Unitas Fratrum from cooperating with Ferdinand I during the Smalkaldic War. After the war was over, Ferdinand banished the whole sect and arrested the principal preachers. Augusta attempted to escape in the garb of a peasant, but was captured and taken in chains to Prague, where he was thrown into prison. He was offered his liberty on condition of making public recantation and becoming either a Catholic or an Utraquist. Augusta was ready to profess himself a Utraquist, but not to recant in public, and he accordingly remained in prison 16 years. He was imprisoned from 1548 to 1564, during which time he maintained correspondence with other leaders of the Unity but was reluctant to relinquish his leadership role to others but was reconciled to them following his release from prison on the death of Ferdinand. As a condition of his release, he had to promise not to preach any more. He died in 1572."

  "text" : "Joan Bastardas i Parera (Barcelona, 1919-2009) was a Catalan Latinist and Romance philologist, the son of the lawyer and politician Albert Bastardas i Sampere. He studied at the University of Barcelona, with Marià Bassols de Climent, and wrote a PhD dissertation on Medieval Latin syntax, for which he received the Antonio de Nebrija Prize (1951). He was also indirectly a student of the Swedish Latinist Dag Norberg. He was first appointed lecturer, then assistant (1967), and finally obtained a chair in Latin Philology (1976) at the University of Barcelona. His research was devoted to Medieval Latin (particularly Hispanic Medieval Latin) and to preliterary Catalan. He was director (1960-1985) of the Glossarium Mediae Latinitatis Cataloniae, a dictionary of the Medieval Latin of Catalonia, a research project which is part of the global project Novum Glossarium Mediae Latinitatis of the Union Académique Internationale. He was a member of the Fundació Bernat Metge committee, which publishes a series of Greek and Latin authors with a Catalan translation. He also collaborated to the Enciclopedia Lingüística Hispánica. In 1972 he was elected a member of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans, where he was also vice-president (1983-1986) and director of the “Lexicographic Office”. He was also appointed as a member of the Acadèmia de Bones Lletres de Barcelona in 1977; his entering speech dealt with the Usatges de Barcelona (customary laws of Barcelona; 12th century). He was awarded the cross “Creu de Sant Jordi” by the Generalitat de Catalunya (1991), the prize Manuel Sanchis Guarner (1996), the essay prize by the Institució de les Lletres Catalanes (1997) and the medal of the Institut d’Estudis Catalans (1997)."

  "text" : "Josef Schrammel, (3 March 1852 – 24 November 1895), was an Austrian composer and musician. He was an illegitimate son of Kasper Schrammel and his later wife Alosia Ernst. Very early in his life, his father recognised the talent of Josef and sent them, despite financial hardship, to the Conservatory of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (Society of Friends of Music in Vienna) where he received violin lessons. Later in his life, he travelled to the Orient. In 1878 Josef founded, along with his brother Johann Schrammel and a guitarist, a trio; the following year Anton Strohmayer replaced the first guitarist. This eventually, with the addition of clarinetist Georg Danzer, became the famous Schrammel Quartet. His grave is located in Hernals in Vienna."

In 1907 he became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government led by Jules de Trooz (1907), a post he kept in the following governments of Frans Schollaert (1907-1911) and Charles de Broqueville (1911-1916). In this function at the start of the First World War he received the German ultimatum, demanding free passage through Belgium. In January 1916 Davignon left the Foreign Office and became Minister without portfolio until his death on 12 March 1916. The day before his death he was ennobled a hereditary viscount in the Belgian nobility. His grandson, Étienne, served as vice-president of the European Commission."

Eubank was the only child of Maude Lee Eubank (1885-1958) and Benjamin Franklin Eubank (1882-1962), a former official of the Louisiana State Police and the state hospital system. Eubank and his wife, the former Katherine Bringhurst, had two children, Robert Benjamin Eubank (born 1942) and Elizabeth Tracy Eubank (born August 1943). Eubank was a maternal grandson of Swords Lee, a timber businessman in Pollock and Alexandria, who represented Grant Parish in the Louisiana House from 1904 to 1908. He was a descendant of the Lee family of Virginia. His middle name is derived from his great-grandmother, Martha Roland Lee, spelled without the \"w\".

It is based on a tale from Boccaccio's Decameron, which features also in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales: that of patient Griselda, who displays continuing devotion to her husband despite his brutal attempts to test her loyalty. The play was registered with the Stationers' Company in July 1565 and July 1568. His name also appears as John Phillipp in the quarto of The Play of Patient Grisell. He is thought to be the John Philip, John Phillip or John Phillips who wrote ballads, tracts and elegies between 1566 and 1591. The lullaby \"Be still, my sweet sweeting\" from The Play of Patient Grisell (lines 1383–98) has been set to music several times: \n*  Peter Warlock – \"Cradle Song\" (1927) \n*  Benjamin Britten – \"The Nurse's Song\" in the song cycle A Charm of Lullabies, Op. 41 (1947) \n*  Jack Gibbons – \"Cradle Song\", Op. 64 (2005)"

  "text" : "James Baylis was a theatre entrepreneur and entertainment provider in 19th century Glasgow, where he originated music halls and theatres from the 1840s until his death in 1870. One of his major developments was the Theatre Royal, Glasgow which continues today and is owned by Scottish Opera. Baylis was born in Ireland, the son of a bandmaster in the army, and settled in Glasgow with his wife Christina Ferguson Baylis. He worked as a book keeper in a brewery and in evenings and weekends in the late 1840s was the manager of Sloan's Oddfellows Singing Saloon, Saltmarket, Glasgow Cross, owned by Christina's brother-in-law. He was helped in his variety developments by his brother Sam Baylis who became the noted owner of the Baylis Marionnette Company, most active in England and Ireland. James Baylis determined to have his own music halls and theatres. The first was the Milton Colosseum, in the Milton Arcade, Cowcaddens Cross, which he ran on \"popular prices, good companies, and temperance refreshments\". His second opened in 1862 after he bought land in Stockwell Street near Howard Street and built the Scotia Music Hall, also named the Scotia Variety Theatre. Its architect was Robert Black and the Scotia was promoted as the first and largest purpose built music hall for variety in Scotland, and the only one which remained open all year round. Mr and Mrs Baylis set high standards for variety entertainment. In 1875 it was rebuilt, after a fire, to new designs by architects Campbell Douglas and James Sellars. When Christina Baylis died in 1898 it was bought by Moss Empires and later renamed as The Metropole Theatre. His third major project was in 1867 when the theatre complex now known as the Theatre Royal, Glasgow opened in Cowcaddens at the corner of Hope Street. It contained the Royal Colosseum & Opera House, where Baylis presented plays, opera, revues and pantomime; and shops, with the smaller Alexandra Music Hall above. Before his death in 1870 he leased the Royal Colosseum to William Glover who had run the older Theatre Royal in Dunlop Street. The Baylis Trust sold their interest a decade later, and subsequent owners were Howard & Wyndham and Scottish Television."

  "text" : "Jeremiah S. Bacon, known as J. S. Bacon (September 16, 1858 – August 3, 1939), was a Democrat from rural Heflin, Louisiana, who represented Webster Parish in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1926 to 1932. A notary public and a justice of the peace, Bacon won a special election to complete the second term of State Representative J. Frank Colbert, later the mayor of Minden, the Webster Parish seat of government. Colbert resigned when Governor Henry Fuqua appointed him to the Louisiana Tax Commission, a position that he continued under Governors Oramel H. Simpson and Huey P. Long, Jr. After election to a term of his own in 1928, Bacon was succeeded in 1932 by fellow Democrat E. N. Payne of Springhill in northern Webster Parish. Bacon's wife, the former Martha Jane Heflin (1859-1942), referred to in another source as Hattie Heflin Bacon, was the daughter of Charles Buckner Heflin (1829-1910) and his first wife, the former Fannie Susan Laird, who died in 1870. The Bacons had four children, Susan, Fannie, Sallie, and Jeremiah Martin Bacon (1894-1970), who was married to Z. Thelma Bacon. Martha Bacon was previously married to John Wesley Russell, by whom she had three children, Webb, Dena and Bertha. The community of Heflin is named for Charles Heflin, an Alabama native and a veteran of the Confederate Army who operated a cotton gin and engaged in the mercantile business there after the American Civil War. J. S. Bacon's brother-in-law from Charles Heflin's second marriage, William Thomas Heflin (1868-1936), was a businessman engaged in the timber industry who in 1916 was elected sheriff of Winn Parish in North Louisiana. Bacon, his wife, son, and other family members are interred at Fellowship Cemetery in Dubberly in south Webster Parish."

In the mid-1930s he took a break from films, focusing on the legitimate stage, including a directorial stint of the play, Mackerel Skies, which had a short run at the Playhouse Theatre in 1936. Roche returned to films in 1941, with a small role in the Norma Shearer vehicle, We Were Dancing (1942), based on the Noël Coward play of the same name. Over the course of his career he was involved in over half a dozen Broadway productions and appeared in over 50 films. His final screen appearance was in 1946's The Brute Man.

  "text" : "John William Hayward (1844–1913) is a Newfoundland artist and inventor. He was born July 18, 1844 in Harbour Grace to John Hayward and Flora Currie. His mother died in August, 1844. He also worked as a bank clerk in St. Johns, Newfoundland. He did some important work about flags used to identify ships and signals: Flag charts of the 1800s are much more numerous than those of the centuries before. However, and almost without exception, they were the province of one man, John William Hayward (1843-1913), a self-taught artist and son of a wealthy merchant family of the city. Along with landscape paintings and engraved vignettes of contemporary St. John’s life, Hayward produced many signal flag charts, many in watercolour, and some as mass-produced lithographed broadsheets complete with advertisements of prominent city businesses. Hayward’s charts showed many new businesses and families joining the ranks of prominence by acquiring their own house flags, and prominent they were. Families such as the Ayres, Bowrings, Bairds, and Harveys of St. John’s were perhaps more important to the commercial and social life of the city then than were the Eatons, Simpsons, or Gooderhams to Toronto, or the Rockefellers and Vanderbilts to New York. While “Hayward’s Flags” (as this aspect of his work is often called), may lose some accuracy to the researcher by their decorative Victorian exuberance, it is that same exuberance and his decorative depiction of the signal and commercial flags of St. John’s that gives important clues to the prominent place these flags played in the city’s life. Hayward’s charts bustle with the life of a busy day along the docks in the harbour. He did also drawings and engravings. He was a self-taught artist."

  "text" : "James Sibree (1836–1929) was an English missionary in Madagascar with an interest in the natural history and cultural history of the island. He was a contemporary of the French naturalist Alfred Grandidier and wrote detailed books about the flora and fauna of Madagascar, the country's general history, and the mission history on the island. He also helped revise the Malagasy Bible and wrote several works in the Malagasy language. He was a vocal advocate of Malagasy independence prior to the French invasion of Madagascar in 1895. Sibree also designed and helped build almost 100 new mission buildings and 50 churches in Madagascar. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and earned an honorary degree from the University of St Andrews. Swiss zoologist Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major named Sibree's dwarf lemur after him in 1896. Son of a Congregational minister, he apprenticed as a civil engineer before travelling to Antananarivo, Madagascar in 1863 on assignment from the London Missionary Society (LMS) to oversee the construction of four churches. After returning to England in 1867, he was ordained in 1870. He returned to Madagascar from 1870 to 1877, leaving again following difficulties with the Malagasy government. After spending a few years in England and South India, he returned to Madagascar again in 1883 and stayed until 1915. He died in 1929 due to a car accident. He and his wife had five children, four of which also become missionaries."

  "text" : "Joan Lacey Mazauskas (January 25, 1933 - April 23, 2003) was an American author and Republican Party politician. She was the author of Mayday! Mayday! Eastern Airlines In A Tailspin! (1990). In 1977, Mazauskas sought the Republican nomination for State Senator in the 28th legislative district of New Jersey, where Democratic incumbent Martin L. Greenberg was seeking re-election to a second term. The GOP primary included three candidates, each aligned with a different candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor: Joan Lacey Mazauskas ran with State Sen. Raymond Bateman, Rev. James A. Pindar ran on a line with Assembly Minority Leader Thomas Kean; and Rocco Clarizio was allied with former Senate Minority Leader C. Robert Sarcone. Pindar defeated Mazauskas by just 207 votes, 1,482 (42.04%) to 1,275 (36.17%), while Clarizio ran a distant third with 768 votes (21.79%). Her husband, George Mazauskas, served as a Town Councilman in Irvington, New Jersey."

  "text" : "Johannes (Hans) van Oort (4 September 1949) is Professor of Patristics and Gnostic Studies at Radboud University, Nijmegen, and at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. He is best known for his specialty in the study of the Church Father Augustine, the gnostic world religion of Mani (Manicheism), and the Gospel of Judas. In 2006 he presented, with National Geographic, the discovery of this gnostic “gospel” to the Dutch speaking world. Biography Van Oort studied Latin and Greek, and subsequently theology, at the University of Utrecht. Here he received his Doctorate with highest distinction for “Jeruzalem en Babylon: Een onderzoek van Augustinus’ De stad van God en de bronnen van zijn leer van de twee steden (rijken)” (1986), a thesis that saw its fourth Dutch edition published in 1995. The English edition was published in 1991 as Jerusalem and Babylon: A Study of Augustine’s City of God and the Sources of his Doctrine of the Two Cities and was reprinted in paperback by Brill Academic Publishers, Leiden-Boston in 2013. Van Oort has been involved in higher education since 1972, from 1980-1983 as scientific associate in Church History at Utrecht University and from 1983-1987 as university lecturer in Religious Pedagogy and Didactics at the same university. During this time, he was also scientific researcher of the Dutch Research Organization ZWO (now NWO), and editor of an educational review. In 1987 he was appointed as Senior Research Fellow of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences (KNAW) for research into Augustine and the sources of his theology. The year 1992 saw his appointment as senior lecturer in Church History and History of Christian Doctrine at Utrecht University, followed in 1999 with his appointment as extraordinary professor in Gnostic Studies at Nijmegen, where he became ordinary professor in 2000. Gnostic Studies and Augustine Van Oort’s study of Augustine and the sources for his theology has made him a specialist in Gnostic Studies as well, particularly in the gnostic-Christian world church of Mani (216-276/7). He has served as member of the International Association of Manichaean Studies first as secretary (1993-2001) and subsequently as president (2001-2009). In this capacity he was one of the scholars who took initiative to publish the many Manichaean sources that were at the time scattered throughout the world, in the Corpus Fontium Manichaeorum, a project that gained wide support among academies of science and UNESCO. Van Oort is member of diverse international organisations and academies of science, and was Visiting Professor in Oxford, London and Warwick in service to the British Academy from 1998-1999. Johannes van Oort has published some 25 monographs, mainly on the topics of Augustine and the gnostic world church of Mani.

  "text" : "Johnny Odd Bergh (May 6, 1934 - December 23, 2014) was a Norwegian producer, scriptwriter and director. He was a key player in the development of Norwegian television, and one of the most influential people in Norwegian entertainment until the mid 90s. Bergh started his career as a jazz musician and comedy actor in Bergen, and studied acting at The Norwegian National Academy of Theatre. In 1958 he was recruited to The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation - two years before regular television broadcasts started in Norway - as employee number 12. After just a few years he became a prominent director and producer. As one of the first tv workers in Norway, Bergh worked for the first years with everything from The Nobel Peace Price and the news to theatre and large studio shows. It was however entertainment that would become his speciality. During his career he produced several thousand tv programs. The shows went on to become benchmark productions for Norwegian entertainment, and many want on for many seasons, some still being in production. Programs include: Lørdagskveld med Erik Bye (talkshow), Kontrapunkt (quiz show), Momarkedet (live variety show), Kvitt eller dobbelt (Norwegian version of The $64,000 Question), Ta sjansen (annual event), Dette er ditt liv (Norwegian version of This is Your Life), Nyttårsshow (variety show), OL-show (olympic variety show), Spellemannprisen (Norwegian music awards) og Melodi Grand Prix (Eurovision Song Contest). He was the responsible national producer for the Nordic collaborative Nordivision-broadcasts in the early days of Norwegian television. Bergh also directed concerts with international artists such as Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Bill Evans, Jim Reeves and Otis Redding. From 1986 til 1990 Bergh was the editorial director at the NRK's entertainment department. Bergh had a close professional and personal relationship with tv hosts like Erik Bye, Knut Bjørnsen, Erik Diesen og Harald Tusberg - and produced and developed several shows with all of them. He gave Norwegian entertainment personalities like Harald Heide-Steen jr., Roald Øyen og Stein Roger Bull their first jobs in television - and launched Dan Børge Akerø as an entertainment name. He also got to work with international artists like Julie Andrews, Bing Crosby, Johnny Weissmuller, Josephine Baker, Ken Curtis, Danny Kaye, The Delta Rhythm Boys, Marty Feldman, Donna Summer, Tina Turner, ABBA and Cliff Richards. Bergh won six times in Rose D'Or in Montreux with different comedy shows. Among these prize winning productions are To Norway - Home of Giants, starring John Cleese, which won two awards. Productions by Johnny Bergh got over 30% of the places when the Norwegian paper Dagbladet awarded the best Norwegian tv entertainment ever in 2010. Bergh has had a strong influence as a role model, mentor and creator of TV as a visual medium. He was the first in Norway who could tell a story with living images on TV. Through his work he created a school for producing that made the foundation of the professional level of production in Norway today. Bergh was married to the TV producer Bitte Monn-Iversen, daughter of composer and producer Egil Monn-Iversen and singer, comedian and actor Sølvi Wang, and died on December 23, 2014 at the age of 80."

  "text" : "John Dixon Gibbs (1834–1912) was a British engineer and financier who, together with Lucien Gaulard is often credited as the co-inventor of the AC step-down transformer. The transformer was first demonstrated in 1883 at London's Royal Aquarium. At the time the term \"transformer\" had not yet been invented, so instead it was referred to as a \"secondary generator\". Although he is usually credited equally with Gaulard, Gibb's role in the invention appears to have been more that of a financial backer and businessman. Although the underlying physics of the transformer, mainly Faraday's law of induction, had been known since the 1830s, transformers only became viable after the introduction of Gaulard and Gibbs's transformer design in 1883. The breakthrough was to build an iron transformer core which could act as a magnetic circuit. At the time, their invention was seen as overcomplicated since it contained a movable armature. It caught the attention of Sir Coutts Lindsay, who used it to power the Grosvenor Gallery, which was one of the first lighting systems in Britain powered by a central generating station. In 1885 Ottó Bláthy, Miksa Déri and Károly Zipernowsky secured a patent on a similar design, using laminated sheets of metal to reduce eddy currents. Information on an exhibition of Gibbs and Gaulard's transformer in Turin, Italy in 1884 was published in 1885 and caught the attention of George Westinghouse. In the summer of 1885 Westinghouse bought the American rights for Gibbs and Gaulard's design and ordered that several transformers from Gibbs and Gaulard be purchased and shipped to his factory in Pittsburgh. Westinghouse then asked the engineer William Stanley, Jr. to design an electric lighting system using them. Stanley subsequently greatly improved on Gibbs and Gaulard's design and is often credited in their place. John Dixon Gibbs had his work patented under German patent no. 28947, a patent also recognized in Great Britain. The patent was disputed by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti. Following patent litigation, Gibbs and Gaulard lost the patent. Gibbs appealed the suit, taking the case all the way to the House of Lords, where he again lost. He was financially ruined in the process."

Shortly after earning her Ph.D., she worked as a post-doctoral fellow at the IBM research laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland from 1965 to 1967, before returning to America to serve as a physics professor at Indiana University for 18 years. After her time at Indiana University, Franz spent 5 years on the faculty of West Virginia University and three years on the faculty of the University of Alabama in Huntsville. In 1994, she took a five-year leave of absence from her faculty position to assume her position as executive officer of the American Physical Society (APS). Franz has published a number of high-profile articles on condensed matter physics, most notably related to the theoretical calculations of electron state wave functions in systems undergoing metal-insulator transitions. She was a key advocate for improving physics education, and has received the Melba Newell Phillips Medal for Creative Leadership in Physics Education from the The American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT). She served as Executive Officer of the American Physical Society for 15 years, encouraging more women to pursue careers in physics. She is now retired."

  "text" : "Juan K. Taduran was a Filipino track and field athlete who competed in the decathlon and in middle-distance running events. In the 1920s he won three consecutive gold medals in the decathlon at the Far Eastern Championship Games – a forerunner of the Asian Games. Taduran made his first international impact at the 1919 Far Eastern Championship Games in Manila, where he was the close runner-up to China's Chu Ente in the decathlon and placed third in the 880-yard run. He returned for the 1921 Games and defeated defending Ente in Shanghai to become the Far Eastern decathlon champion – the second Filipino to do so after Genaro Saavedra. He won that title two more times successively at the 1923 Games and 1925 Games. This made him the second athlete to win three straight titles in an event at the competition, after multiple sprint champion Fortunato Catalon. Ultimately this made him the most successful combined events athlete in the competition's history. Taduran also won an 800 metres bronze medal in his final appearance in 1925. Following his retirement from athletics he turned to coaching and was head coach of the Filipino baseball team for the 1930 Far Eastern Championship Games. The Philippines were defeated in all games at that tournament."

  "text" : "James Nyx Jr. (May 3, 1914 – July 16, 1998), sometimes credited as James Nyx, was an American songwriter for the Motown label. He co-wrote \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\" which became a #9 hit for Marvin Gaye in 1971. Nyx was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, but moved to Detroit in the 1930s, where he married twice and raised a family of eight children. He supported them through jobs requiring menial labor. At one time he was a resident of the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects, where notable figures such as Diana Ross grew up. His start in the music business was working as a janitor and handyman for Tri-Phi/Harvey Records, which was owned by the husband and wife team of Harvey Fuqua and Gwen Gordy Fuqua, sister of Berry Gordy. He began to bring lyric ideas to Harvey, who collaborated with him on a few songs, including 1961's \"Grieving About A Love,\" recorded by Lorri Rudolph. and 1963's \"What Can You Do Now\" recorded by Harvey and Ann. When Fuqua sold his labels to Motown Records in 1963, Nyx came along, signing to Jobete Music as a songwriter, but also working as a janitor and an elevator operator. He continued to write with Fuqua, and also Marvin Gaye, but most of his early songwriting work was shelved. In July 1970, Gaye produced a song for The Originals, a Gaye/Nyx composition called \"We Can Make It Baby.\" Nyx's real breakthrough came a year later, when Gaye needed collaborators to help with lyrics for his next project, the sessions that became the landmark album \"What's Going On.\" Nix co-wrote three tracks on the album, \"What's Happening Brother,\" \"God Is Love,\" and most famously, \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler).\" Motown left Detroit the following year, but Nyx did not go with them. He stayed and continued writing songs for a Detroit company named KellGriff Music. One such effort, 1974's \"Outta My Life/I'm One Who Know\" by the Brewster Crew on Lifeline records (T. Rodgers/J. Nyx Jr.) was arranged by David Van De Pitte, who famously did the orchestrations for \"What's Going On.\" In the 1990s, it became popular for samples of \"Inner City Blues\" to be used on R&B and rap records, providing Nyx with royalty income."

  "text" : "Josephine Whittell (November 30, 1883 – June 1, 1961) was an American character actress of the silent and sound film eras. Born on November 30, 1883 in San Francisco, California, she began her film career during the silent era, appearing in a featured role in 1917's Alimony. She would only appear in four silent films, between 1917 and 1921, before taking a hiatus from the film industry. In 1931 Whittell would return to films, with supporting roles in two Wheeler and Woolsey comedies, Caught Plastered and Peach O'Reno. During her 43 year career, she would appear in over 70 films. In the early 1930s, she would appear frequently as the older seductress in films, prior to the enactment of the film code in the mid-1930s. Over her career she would appear in many notable films, either in supporting or small roles. Some of those films include: Stage Door (1938), starring Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, and Adolphe Menjou; 1939's The Women, with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, and Rosalind Russell; the 1945 version of State Fair, starring Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews; King Vidor's The Fountainhead, the film version of the Ayn Rand novel of the same name, starring Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal; the musical, In the Good Old Summertime, with Judy Garland and Van Johnson; George Stevens' A Place in the Sun, starring Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor and Shelley Winters; the Cecil B. De Mille epic, The Greatest Show on Earth; and the classic 1954 version of A Star is Born, directed by George Cukor, and starring Judy Garland and James Mason. She remained active in films till very late in life, making her last appearance in 1959's The Buccaneer, directed by Anthony Quinn (his only directing credit), and starring Yul Brynner, Claire Bloom, Charles Boyer, and Inger Stevens. She would die less than three years after working on The Buccaneer, on June 1, 1961. She was cremated and interred in Chapel Of The Pines Crematory in Los Angeles."

  "text" : "John Ruthven was a military officer who served in Denmark and Sweden during the Thirty Years' War before returning for brief service in the British Civil Wars. He served first as a captain in Danish service from 1627. As King Christian IV of Denmark-Norway made peace with the Habsburg Emperor in 1629 Ruthven, along with many other Scottish soldiers in Danish service, then turned to Sweden to continue the war. He first appears in Swedish service in 1629 serving as a captain of the Scottish infantry at Stralsund under the command of Alexander Leslie. He was soon promoted lieutenant-colonel in Leslie's infantry regiment (by 1630) and led an infantry-regiment in the battle of Breitenfeld on 17 September 1631 as full colonel. He later took part in the battle at the Alte Veste near Nuernberg on 3 September 1632, and later took part in the bloody conquest of Landsberg/Lech (Bavaria) under the command of Lennart Torstensson. Ruthven was promoted to major-general by 1636 and took part in the battle of Wittstock as defacto commander of the reserve when Major General Vitzthum refused orders to advance. Evidence from eye-witness accounts by the generals show that this was John and not his uncle Patrick Ruthven as sometimes claimed. In 1638 he sought permission to leave Swedish service in order to return to Scotland to participate in the Bishops' Wars under his uncle's command. John Ruthven appears to have not taken part in any of the action in this conflict, but did hold the king's commission. When the Civil Wars broke out in England in 1642, John Ruthven appears to have retired from service, and did not join his uncle's retinue in England. Having married Barbara Leslie, the eldest daughter of Alexander Leslie, now Lord General of the Army of the Solemn League and Covenant (and having witnessed the strength of the Covenanters in Scotland in this period), a shrewd move for harmonious family relations."

He served in the First Provincial Congress of Massachusetts and as a colonel in the American Revolution. He was later appointed a judge for Worcester County, Massachusetts. He was one of four judges to oversee the trial and subsequent execution of Bathsheba Spooner, who was the first woman to be executed in the United States by Americans rather than the British. Foster was part of a committee of three which was appointed to draft the first Constitution of Massachusetts. However, Foster died before the work was completed in 1779. The site of his home, known as Jedediah Foster Homesite is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is now a small park."

  "text" : "Joanne Cole (1934-1985) was the illustrator of children's books in the 1960s through to the 1980s. She also created artwork and puppets for British TV children's programmes.Together with husband Michael Cole they created Bod. Bod originally appeared as four books, published in the UK by Methuen in 1965 and later released in France and the United States. The Coles collaborated on other children books including Wet Albert (1967) about a boy followed around by a rain cloud with crayon drawings by Cole and a series of four Kate and Sam books (1971) about the over-imaginative ideas of a young brother and sister.She also illustrated seven Jill Tomlinson books, including The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark (1973). In 1972 the Coles created the children's BBC TV show Fingerbobs, starring Rick Jones and the finger-puppet adventures of a paper mouse and his friends, made by Cole. In 1973 Cole created puppets and artwork for BBC children's programme Ragtime, which won a Society of Film and Television Award (later known as a BAFTA) in 1973 for Best Children's Programme  and was followed by a second series.In 1975 the original Bod books were developed into a BBC children's show. The Bod stories were made into 5 minute films animated by Alan Rogers, based on Cole's original drawings, narrated by John Le Mesurier and with music by Derek Griffiths. The rest of the programme, narrated by Maggie Henderson, was made up of Cole's illustrations with games such as Bod snap, songs and stories of Alberto Frog and his Amazing Animal Band.Bod was broadcast on BBC until 1984. It was also shown in Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Poland and Israel. In the United States, Bod aired on Nickelodeon as part of the Pinwheel program.The series of 13 episodes included nine new Bod adventures which were published as books in 1977 and illustrated by Cole. In 1982 Cole co- wrote with her husband the BBC children's programme Gran. These tales of a most surprising grandmother, which were later developed into books illustrated by Cole, were animated by Ivor Wood and narrated by Patricia Hayes. She also provided artwork regularly for ITV's Rainbow and BBC's Play School. Cole died of cancer in 1985 aged 51 and in the same year Michael Cole wrote and produced Fingermouse, a musical version of Fingerbobs starring paper puppets made by Cole."

  "text" : "John Waterloo Wilson (May 16, 1815 – August 12, 1883) was a Belgian art collector who lived many years in Haarlem. Wilson was born in Brussels as the son of the British industrialist Thomas Wilson, whose factory in Ukkel-Stalle had been damaged in 1830 by workers on strike. As a friend of Willem I of the Netherlands he won a contract for a new cotton factory in Haarlem and the young John relocated there with his family in 1833. He studied chemistry in Manchester, England, presumably to learn more about the cotton-dyeing process that Haarlem was famous for at the time. In 1839 he married the daughter of the Haarlem mayor Wilhelmina Christina van Valkenburg, who died young in 1844 and left him with three young children. He travelled in Turkey and Egypt but his health prevented him from travel in 1872 when he started to concentrate on art collecting. He followed in his father's footsteps as director of the firm and also as art collector, but returned to Brussels in 1873 where he showed his art collection and published a catalogue. His collector's mark is known as Lugt number 2581. Like his father before him, Wilson was also owner of a manor house in Overijssel. He left 27 paintings and a large sum of money to the city of Brussels, which named a street after him in gratitude: Rue John Waterloo Wilson. His gift was instrumental in founding the Museum of the City of Brussels. He and his father's cotton factory is remembered on its former location in Haarlem as the \"Wilsonplein\", today the location of the city theatre. Wilson died in Neuilly-sur-Seine. He was the grandfather of the Dutch sport shooter John Wilson."

  "text" : "John Robertson was an early settler of Bell's Corners, Nepean Township, Carleton County, Ontario. While much has been written about him, particularly during the renaming controversy regarding Robertson Road, little of it has been documented. He has been described as a pioneer, weaver, foreman for the Rideau Canal, stone mason, mechanical engineer, storekeeper, farmer, major landowner, lumberman, pathmaster, surveyor of roads, Highway Commissioner, magistrate, councillor, warden of Nepean Township , agriculturalist, benefactor to his community, and an entrepreneur in his lifetime. He was born in Perthshire, Scotland in 1797 and became a silk weaver by trade before emigrating to Canada in 1827. That same year he purchased a partially cleared homestead in what would later become Bell's Corners. The Rev. J. L. Gourlay in his 1896 History of the Ottawa Valley described Robertson thusly: \"South of Bell's Corners dwelt a man of immense brain power, and the most prominent man as merchant, lumberer, and farmer successful in all, and whose heart was as kind as his head was clear. His ashes have slept for years, but it does us good at this date to bear a true testimony to his undoubted talents and real genuine worth. John Robertson was born in Perthshire, Scotland, and came to this country in 1827, and took up the land now occupied by his son, Thomas McKay Robertson. Some of his sons are deceased many years. One of these, Ebenezer, gave early signs of the greatest promise as an enterprising business man, raised great expectations in his parent's minds, which, had he been spared, we believe he would have fully met or exceeded. It seems the loss of him to his father was irreparable. It prostrated and nearly killed that man of great mind. We do not mean in speaking thus to say that John Robertson had no defects or faults (all men have). But to a thinking mind the excellencies hid the defects. It would never occur to such to hunt them up. Some have dwelt on them, made much of them. But they had their own defects and blemishes, whilst they could not lay claim to one tithe of his towering genius. His wife was not like him, though a distant connection of his own. She was cool, intelligent, kind-hearted, well informed and good, a woman among a thousand.\" \"[He] began his life in Canada ... as an overseer of the works of the Rideau canal. Thomas McKay and John Redpath, of Montreal, had the contract, and from their knowledge of Mr. Robertson's engineering skill, employed him... The Perth silk-weaver soon showed his acquaintance with mason work, and brought the canal eventually to a grand success. Redpath and McKay had to cart home, in Mexican silver half dollars, etc., their part of the profits of the contract. Robertson had only good wages and a name worth much, and some experience.\" \"There was a lull in the canal works and Redpath and McKay built, with the idle men, the first stone church where St Andrew's now stands.... McKay was an elder respected highly in the church, and we often met John Redpath in synod; a very strong man. He afterwards went into the refining of sugar and left great riches. Thomas McKay was afterwards an Honorable in the legislature of the provinces.\" Robertson continued to work on the canal system until 1834 as well as farming. After the canal was finished, he began storekeeping and branched out into lumbering in the Township of Nepean and on the Bonnechere River. The first fair in the County of Carleton was held in Bell’s Corners in 1836 on land donated by John Robertson. He took a prominent and leading role for many years in the affairs of Nepean Township. He was pathmaster in 1837 collecting money for roads and supervising construction. On December 17, 1838, Robertson purchased 100 acres of lot 9, concession II, Ottawa front from John D. McKay. Then in September 1839, he received the first crown patent for all 200 acres of the adjacent lot 8. By 1855, he owned at least 1,100 acres in the Bell’s Corners area. The 1879 Belden map of the area also shows that he owned all of lot 35, concession V, Rideau front on the other side of what would later become Robertson Road where Westcliffe Estates is now located. Robertson and his wife had a number of children, among them sons Thomas and Ebenezer. Although Robertson sold various parcels of land over the years to others, what remained in the family was passed on or sold to Thomas. Thomas McKay Robertson is considered the first male white child born in Bytown. He established a store in 1841, which did the largest business in the area. While Robertson was well known for his farming, the Canada Directory of 1857-58 listed him as a Lt. Col. in the Carleton Battalion as well as a \"dealer in dry goods, hardware, groceries, produce, &c.\" In 1842, Robertson was surveyor of roads in Nepean, then Highway Commissioner. He was a magistrate for nine years in the Township. In 1848 when Nepean commenced to run its own affairs alone there were 169 ratepayers in the Township entitled to vote, and John Robertson was elected Town Warden. In 1850, when Nepean Township was formally incorporated John Robertson was elected Councillor, a position he held for some years. John Robertson was one of the founders of the Bell’s Corners Union Cemetery in 1853. He was a very religious man and one who believed in education. Gourlay wrote: \"The first school house was raised near Robertson's as he boarded the teacher or teachers free of cost for years. We remember he proposed to spend what he would have to pay in board, for his two grandsons, W. Goodfellow, and Ebenezer B. Brown at Ottawa, if we could procure him a fit teacher, and add this to his salary in the section. We sent him the man and he was there over twenty years. Stories were told of a wooden church built and supplied at his own expense\" On March 18, 1868, John Robertson wrote an article published in The Canadian Farmer detailing his farming methods and their effect on crop yields and livestock production. Gourlay: \"whatever Mr. Robertson did in other lines, he was intensely interested in farming. With his low level, stiff, clay soil, was at once the most scientific, and the most successful agriculturist in the Ottawa Valley. His land was swamp and had to be raised by drains that doubled its value. He had great potash works, turned the leached ashes on the land, then dry ashes, buying from everybody around. Agricultural chemistry (Johnston's) he had almost in his memory. He bought up almost everything printed in English or French on agriculture. He sent to London, England, for a ton of sulphate of ammonia for plant food on the farm or as a fertilizer. He under drained so much that some American, visiting the place, predicted that when large clearings would be made, his land would be useless in drought. He concluded the fulfilment of such predictions must be far, far away. Three large hemlock poles made the piping for his first drains, and he discovered 23 years after, that when he cut through one, the poles were fresh and peeled like as if they had been cut in June.\" \"Cheese making claimed his attention later, at which with 60 or 70 cows he was a success. He followed it up scientifically, found that ten pounds of milk made one pound of cheese, twenty-five pounds of milk, one pound of butter. The hired girls milked 60 cows and Mr. and Mrs. Robertson made the cheese. He kept so carefully accounts of all his outlay on the whole crops of the farm, that he could by a look at his books, give you at once a statement of what every hundred pounds cost that grew or was raised on the whole farm.\" His first wife died in 1869. He later remarried. However, the great fire of August 1870 destroyed his entire property. Gourlay wrote: \"he disclaimed any sympathy when the terrible fire swept all his buildings and crops away. He said he had plenty in the bank. He never rebuilt the ruins....; The disastrous fire of 1870, that ran over fourteen townships, swept away from him the labors of a lifetime. His splendid dwelling house, with barns, stables, feeding houses of every kind, were consumed; all save his livestock that roamed over unfenced fields, green turnips, crop plots, potato fields, in that August drought, maddened with the pain of being un-milked for days as we saw them, and heard their bellowing groans that moved our pity to beg the hired girls, whom we met as we drove past, to milk them, for once on the ground, promising them pay for their trouble. We are always sorry to see these ruins as we pass, they wake up so many old associations and reflections.\" In September 1880, John Robertson, then aged 83, wrote for his grandson, Ebenezer Robertson, a practical guide for all farming activities, with particular emphasis placed on the economics of farming. There were 280 pages of advice, wrapped in old Montreal newspapers. It was purchased in 1959 by the Manuscript Collection, Canadian History Department, Metropolitan Toronto. John Robertson died on 3 January 1884 at the age of 87. He is buried in the Bells Corners Union Cemetery."

He was once, and still is, considered one of the best Melee players in the world. At one point, he was even considered the best Brawl player in the world, as well as the best Meta Knight player in the world. Although M2K has only won 2 Melee majors since 2013, he has still placed second or third at many of them, and also regularly beats other members of the Big Six. Zimmerman was ranked 3rd in the world in the 2013 SSBMRank, 4th in 2014, and 5th in 2015."

Although there are references to Jean de Forcade de Biaix as the \"Marquis de Biaix\" in some Prussian sources published between 1788-1837, there is no evidence that he was ever a Marquis. The noble fief of Biaix in the city of Pau was not a marquisate. He was also never Seigneur de Biaix. The title Seigneur was not hereditary. In the case of his family, his father, who purchased the fief of Biaix in 1659, was the Seigneur de Biaix."

  "text" : "Jevington Blair (Jev) Tothill (born 1928 or 1929) is a former Canadian politician, who was the leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party from 1979 to 1981. Prior to his political career, Tothill was a high school teacher in the Cowichan Valley region of Vancouver Island who was known for creating a local community television service, and was an unsuccessful candidate for the party in the electoral district of Cowichan-Malahat in the 1975 provincial election. He won the leadership at the party's leadership convention on February 19, 1979. His predecessor, Gordon Gibson, had held the party's only seat in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia at the time of his resignation, leaving the party without legislative representation. Tothill soon announced plans to run as the party's candidate in a pending by-election in North Vancouver-Seymour, although that by-election was cancelled by the issuance of writs for the 1979 election. In that election, the only one under Tothill's leadership, the Liberals ran just five candidates provincewide and were entirely shut out of the legislature for the first time in their history. Tothill resigned as leader in late 1980, and was succeeded by Shirley McLoughlin at the party's 1981 leadership convention."

  "text" : "John James Robinson (28 June 1872 – 3 January 1959) was an English sportsman who played rugby union for the England national rugby union team and for Cambridge University, and also played first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and for Cambridge University. He was born in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire and died at Headingley, Leeds, Yorkshire. The son of a brewer, Robinson was educated at Appleby Grammar School near Atherstone in Warwickshire and at St John's College, Cambridge. In his first year at Cambridge University he appears not to have played rugby, but he was chosen for the freshmen's match cricket trial, and scored 11 and 58, batting in the lower-order. But he was not then given any first-team games in that or the subsequent two seasons. From 1892, he played first-team rugby for the Cambridge rugby team regularly and he was awarded a Blue in both 1892 and 1893, playing in the annual Varsity Match against Oxford. He returned to cricket in 1893, finally playing a single first-class game for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against the university side, a ploy sometimes used by Cambridge to try out new players; he scored 15 and 12 not out but still did not earn a call-up to the university side. In 1894, however, he was tried in an early match for the university team as an opening bowler and proceeded to take seven wickets for 93 runs in the first innings he bowled in: these remained his career best bowling figures. He then retained his place as a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm opening bowler to the end of the university season, and appeared in the University Match against Oxford University, thereby becoming a \"double Blue\". Robinson appeared in four rugby internationals for England. He played in an 8-0 defeat by Scotland while an undergraduate at Cambridge, and then played against all the other three \"home\" international side in 1902, when his club rugby was for Headingley. He did not play any further first-class cricket after leaving Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1894. He became a solicitor and practised at Nottingham and Leeds."
