She is the co-author, with Linton Besser, of He who must be Obeid, an unauthorised biography of formerNSW Minister Eddie Obeid. Kate McClymont was successfully sued for defamation by former Macquarie Bank executive Bill Moss for A$49,000 plus legal costs. According to The Australian the judge said \"The particular chapter in which Mr Moss is featured is headed The Bagman, evidently a reference to Mr (Eddie) Obeid’s role in an attempt to bribe the NSW Labor government in circumstances where the approval of poker machines was a central requirement of the success of a development proposal backed by Mr Obeid,” “Many other characters in the book come in for similar treatment to that involved in the discussion of Mr Moss. That is, there is a collection of statements which, while not openly attributing dishonesty or corruption to those persons, convey those notions in the careful language of insinuation and scepticism.”"

  "text" : "Kathy Hamilton is an Illinois elected official who serves as the chairwoman of the Board of Trustees at the College of DuPage, a community college in the Chicago suburbs. She was chosen as chairwoman after the election of three \"clean slate\" candidates backed by Hamilton in April 2015. Hamilton is a registered CPA and holds a BA and an MBA in finance. Her term as a trustee of the college has been marked with controversy for her, the college and the college’s top administrators. When the administration came under media scrutiny in 2014 for a number of incidents related to its spending practices, Hamilton made national headlines for trying to make public the details of the college's spending. She opposed a tuition hike; spoke out against the college's attempt to get a $20 million grant from the state; pushed for transparency following the exposure of the college president spending college funds on personal items; and openly criticized the college’s spending and accounting practices. Following these events, she was formally censured by the college's board of trustees. Following her censure, local and national media outlets published stories supporting Hamilton and chastising the college. The Chicago Tribune criticized the college president's actions and the board's censure of Hamilton. Forbes magazine praised her efforts to require public transparency of the college's finances. The Washington Times gave the college its Golden Hammer Award, which the newspapers uses to spotlight waste, fraud and abuse in government. Subsequent to the Hamilton's censure, she continued her public efforts to implement fiscal responsibility and was the only member of the board to vote against a taxpayer-funded $760,000 early retirement buyout of the college president’s contract. The buyout also became a widely covered event in the media and invoked negative reactions from the local community and several Illinois state legislators."

He obtained two medals in his respective category at the ISAF Sailing World Championships (1999 and 2002), and also represented his nation Sweden in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Suneson trained throughout most of his sporting career for the Royal Swedish Yacht Club (Swedish: Kungliga Svenska Segelsällskapet) in Saltsjöbaden under his personal coach and father Wilhel Suneson. Suneson made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he placed fourteenth in the Laser class with a grade of 107, falling short from the top ten spot by a thirteen-point deficit. Two years later, Suneson reached the summit of his sailing career upon taking home the gold medal at the European Championships in Vallensbæk, Denmark. Two months after celebrating his first victory, Suneson sailed a marvelous stretch to add a silver in his collection at the ISAF World Championships in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, United States with a net score of 40, finishing behind Brazil's Robert Scheidt by fifteen points. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Suneson qualified for his second Swedish team in the Laser class by placing eleventh and obtaining a berth from the 2003 ISAF World Championships in Cadiz, Spain. Unlike his previous Olympics, Suneson had a solid feat to climb extensively in sixth place with a remarkable grade of 104 net points in the series, but faded his chance of an Olympic medal after his mediocre effort on the final race."

  "text" : "Lopen Karma Phuntsho (born 1968?) was born in Ura gewog in the Bumthang district of central Bhutan. He was born as the third child of Tothchukpo House to his mother who is a scion of Gaden Lam family which traces its origin to Phajo Drukgom Zhigpo, the priest who brought Drukpa Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism to western Bhutan. Karma learnt basic Chokey alphabets and prayers from his father, who is an incarnate priest and farmer from the Tsakaling Choje family, a religious nobility which claims descent from Bhutan's foremost spiritual saint Pema Lingpa and Tarshong Chukpo house of Ura. He attended Ura Primary School until Class III. Because the school did not have Class IV and he was too small to travel, his parents begged the headmaster to keep him in Ura and repeat. The following year, he travelled to Jakar School with a few friends. The headmaster at the new school mistakenly put Karma again in Class III. Karma today humorously claims that he is perhaps the only person who studied in Class III for three years and received first prizes thrice. Karma spent most of his school winter breaks helping the family cow herder in the neighbouring district of Lhuntse. In 1986, he came to Thimphu and had a short spell at Yangchenphug Higher Secondary School before leaving school to become a monk and study Buddhism at Chagri Monastery. Later, he went to south India to continue his studies spending a year at Sera Monastery then ten years at the Ngagyur Nyingma Institute Since 1994, he has taught Buddhism and related subjects and has served a lecturer at the Ngagyur Nyingma Institute in Byallkuppe and for two years as an abbot at the Shugseb Nunnery in Dharamsala. In 1997, partly he says because young Bhutanese educated in English looked down on monks even though they were very learned, he joined Balliol College Oxford and read for an M.St. in Sanskrit and Classical Indian Religions under Richard Gombrich, Seyfort Ruegg and Michael Aris. In 2003, he received a D.Phil. in Buddhist Studies from Oxford University. He worked as a post-doctoral researcher in CNRS, Paris and as a Research Associate in the Department of Social Anthropology, Cambridge University. He was also the Spalding Fellow in Comparative Religions at Clare Hall and ran The Historical Study and Documentation of the Pad Gling Traditions in Bhutan project subsequently he spent years creating a digital archive of rare Bhutanese manuscripts. Dr Phuntsho is the first Bhutanese to receive a D.Phil from Oxford and the first Bhutanese to become an Oxbridge Fellow. In Bhutan he has founded the Loden Foundation, a charity to promote education and entrepreneurship in Bhutan as well as the Shejun Agency for Bhutan's Cultural Documentation and Research. Lopen Karma specialises in Buddhism, Tibetan & Himalayan Studies and Bhutan, and has published a number of works including eight books, translations, book reviews and articles on Buddhism, Bhutan and Tibetan Studies. His The History of Bhutan RandomHouse New Delhi(2013) and University of Chicago () has been called \"the first book to offer a comprehensive history of Bhutan in English\" and received many applauses from international readers."

  "text" : "Kathleen D'Olier Courtney was born the youngest of five daughters and the fifth of seven children of Lieutenant (later Major) David Charles Courtney (1845-1909) of the Royal Engineers (a native of Milltown, County Dublin, Ireland), and his wife, Alice Margaret (née Mann) at 1 York Terrace, was born in Gillingham on 11 March 1878. Courtney attended and became educated at the private the Anglo-French College in Kensington and the Manse boarding-school in Malvern before spending seven months in Dresden studying the German language. In January 1897 she went to Lady Margaret Hall to study modern languages. The Courtney family were extremely wealthy and never had to worry about finances and in that case, she decided to devote her life to good causes where she was able to help people. In 1908 she was appointed secretary of the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage. One of its members, Helena Swanwick, later revealed that Courtney arrived in Manchester \"with a big reputation\" as an outstanding organizer. In 1911 she moved to London where she worked closely with Millicent Fawcett, an English feminist, intellectual, political and union leader, and writer as honorary secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. A suffragist and Honorary Secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she abandoned her active campaigning for women's suffrage and devoted her life to studying international politics and trying to build bridges towards international cooperation. In April 1915, Aletta Jacobs, a suffragist in the Netherlands, invited suffrage members all over the world to an International Congress of Women in The Hague. Some of the women who attended included Kathleen Courtney, Mary Sheepshanks, Jane Addams, Alice Hamilton, Grace Abbott, Emily Bach,de:Lida Gustava Heymann, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Emily Hobhouse, Chrystal Macmillan, Rosika Schwimmer. At the conference the women formed the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WIL). Kathleen Courtney ultimately was elected as chairperson of the British section. In 1928, she was named a member of the Executive Committee of the British League of Nations Union. In 1939 (the year WWII would begin) she was elected Vice-Chairman. From 1949 to 1951 she served as Chairman. Courtney continued to be involved in the campaign for women's suffrage. She helped establish the Adult Suffrage Society in 1916 and as joint-secretary she lobbied members of the House of Commons for extension of the franchise until the Qualification of Women Act was passed in 1918. The following year she became vice-president of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship. As well as advocating the same voting rights as men, the organisation also campaigned for equal pay, fairer divorce laws and an end to the discrimination against women in the professions. Kathleen Courtney died at her home, unmarried with no children, at 3 Elm Tree Court on 7 December 1974 at age 96. A memorial service was held on 11 April 1975 at St Martin-in-the-Fields."

From 1983 to 1997, Brougher served as a curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles during which he was responsible for several exhibitions, mostly notably \"Jeff Wall\" and \"Hall of Mirrors: Art and Film since 1945\". The latter exhibit featured works by Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick among others. From 1997 to 2000, Brougher served as the director of the Museum of Modern Art (now Modern Art Oxford) in Oxford, England. His most notable work at Oxford was on Alfred Hitchcock and he later (2001) wrote the book \"Notorious-: Alfred Hitchcock and Contemporary Art\". Brougher was curator at the Hirshhorn for nine years beginning in 2000. During that time, he served as chief curator, director of arts and programs, deputy director, and acting director. In 2005, he co-curated (with the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles) a significant survey on synaesthesia called Visual Music and was noted for \"The Cinema Effect: Illusion, Reality and the Moving Image\" exhibition that used media, film, and video which covered Runa Islam, Steve McQueen (director), Paul Chan, and other artists. Among other unusual techniques was his use of a 360-degree video projection for the exterior of the iconic cylindrical Hirshhorn to display \"Song 1\" by the artist Doug Aitken. His final exhibition at the Hirshhorn was the mixed-media project \"Damage Control\". His last promotion at the Hirshhorn occurred in 2007 when Brougher was named Acting Director after Olga Viso stepped down."

  "text" : "Kayman Sankar (3 June 1926 – 11 February 2014) was a Guyanese businessman, philanthropist, and member of parliament. He helped to establish the rice industry on the Essequibo coast, and rose from a labourer to \"Guyana’s most successful rice farmer\". Sankar was born at Cornelia Ida, on the western bank of the Demerara River (in what was then British Guiana, but is now in Guyana's Essequibo Islands-West Demerara region). He was the oldest of five children born to Dukhnee and Sewsankar Boodhoo, both of East Indian extraction. Owing to his family's poverty and his mother's illness, he discontinued his education at the age of nine, initially selling milk and later working as a labourer on the sugarcane fields at Cornelia Ida, where his jobs included weeding, cutting, loading, and manually fertilising the fields with manure. Nicknamed \"Polo\" as a young man for a perceived resemblance to actor Eddie Polo, Sankar eventually saved enough to purchase two acres at Windsor Forest, having supplemented his income by making jewellery and driving a taxi. By 1956, he was farming on Essequibo's Atlantic coast, at Bounty Hall, Dunkeld, and Perth (all now in the Pomeroon-Supenaam region). Sankar subsequently went into partnership with his brother and nephew, purchasing uncleared land between Dunkeld and Perth. He had earlier travelled as far west as the Pomeroon River, searching for land suitable for rice cultivation. Despite initial failures, in 1966 Sankar was able to purchase 1,556 acres (6.30 km2) at Hampton Court, with his first rice crop harvested two years later. The land was expanded further in 1975, when Kayman Sankar & Co. Ltd. (KSC) was first registered, with rice mills, a rice sheller, and a length grader installed in 1984. The Hampton Court facility was later further expanded to include drying facilities (replacing the earlier method of sun-drying), and increased storage, with Sankar eventually becoming Guyana's largest miller, exporting rice to other Caribbean countries and the European Union. He later expanded his business interests beyond rice, with KSC and another company, Kayman Sankar Investments Ltd. (KSIL) eventually combining to form the Kayman Sankar Group of Companies (KSG). In 1986, Sankar was nominated to sit in Guyana's National Assembly as a member of the People's National Congress (PNC), filling a casual vacancy left by Bissoondai Beniprashad-Rayman. He served until the 1992 election (which he did not contest), and was known as an advocate for the interests of rice farmers and other agricultural workers. A keen cricket enthusiast, Sankar was the inaugural president of the Essequibo Cricket Board, an affiliate of the Guyana Cricket Board. He sponsored local players and tournaments, and also established the Kayman Sankar Cricket Ground in Hampton Court, which often hosted the Essequibo cricket team and also several matches for the Guyanese national side. He was a noted philanthropist, and often helped poorer workers fund marriage ceremonies and funerals. Sankar died at his Hampton Court residence in February 2014, aged 87. He and his wife, Seraji (née Ramnauth, known as Mavis or Mae), had wed in Cornelia Ida in January 1945, when he was 17 and she was 13, in a coupling arranged by Seraji's aunt. The couple, who lived apart for the first two years of their marriage, had two daughters, Sita and Sattie, and a son, Beni, who played first-class cricket for Essequibo and later took over the running of KSG. Sankar was a devout Sanātanī Hindu throughout his life, and paid for several overseas swamis to visit Guyana."

  "text" : "Kim Un-yong or Un Yong Kim (born 3 March 1931) is a South Korean sports administrator and is the former Vice-President of the International Olympic Committee and founding member of the WTF executive board. Kim Un-yong was elected the president of the Korean Taekwondo Association on 23 January 1971. He received a doctorate in Political Science in 1963 from the Yonsei University. Kim retired from the WTF presidency in 2004 and was succeeded by Chungwon Choue. Kim Un-yong was elected the president of the Korean Taekwondo Association on 23 January 1971. Though he initially declined the position due to the continued conflicts within the organization, he was asked by the Korean government to accept and to clean up the association. Believing that Taekwondo was a Korean martial art and its governing body should therefore be based in Korea, Dr. Kim dissolved the relationship between the Korean Taekwondo Association and the International Taekwondo Federation. In 1973 the World Taekwondo Federation was formed and Dr. Kim was elected its first president. In 2004 Kim was jailed for corruption and was responsible for getting taekwondo in the Olympics. Kim has served as President of the President of the Korean Olympic Committee, President of the 2002 Pusan Asian Games Organization Committee, President of the Korea Taekwondo Association, President of World Taekwondo Headquarters (Kukkiwon), an Ambassador at Large with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Co-Chairman of the Rebuilding Korea Committee, and internationally, he was the President of GAISF, Executive Board Member of the IOC, Chairman of the IOC Radio and Television Commission, and President of the World Taekwondo Federation."

  "text" : "Kenneth Thomson (January 7, 1899 – January 26, 1967) was an American character actor active during the silent and early sound film eras. He, along with his wife Alden Gay, was a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild. The group was founded after meetings held at the Thomsons' home during 1933. During his brief twelve-year career in front of the camera, he appeared in over 60 films. After appearing in several Broadway plays during the early and mid-1920s, Thomson would make his film debut with a starring role in 1926's Risky Business. Over the next four years, he would appear in over a dozen films, in either starring or featured roles. In 1930 alone he would appear in ten films, half of which were in starring roles, such as Lawful Larceny, which also starred Bebe Daniels and Lowell Sherman (who also directed), and Reno, whose other stars were Ruth Roland and Montagu Love; the other half would see him in featured roles as in A Notorious Affair, starring Billie Dove, Basil Rathbone, and Kay Francis. During the rest of the 1930s, he would appear in numerous films, mostly in either supporting or featured roles, such as The Little Giant (1933), starring Edward G. Robinson and Mary Astor, and Hop-Along Cassidy (1935), starring William Boyd; although he occasionally would have a starring role, as in opposite Harold Lloyd in 1932's Movie Crazy."

This is believed to be the longest time that anyone has lived in this manner who then awoke without any residual symptoms. However, it has been claimed that Olsson may not really have been asleep and hibernating all that time. There were many unexplained characteristics of her state; for example, her hair, fingernails, and toenails did not seem to grow. Harald Fröderström observed in 1912 that she might have been pretending to sleep, or had been suffering from psychological problems and simply convinced herself that she was ill."

She is a professor of linguistics and serves as the Director of the Centre for Aboriginal Initiatives at the University of Toronto. She specializes in research on Slavey, a language spoken in Canada’s Northwest Territories. Well known for her work in both theoretical and Native American linguistics, Rice is working on a comparative grammar of Athapaskan languages that will detail the phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics as well as the lexicon of these languages. In addition, as a Canadian Research Chair, she researches markedness, contrast and complexity in phonology. On this topic she is working on a book to evaluate the diagnostics that have been proposed to determine markedness (giving special attention to frequency, implication and neutralization) and to examine phonological patterning. Rice served as president of the Canadian Linguistic Association from 1998 to 2002 and served as the president of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) in 2012."

He is a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, and a member of the Oxford Centre for Emotions and Affective Neuroscience (OCEAN) research group, and says \"I divide my time between lab-based research and popular writing.\" Before this post he was a research fellow at the Faraday Institute, St Edmund's College, University of Cambridge, and Visiting Professor for the Public Engagement with Psychological Science at the University of Essex. He gained his Ph.D. from the University of Essex in 2000 with the thesis title \"Minorities as symbols of uniqueness : a break from the norm\". He heads a research group on \"The Role of Personality Traits and Emotion Regulation Skills in Various Occupational Domains.\", and his research looks at the role of various \"personality traits and emotion regulation skills\" in different occupations such as \"politics, investment banking, surgery, and the military\", and whether action can be taken to enhance these characteristics \"to improve job performance and decision making in these occupations.\" He has written several popular books on psychopathy, and a review stated that \"his analysis tends to reinforce the idea that the chemistry of megalomania which characterises the psychopathic criminal mind is a close cousin to the set of traits often best rewarded by capitalism\". He has said that he wrote The Wisdom of Psychopaths \"as an attempt to figure out his dad\"; his father worked on a market stall and was \"ruthless, fearless and also extremely charming\". In his 2011 Great British Psychopath Survey he concluded that the ten professions that have the highest proportion of psychopaths are: 1.  \n*  CEOs 2.  \n*  Lawyers 3.  \n*  Media people (TV and radio) 4.  \n*  Sales people 5.  \n*  Surgeons 6.  \n*  Journalists 7.  \n*  Police officers 8.  \n*  Clergy 9.  \n*  Chefs 10.  \n*  Civil servants All of these careers require a strong degree of professional detachment. In the same year he featured in Channel 4's \"Psychopath Night\", and launched a survey to which 700,000 viewers responded. Among the conclusions: \"those with the least psychopathic traits preferred cats or kittens to many other pets while the most psychopathic individuals preferred pet fish.\" In October 2014 he appeared on BBC Radio 4's The Museum of Curiosity. His hypothetical donation to this fictional museum was \"a smile\"."

Together with his Bulgarian allies, he held the frontline until 15 September 1918, when the allies gained a crushing victory in the Battle of Dobro Pole and Bulgaria was forced to conclude an armistice. Von Steuben and his 11th Army had to withdraw behind the Danube into Hungary.After the German capitulation, they returned home on 8 December 1918.

He later transitioned to adult roles in 1981 with Let Us Love written by Kim Soo-hyun (and dropped out of Hanyang University's English Language and Literature department). Kang drew popularity when he starred in the family drama Under the Same Roof in 1986, but became best known for playing \"Dal-soo\" in the single-episode MBC Best Theater, which used his character to satirize the social issues of the day. The Trial of Dal-soo reached 25.7% viewership ratings, the highest in the anthology series' history. In 2000, Kang and his wife divorced on charges of adultery on her part, and his subsequent hospitalization from a heart attack led him to take a hiatus from his acting career and move with his son and daughter to England. He returned to Korea four years later, and made his comeback with People of the Water Flower Village. Kang is also an author of computer books for beginners, and in 2004 he published Oh! My God, a memoir about his life as a stay-at-home dad in Birmingham. In 2008, he played one of the leading roles in the spirit possession dramedy Who Are You?."

His grandmother was the noted weaver Ranginui Parewahawaha, who critiqued his 1st kete (basket) at the age of 112. He attributes his time as a weaver and guide at the Māori Arts and Crafts Institute in Rotorua as fundamental to his practice. He acknowledges Bubbles Mihinui, Mini Hohepa, Kura Raponui, Homai Balzer, Denny Anaru, Katiroa Tuhakaraina and Emily Schuster as major influences and teachers of fiber arts during his time there. Leonard, a teacher himself has lectured at Te Wananga o Raukawa between 2001-2010. Leonard pays close attention to detail and process, 'Everything is done by hand, from extraction to spinning to dying to weaving designs'. Nigel Borell writes that his works 'are complemented with natural dyes and dying techniques, giving the garments a dignity that is not complicated or contrived'. His works are held at The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and the Musical Instrument Museum (Phoenix) Arizona."
