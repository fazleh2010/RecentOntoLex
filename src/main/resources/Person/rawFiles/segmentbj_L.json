  "text" : "Lilli Hornig (née Lilli Schwenk; born March 22, 1921) is a Czech-American scientist who worked on the Manhattan Project, as well as a feminist activist. She was born in Ústí nad Labem in 1921. In 1929 her family moved to Berlin, and in 1933 she and her mother came to America, following her father who had moved there to escape the Nazis. She obtained her BA from Bryn Mawr in 1942 and her Ph.D. from Harvard in 1950. In 1943 she married Donald Hornig, and soon went with him to Los Alamos where he had obtained a job; after being originally asked to take a typing test, her scientific skills were recognized and she was given a job as a staff scientist for the Manhattan Project, in a group working with plutonium chemistry. Later it was decided that plutonium chemistry was too dangerous for women, and so she worked in high-explosive lenses instead. While at Los Alamos she signed a petition urging that the first atom bomb be used on an uninhabited island as a demonstration. Hornig later became a chemistry professor at Brown University and chairwoman of the chemistry department at Trinity College in Washington, D.C. She also was appointed by President Johnson as a member of a mission to the Republic of Korea that began the founding of the Korea Institute for Science and Technology. A feminist, she was the founding director of HERS (Higher Education Resource Services) under the auspices of the Committee for the Concerns of Women in New England Colleges and Universities first organized by Sheila Tobias. Hornig also served on equal opportunity committees for the National Science Foundation, the National Cancer Institute, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She also was the research chair of the Committee for the Equality of Women at Harvard, and consulted with and participated in many studies of women's science education and careers. She is the author of three books: Climbing the Academic Ladder: Doctoral Women Scientists in Academe, Equal Rites, Unequal Outcomes: Women in American Research Universities, and Women Scientists in Industry and Government: How Much Progress in the 1970's. She also translated From My Life. The Memoirs of Richard Willstätter from German into English. Hornig is a Life Trustee of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and was a trustee of the Wheeler School."

His son, Friedrich August Theodor Obbarius (1817–1855), was also a classical scholar. From 1808 he studied theology and philology at the University of Jena, where he was a pupil of Johann Jakob Griesbach, Johann Christian Wilhelm Augusti, Georg Ludwig Walch and Johann Philipp Gabler. After working as a private tutor for five years in Kelbra, he moved to Frankenhausen, where he served as subkonrektor at the Lyceum. In 1817 he was appointed \"collaborator\" to the local church ministry. In 1819 he became a professor at the gymnasium at Rudolstadt, a position he maintained up until his death. In 1842 he was awarded with an honorary degree from the University of Marburg, and in 1844 he became a member of the Societas Latina Jenensis (Latin Society of Jena)."

  "text" : "Lilian Turner (21 August 1867 – 25 August 1956), born Lilian Wattnall Burwell, was the elder sister of Ethel Turner and the daughter of Bennett George and Sarah Jane Burwell. Bennett George Burwell died when Lilian was still a young child, and her mother married a widower, Henry Turner, a year later. Both Lilian and Ethel would later take their step-father's name for their professional writing careers. Sarah and Henry had a daughter, Jeannie Rose (born 1873), but Henry died suddenly in 1878. The following year, Sarah took her three daughters to Australia, where she met and married Charles Cope in Sydney. Lilian and Ethel were educated at Sydney Girls' High School where they ran their own magazine, the Iris, in opposition to the Gazette, edited by Louise Mack. After leaving school the two sisters founded and co-edited a sixpenny monthly, the Parthenon, which lasted for three years. It was always the ambition of the two women to be novelists. Lilian's early novel The Lights of Sydney (1896) won first prize in a competition run by a London publisher, but the win lead nowhere. Her work was soon eclipsed by her younger sister's and, as Brenda Niall states: \"Accepting what she saw as a lesser aim, she turned to the 'flapper' novel: stories of love and ambition written for schoolgirls and young women.\" The World's News described Turner as \"a simple, wholesome, restful writer, upon whom it is a pleasure to fall back for stories for growing Australian girls to read.\" Turner was married on 22 February 1898 to Frederick Lindsay Thompson, a dentist, who was often out of work. The couple had two sons. She supported the family via her writing and over her career published a total of 25 novels. However, when she died on 25 August 1956 at Turramurra all of her novels were out of print."

  "text" : "Lewis Alfred Orford (12 March 1865 – 18 January 1948) was an English solicitor and a cricketer who played in seven first-class cricket matches for Cambridge University in 1886 and 1887. He was born in Cheetham Hill, Manchester and died in Crumpsall, also in Manchester. The son of a Manchester solicitor with whom he later went into partnership, Orford was educated at Uppingham School and Clare College, Cambridge. He was captain of cricket at Uppingham in 1883. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed batsman and wicketkeeper. At Cambridge, Orford was brought into the first eleven cricket team late in the university cricket season of 1886 and did well in his first game, against Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's, as a lower order batsman and wicketkeeper, scoring 29 in his only innings and making five catches and one stumping. In the 1886 University Match against Oxford University which followed this game, he was promoted to open the batting in the second innings. He played more regularly for the first team in 1887 but remained as a lower-order batsman, despite an innings of 76 when batting at No 10 in a high-scoring match against Sussex. The 1887 University Match was his final match in first-class cricket. Orford had graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1886, before his final season for the cricket team. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1890 and practised alongside his father and his older brother in Manchester."

  "text" : "Lidia Klement (Russian: Ли́дия Ри́чардовна Кле́мент; 8 July 1937, in Leningrad – 16 June 1964, in Leningrad) was a Soviet singer. She was involved with music and singing since childhood, studying piano at a music school for children and singing in a choir. Later, when studying at the Leningrad Institute of Civil Engineering, Lidia Klement sang in a student jazz ensemble. After graduation, she for two years worked as a design engineer and sang with the Naum Tyomkin Variety Orchestra at the Ordzhonikidze Palace of Culture. Since 1958 for about a year she sang with the ensemble of the Leningrad Comedy Theater. She was noticed and composers started writing songs especially for her. Lidia Klement gained fame all over the Soviet Union with songs such as \"Karelia\" (\"Карелия\"), \"Rain on Fontanka\" (\"Дождь на Фонтанке\"), \"Is All This for Me Alone?\" (\"Неужели это мне одной?\"). She performed a lot on radio and television, including on the extremely popular musical variety show Goluboy Ogonyok. In 1964, just several months before her death, she released a record with 9 songs on it (on Melodiya record label). At 26 years of age, at the peak of her career, she was diagnosed with sarcoma and soon died."

  "text" : "Larry L'Estrange MBE (12 November 1934 – 29 March 2007) was a British soldier and London Irish rugby player. As well as playing for London Irish (See London Irish#Notable former players) where he was awarded the 193-64 Backs Honour's tie, he also played for Sussex and the Territorial Army. He was capped once by Ireland (See List of Ireland national rugby union players) in 1962 against England at Twickenham. He was one of 9 new caps in that match. Sadly, he dislocated his finger during the game and is said to have had a 'ghastly' game. L'Estrange, who was born in Lytham, Lancashire, of Irish parents, was educated at Blackrock College, Dublin; the University of Chicago; and the Sorbonne in Paris. He then did National Service as a parachutist in Cyprus and Suez and was commissioned, before returning to Ireland to study modern history and political science at Dublin University. He also reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. His father, Laurence L'Estrange, was the Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Honduras during 1969–1972. In 1984, he made the news when he was mistakenly barred from entering Greece because he had a Turkish North Cyprus visa in his passport. After protesting to the Greek Embassy in London, he was given a full apology plus a return plane ticket and 2 weeks holiday in Greece for free. L'Estrange died on 29 March 2007 after being hospitalized for a broken hip in Condom, Gers, France. Due to complications, he died suddenly."

Weissenborn ran for Congress in 1972 unsuccessfully. He continued in his practice of law. Senator Weissenborn is probably best known for his efforts to move the state Capitol fromTallahassee to central FL.

The dismissal was one of many during the first eighteen months of Finney's administration, in which 10 cabinet posts were held by 21 people. Owen and her husband, former Kansas Lieutenant Governor Dave Owen, founded ICOP Digital, Inc., a business which engineered and marketed mobile video and digital surveillance products.

  "text" : "Louis Austin (1898-1971) was an African American journalist, leader and social activist. Austin purchased The Carolina Times in 1927 and transformed it into an institution that aided African Americans in their fight for freedom and equality in North Carolina. He used a new approach to Civil Rights issues in Durham, incorporating lower and middle class blacks, unlike the moderate, accommodationist approach of the black elite in Durham during this time. Austin's unusual strategy of advocating for the majority of blacks to have a voice in society succeeded in galvanizing a broader segment of the African American community in Durham to act for social change. Austin's approach to black activism helped lay the groundwork for the modern civil rights movement in Durham in the late 1950s and 1960s, which also encouraged lower-income blacks to become politically active. His strategies—which were once considered too radical by his peers—allowed Austin to maintain his influence in Durham well into the 1950s and 1960s. In doing so, Austin created a lasting impact for Durham."

In 1984, Sapinsley unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor, and soon became chairwoman of the Rhode Island Housing and Mortgage Finance Corporation (RIHMFC) a year later. After two years of working to improve the RIHMFC's reputation, she became the commissioner of the Public Utilities Commission, a title she held until here retirement in 1993. Even in retirement, Sapinsley served as a volunteered for the Providence Public Library; for Dorcas Place, a parent literacy center; as a co-chair of Senator John Chafee's campaign for re-election; and as president of the Wellesley College class of 1944. Sapinsley has served on the Board of Trustees for the American Civil Liberties Union, Butler Hospital, the Mental Health Association of Rhode Island, Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island, Temple Beth El and the Wellesley Center for Research on Women.

He was a professor of English philology at the University of Leningrad and later became a lecturer in Russian at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies. Following a stroke, she died at Finchley Memorial Hospital, Middlesex at the age of 55. Daniel Jones (1938:2) wrote in his obituary of her that she was one of the finest phoneticians in the world, and John Catford (1998:7) wrote that he thought her (1932) book was ″the best practical introduction to French phonetics.″"

He was initially an officer for the state of Min. In Min's last years, he rebelled against its last emperor Wang Yanzheng and seized control of the Fu Prefecture (福州, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) region, initially in nominal allegiance to both Southern Tang and Later Jin. When Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing tried to force to yield actual control to the Southern Tang imperial government, however, he turned his allegiance to Wuyue and fought off the Southern Tang attack with Wuyue aid. When his relationship with the Wuyue general Bao Xiurang (鮑修讓) eventually broke down, he considered killing Bao and resubmit to Southern Tang, but Bao discovered this and killed him first, allowing Wuyue to take actual control over the region."

  "text" : "Louis Payne, also known as Lou Payne, was an American character actor of the silent and sound film eras, as well as legitimate theater. His acting life began on Broadway in the first decade of the 1900s, when he would appear in the Broadway play, Her Majesty, the Girl Queen of Nordenmark, which ran at the Manhattan Theatre in 1900. In 1906, he married famous stage actress Mrs. Leslie Carter, fifteen years her junior, and would remain married to her until her death in 1937. He would make his film debut in 1915's Du Barry, which was a film created to highlight Carter, who was a protégé of the playwright David Belasco. Belasco wrote the stage play of the same name on which the film is based, and in which Carter starred on Broadway. Payne would appear in over 40 films during his 35 career in Hollywood, as well as doing numerous plays. In 1940, three years after Carter's death, Warner Bros. produced a biopic on her life, Lady with Red Hair, on which Payne would serve as a technical advisor. He would continue to act in small roles through the 1940s. The final film in which Payne appeared was 1951's epic Quo Vadis, starring Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr, in which he played one of Jesus' 12 apostles. Payne would die on August 14, 1953, at the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, California. He was buried with his wife at Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum in Dayton, Ohio."

  "text" : "Lars Kovala (originally Lauri Kovalainen) (b. 25 May 1818 in Oulu, Finland - 12 November 1894) acquired his schooling in Suomussalmi, Finland was a Finnish-born American businessman, merchant, fur trader, and investor coming from one of the most powerful families in Finland in the 19th century seeking Finnish Independence. He was the 3rd great grandfather of famous Finnish racing driver Heikki Kovalainen and father of Joonas Kovala, a founder of Onnela, Houghton County, Michigan, U.S.A. During the catastrophic Finnish famine of 1866–1868 he arrived in Alaska on board of one of the Russian American Co. ships. He entered the fur trade but seeing the decline of demand and in conjunction with the American takeover of Alaska, took advantage of the Russian American Co. equipment and properties being sold. Kovalainen invested in the Hansen, Nybom and Co. who managed to purchase one of the Russian American Co.'s brigs for $4,000. At the end of November the same year, Kovalainen and other shareholders sailed away in the brig. Their goal was the Pribilof Islands in the northern Pacific Ocean. That which lured them to the distant islands was the possibility of buying up valuable seal skins. Profiting from the seal skin trade he began investing in real estate in the Great Lakes region, Canada, and later expanded into the American West and Pacific coast. On the advice of corporate attorney Elbert Henry Gary, Kovala began investing in railroads. Even as a powerful businessman, he was deeply interested in improving the quality of life of his employees; this led to him becoming a philanthropist, pursuing many charitable causes. Lars Kovala, John D. Rockefeller and three others donated money to help create the national American Red Cross headquarters near the White House in Washington, D.C."

  "text" : "Li Hejun (Simplified Chinese 李河君) (born 1967) is a Chinese businessman, chairman of Hanergy. Li Hejun was born in 1967 to a Hakka family in Heyuan City, Guangdong Province. He graduated from Beijing Jiaotong University in 1988 with a BS (Bachelor of Science) degree in Mechanical Engineering. He started his doctoral studies at Cambridge University in Macro Economics from 2002. Li is now serving as the Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), a Delegate of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the Chairman of China New Energy Chamber of Commerce (CNECC), and the Board Chairman and CEO of Hanergy Holding Group. Li was ranked by New Fortune as the richest person of China in 2014 and 2015 with personal wealth of 13.4 billion and 25.5 billion USD respectively. In 2015, he was ranked China’s richest person by Hurun Report with 24.6 billion USD. In 1991, Li Hejun started Hanergy with 50,000 Yuan (approximately 8,000 USD), borrowed from his college teacher. After 20 years, Hanergy now is the world’s largest hydropower enterprise and also the world’s largest thin film solar enterprise. In his 20 years of entrepreneurship, he has accomplished two miracles of the Chinese business circle. The first one is that Li led a team of more than 10,000 members to construct a private 3GW hydropower station, Jin’anqiao hydropower station, starting from scratches. The hydropower station was over the Jinsha River in Yunnan Province of China, at an altitude of more than 2000 meters. It cost Li ten years (2002–2011) and more than 20 billion Yuan (3.5 billion US dollars). Jin’anqiao hydropower station is the world’s largest private hydropower station, 10% larger than that of the Gezhou Dam of China and 30% larger than the Hoover Dam of the United States. The second miracle is that, he led Hanergy to make massive strategic transition and industrial upgrade from 2010. From 2010 to 2015, Li led Hanergy to enter the thin film solar industry, which was not seen as a promising investment back then. Hanergy’s strategic transition took 6 years, with a total investment over 50 billion Yuan. Through 4 overseas M&As, Hanergy now ranks No. 1 globally in thin-film solar, in terms of output, technology, covering the whole industrial chain. While creating two miracles in Chinese history of economy, Li made an important strategic judgment that “being thin and flexible is the future of solar industry”. He believes that thin film solar is like artificial chlorophyll, enabling humans to utilize sunshine like green plants. Thin film solar is waging a new industrial revolution of energy production and consumption – and this upcoming industrial revolution is as profound as that of the internet. Thin film power is showing us to a mobile energy era, where we can generate and utilize power in a mobile way like we use mobile internet and mobile phones. Li Hejun is an advocate of new energy revolution. He and his company are dedicated to “changing the world by clean power”. In 2011, Li Hejun raised the concept of users “generating power for their own consumption and selling surplus to the grid.” This notion was affirmed by the Chinese government and enacted as a national policy, changing the landscape of the Chinese energy sector. In 2014, Li raised the concept of Mobile Energy for the first time in the world, which was highly appraised and recognized by the energy industry and beyond. He posits, “highly-efficient, flexible thin film solar technology enables us as humans to live without the traditional way of using fossil energy mostly by burning, instead, every person, even every item can generate power, and human society will enter an era characterized by distributed power generation.” In November 2013, Li Hejun published his first book, New Energy Revolution: the Power to Change China and the World. The book emphasizes that the nature of industrial revolutions is indeed energy revolution. In the future, competitions for energy will not be for resources, but core technology. During the meanwhile, this book systematically argues that “a combination of thin film power and internet will lead to the Third Industrial Revolution.”The English version of this book, China's New Energy Revolution, was published in 2014, receiving positive comments from all over the world. With his charisma and strategic vision, endurance and perseverance of ten tough years, and his dedication to dreams, Li is widely recognized as one of the Chinese entrepreneurs with the Most Respectable Entrepreneurship. Li also launched multiple philanthropic programs. As the one of the primary sponsors and the first executive director-general of the China Red Ribbon Foundation (a special fund for AIDS prevention and treatment in China), Li has made profound contributions to the programs of anti-AIDS, education, anti-desertification in China and poverty relief."

  "text" : "Lady Harriet Ashburton or Lady Harriet Mary Montagu (14 May 1805 – 4 May 1857) was a socialite and hostess. She was born in 1805 to George Montagu, 6th Earl of Sandwich and Louisa Montagu, Countess of Sandwich. She married William Bingham Baring, 2nd Baron Ashburton on 12 April 1823. He had graduated from Oriel College, Oxford in 1823 and he was an M.P. by 1826. He was the Member of Parliament for Thetford, Callington, Winchester, North Staffordshire and finally Thetford for a second time before he became a peer in 1848. He served in Sir Robert Peel's government despite his shyness. She was far from shy and more witty and direct and the welcome that she made at her various houses attracted leading men of her time. William Thackeray, John Stuart Mill and especially Thomas Carlyle enjoyed her company. She and the Earl of Sandwich were notably wealthy and they had houses in Surrey, Bath House, Piccadilly, another near Portsmouth and a place near Winchester. The Earl was involved in government, he was a fellow of the Royal Society, a trustee of the National Gallery and in 1860 he became President of the Royal Geographical Society. She was the hostess for, and a source of friction between, Thomas Carlyle and his wife, Jane Welsh Carlyle. Jane Carlyle was jealous of the attention that her husband gave to his hostess, but she was also one of her admirers. As a literary hostess, she had been described as chinless, large, and with an unusual nose, but both the Carlyles recognised her intelligence. Jane noted that despite her appearance she was \"almost beautiful—simply through the intelligence and cordiality of her expression.\" She died in Paris on 4 May 1857 having had only one child who died as an infant. Her husband married Louisa Caroline Baring at Bath House in Piccadilly on 17 November 1858."

  "text" : "Lockier Clere Burges (1841 – 7 January 1929), also known as L. C. Burges junior was prominent – and controversial – in Western Australia as an entrepreneur, explorer and author. Burges, the son of John Major Burges and Dorcas Bradshaw, was born at Fethard, County Tipperary, Ireland, in 1841. During the early 1860s, Burges emigrated to Western Australia, where he three of his uncles lived, including L. C. Burges senior (c. 1814–1886) and William Burges (c. 1807–1876). In 1868, L. C. Burges junior married Ann Eliza Finnerty at Fremantle. From late 1864, he worked for the Roebuck Bay Company (RBC) at the first, albeit short-lived station in the Kimberley, at Cape Villaret. In 1865, Burges took part in the La Grange expedition, which recovered the bodies of the explorers Panter, Harding and Goldwyer and explored the area between Cape Villaret and Lagrange Bay. The expedition was responsible for the killing up to 20 members of the Karajarri people. After the collapse of the RBC, Burges established Andover, a sheep station on the upper Harding River, in the Pilbara. Burges also invested in pearling vessels based in Nickol Bay. At the time, stations in North-West Australia were staffed almost entirely by local Aboriginal people who were paid in kind with \"rations\" (food and other goods) rather than money. In 1871, while droving sheep from the Pilbara to Geraldton, Burges shot and killed an Aboriginal man known only as \"Mackle-yell\", in a dispute over a stolen saddle.  He was convicted of manslaughter in 1872, and sentenced to five years imprisonment. The sentence was commuted to 12 months."

  "text" : "Levette J. Davidson was a nationally acclaimed expert in folklore, especially that of Colorado and the West. He was born in Eureka, Illinois May 16, 1894, one of four children. Because his grand uncle was past-President of Eureka College, a Christian seminary, Davidson was reared in the school's shadow with the option of becoming either a teacher or a preacher. He chose teaching and was awarded his B.A. from Eureka in 1915. A year later he received his A.M. degree from the University of Illinois where he received Phi Beta Kappa honors. In 1917 he earned his M.A. in social science and history at Harvard University. __During World War I, he served with the Tenth Infantry of the Forty-Sixth Division and also served as an army sergeant in Intelligence. Davidson and his wife Mary, also a graduate of Eureka, were married in 1918. At the end of the war, Davidson simultaneously taught and studied at the University of Michigan where he earned a Ph.D. in languages and literatures in 1922. He arrived in Denver later that year and began teaching at the University of Denver. Before arriving in Colorado, his academic specialty was eighteenth century England. Once in Denver, he realized that Western literature and folklore would be his life work. Davidson taught at the University of Denver until his death in 1957. His course topics ranged from studies of Shakespeare and other English literature, to folklore in the West. He began teaching news writing and eventually founded the journalism department at the University as well as the board of publications and the press club. He was the first faculty member elected to serve as president of the University Senate. In 1940 he became head of the English Department and from March to August 1953 he served as interim Chancellor. At the time of assuming his post, he remarked: There is hardly an organization on campus that I have not been connected with at one time or another. Davidson was named University Lecturer for 1956. Davidson was a director of the Colorado State Historical Society, the Modern Languages Association, the American Folklore Society, and the American Dialect Society. He was a charter member of the Denver Posse of the Westerners, an organization devoted to western folklore. In spare moments, Davidson conducted research, wrote outlines for plays, and authored a large number of articles. He contributed to a wide range of magazines from Western American to Shakespeare Quarterly. Additionally, Davidson authored several books on folklore. The most widely recognized is Rocky Mountain Tales, which presents regional folklore as well as true accounts of early events in the area. Levette Davidson died May 14, 1957."

Wheat's final film role would be in a small unbilled role in the 1947 film, Killer McCoy, starring Mickey Rooney, Brian Donlevy and Ann Blyth. Wheat died on August 7, 1963 in Los Angeles, California, and was buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery."

  "text" : "Ludegast (Leudegasius, Leodegar, Leudegarius, Lesio, Leonisius)) was bishop of Mainz in the early 7th century, succeeding Siegbert I. The Latinized name Leudegasius may be of East Germanic origin. He seems to have been a Burgundian. The period of his episcopate can only be roughly classified into the time around 610. In the quarrels between Theuderic II and Theudebert II in 611/612 he took part on the party of Theuderic. As the reason for this decision the Chronicle of Fredegar ascribes that he held Theudebert incompetent and desiderated Theuderics capability. The author of the Chronicle of Fredegar let him cite a fable to Theuderic, in order to prevent him from annihilation. For the period after the Merovingian brother war and the death of Theuderic in 613 documents may not be retrieved. Ludegast did not participate for unclear reasons at the Fifth Synod of Paris in 614. It may be assumed that he lost his bishopric due to the fall of Brunhilda."

A private student of Otto Frello, Andersen graduated from School of Visual Art. He describes himself as a Danish painter and writer. His video posted in November 2012 has gone viral across the web. Another one of his videos, A New Level of Archery, posted on YouTube in 2015, has received over 30 million views . In this video, Andersen demonstrates how to shoot while holding multiple arrows in his draw hand and shoot while on the move, jumping, close up, far away and hanging upside-down. However, many of the historical and scientific claims made in the video have been contested or discredited, and few of the ideas have gained traction with other archers and internet personalities.In April 2015, Lars responded to the claims against him and his technique. In the video Lars attempt to clarify his statements, some of which were in agreement with arguments against some of his original videos claims, mainly that this style was forgotten or he re-invented it, but some of them refuting the criticism against him, such as the texts he refers to in his video do not included the topic of speed shooting and the archer paradox."

  "text" : "Lazarus Leonard Aaronson MBE (18 February 1895 – 9 December 1966), often published as L. Aaronson, was a British poet and a lecturer in economics. As a young man, he belonged to a group of Jewish friends who are today known as the Whitechapel Boys, many of whom later achieved fame as writers and artists. Though less radical in his use of language, he has been compared to his more renowned Whitechapel friend, Isaac Rosenberg, in terms of diction and verbal energy. Aaronson's poetry is characterised as more post-Georgian than modernistic, and reviewers have traced influences from both the English poet John Keats, and Hebrew poets such as Shaul Tchernichovsky and Zalman Shneur. Aaronson lived most of his life in London and spent much of his working life as a lecturer in economics at the City of London College. In his twenties, he converted to Christianity and a large part of his poetry focused on his conversion and spiritual identity as a Jew and an Englishman. In total, he published three collections of poetry: Christ in the Synagogue (1930), Poems (1933), and The Homeward Journey and Other Poems (1946). Although he did not achieve widespread recognition, Aaronson gained a cult following of dedicated readers. Upon retiring from teaching, he moved to Harpenden, Hertfordshire, where he died from heart failure and coronary heart disease on 9 December 1966. His poetry was not widely publicised, and he left many unpublished poems at his death."

Born in Livorno, Squarzina studied in Rome, at the Liceo Classico Tasso, where he had Vittorio Gassman as classmate. He got a degree cum laude in Law, then he graduated as a director at the Silvio d’Amico Academy of Dramatic Arts. He debuted as a stage director in 1944 with an adaptation of Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men. In 1949, Squarzina debuted as a playwright with The Universal Exhibition, which was never represented in Italy due to censorship. After directing the Teatro Ateneo in Rome, in 1952 he co-founded with Vittorio Gassman the Teatro d'arte italiano (\"Italian Theatre of Art\"). Squarzina later directed the Teatro Stabile in Genoa between 1972 and 1976 and later the Teatro Stabile in Rome, from 1976 to 1983. Squarzina was also active as a scholar and as a director of the theater section of the Encyclopedia of Performing Arts by Silvio D'Amico. He was also an occasional actor, and for his debut performance in Francesco Rosi's The Mattei Affair he won the Silver Ribbon for best new actor."
