His father was a captain in the United States Army. In 1886 or '87, the family moved east when his father was transferred. Melvin Jones settled in Chicago, where he studied at the Union Business and Chaddock Colleges of Quincy, Illinois. At age 33 he was the sole owner of his own insurance agency in Chicago and became a member of the local business circle, and was elected secretary shortly thereafter. Melvin Jones was also a Freemason. After two years, prompted by his personal code – \"You can't get very far until you start doing something for somebody else\" – Jones proposed that the talents of the circle's members could be better utilized in other areas of community life, He invited representative from other men's clubs in and around Chicago to a meeting to devise a suitable organization; from this meeting Lions Clubs International was formed on June 7, 1917. Jones eventually gave up his insurance agency to work full-time at Lions International Headquarters in Chicago. In 1945, Jones represented Lions Clubs International as a consultant at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco . In 1950, Lions International acknowledged Jones' contributions to the organization by awarding him the title of Secretary General for life. In 1961 the International Board of Directors proclaimed January 13 (the birthday of Melvin Jones) as a day of memory each year throughout the world of Lionism."

Her works of fiction were informed by her literary scholarship but also had a distinctly autobiographical vein, particularly her Voci del nord-est (1986) and II canto delle sirene (1989). For most of her career she was based at the University of Pavia where she established the Fondo Manoscritti di Autori Moderni e Contemporanei, an extensive curated archive of material on modern Italian writers."

Mills is known for his use of wood, glass, and stone. Imagination aided by a background in architectural engineering allowed him to push boundaries beyond other architects of his time. His designs were guided by his desire to use local materials, recyclable manufactured pieces, and wood as close to its original form as possible."

According to the Supreme Court of California, \"The issue concerning the guilt or innocence of the defendant of the crime of grand larceny in obtaining said sums of money from Dabney, and appellant's defense thereto, turned largely upon the question of good faith and actual belief of the defendant in the truth of the representations made to Dabney, and which induced Dabney to pay over the money. There was substantial evidence in favor of the prosecution, but also there was substantial evidence in favor of the defendant upon that issue.\" The Supreme Court of California further stated that, \"Criminal statutes which prescribe punishment for false representations primarily were intended to protect persons against those who report falsely with respect to their earthly and material possessions. Any legislative attempt to limit or regulate persons in their claims to the possession of exceptional spiritual power or knowledge would be rejected as a dangerous invasion of the state into the realm of religious freedom and privilege, which, from the beginning of our government, has been guarded by constitutional barriers.\" The court implied that \"mentally healthy\" people are responsible for their decisions to associate themselves with religious orders and \"chimerical delusions\" such as the one created by May Otis Blackburn."

  "text" : "Max van Berchem (16 March 1863, Geneva – 7 March 1921, Vaumarcus) was a Swiss epigraphist and historian. Best known as a pioneer of Arabic epigraphy, he created \"Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum\", an impressive collection of Arabic inscriptions. He studied at the Universities of Geneva, Leipzig, Strasbourg and Berlin, receiving his degree in 1886 with the dissertation La propriété territorial et l'impôt sous les premiers califes. After graduation, he embarked on scientific expeditions to Egypt (several trips from 1887 to 1890), Jerusalem and Palestine (1888, 1893 and 1914), and Syria (1884, 1895). On these journeys he studied and collected a vast amount of Arabic inscriptions (\"Matériaux pour un Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum\"). Being aware of the enormity of this project, he divided the work amongst others, mostly French and German scholars, with Berchem, for the most part, limiting his personal investigations to the cities of Cairo, Jerusalem and Damascus. In his work, he used photography as a means to record Arabic inscriptions. Between 1895 and 1914, he dedicated most of his time and energy towards the publication of the large amount of textual material that he had accumulated. Since 1973 the \"Max van Berchem Foundation\" has financed archaeological excavations, research projects and studies in Islamic art and architecture throughout the Middle East and north Africa."

  "text" : "Mir Quasem Ali (31 December 1952 – 3 September 2016) was a Bangladeshi businessman, philanthropist and politician. He was a former director of Islami Bank, and chairman of the Diganta Media Corporation, which owns Diganta TV. He founded the Ibn Sina Trust and was a key figure in the establishment of the NGO Rabita al-Alam al-Islami. He was considered to be the wealthiest member of the Bangladeshi political party Jamaat-e-Islami. He was sentenced to death on 2 November 2014 for crimes against humanity committed during the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971 by International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh. The charges were denied by his relatives, stating they were politically motivated. Rights groups also raised concerns about these cases, with Amnesty International criticizing the use of the death penalty and saying Mir Quasem Ali’s trial had been unfair. He was hanged at Gazipur on 3 September 2016  after his final appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh."

Having the prestige to represent his nation in two Olympic Games, Aquilina has been nominated several times as the Sailor of the Year by the Malta Sailing Federation. Aquilina made his official debut, as a lone sailor, at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he placed thirty-seventh in the Laser class with a remarkable grade of 272, surpassing Singapore's Stanley Tan by a three-point advantage. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Aquilina qualified for his second Maltese team, as a 29-year-old, in the Laser class by granting a tripartite invitation from the International Sailing Federation. Unlike his previous Olympics, Aquilina could not upgrade his position with a net score of 339 points and a thirty-ninth-place effort in a fleet of forty-two sailors."

  "text" : "Mildred Esther Mathias (1906-1995) was an American award-winning botanist. Beginning her college career in the 1920s, she originally had planned to study mathematics. But she instead studied botany, getting her bachelor's, master's degree and PhD at Washington University in St. Louis. She studied, classified, and led groups to discover plants across the world, from Southeastern Asia to Australia, to South-Central Africa, to the Amazons, to the western United States. She discovered over 100 types of Umbelliferae, or carrots. Her research was so revered, she had a genus, the Mathiasella, named in her honor. She had a huge emphasis on education for the general public, both directing the UCLA botanical garden (which was then renamed the Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden in her honor) and hosting a weekly television show on gardening. She published over 100 articles and books about her findings. She was a voice of conservation in Costa Rica, creating the Organization for Tropical studies, helping with preservation of Costa Rican lands. She also helped establish the U.S. National Reserve System. Along with all this, she was a professor at UCLA from 1962 until 1974. She was also president of the American Society for Plant Taxonomists, and the Botanical Society of America. The standard author abbreviation Mathias is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name."

His notability is enhanced by the marriage, in 1953, of his elder sister Margot to a political high-flyer called Erich Honecker. As a result of this, between 1971 and 1989 Manfred Feist found himself the brother in law of East Germany's de facto head of state. Over the years he was subjected to greater media scrutiny than would normally have been applied to political functionaries at his level of competence: his tongue-in-cheek soubriquet \"Manny the Great\" (\"Manni der Große\") allegedly used by colleagues, was publicized even in West Germany."

Maurice was known as an aviation and motor car enthusiast, a friend to the Wright brothers. He served as a Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the First World War after which he was granted some land in Ngata area near Nakuru in Kenya under the Soldier Settlement Scheme. He later purchased a further 21,000 acres around the same area from Lord Delamere. On this land, he founded a school in 1939 named Egerton Farm School (now Egerton University). The school was meant to prepare white European youth for careers in agriculture. Maurice did not marry and on his death in 1958 the barony became extinct, and Tatton Park was given to the National Trust."

In 1980, 19-year-old DeFriest retrieved work tools his recently deceased father had willed him before the will officially went through probate. This act was considered theft and his stepmother called the police, which led to his arrest. DeFriest was sentenced to four years in prison, even though five out of six court-appointed psychiatrists reported that he was mentally ill (the sixth would later change his mind and support his appeal). The original four-year sentence has since developed into 34 years for 13 escape attempts—seven of them successful—and hundreds of disciplinary reports for minor infractions. In 34 years, he’s collectively spent 27 of them in solitary confinement."

She is probably most known for the song \"Stoyat Devchonki\" (\"Стоят девчонки\", composed by Alexander Kolker) and for her version of \"School Waltz\" (\"Школьный вальс\"). The song that brought her fame was \"Kachaet, Kachaet...\" (\"Качает, качает...\") that she recorded for the theater play Idu na Grozu (\"Иду на грозу\") in 1963. It was the first solo song she ever recorded and it took a lot of effort by her future husband, composer Aleksander Kolker, to persuade her to do it. Maria Pakhomenko owed much of her popularity to songs written by Kolker (who is probably most famous for writing the song \"Karelia\" for Lidia Klement). Some of the titles he wrote for her are \"Опять плывут куда-то корабли\", \"Печальная\", \"Красивые слова\", \"Стоят девчонки\", \"Чудо-кони\". Among the songs by leading Soviet composers of which she was the original performer are \"Lyubov Ostanetsya\" (\"Love Will Stay\", by Valery Gavrilin), \"Nenaglyadnyy Moy\" (by Aleksandra Pakhmutova), \"Muzhchiny\" (\"Mens\", by Eduard Kolmanovsky), \"Razgovory\" (\"Conversations\", by Eduard Khanok), \"Vals pri Svechakh\" (by Oscar Feltsman), etc."

In her dramas, Moon often delves into the harsh realities of married life with candidness and wit, and her style has been consistently popular with local audiences, resulting in high viewership ratings for Famous Princesses (2006), First Wives' Club (2007), Three Brothers (2009) and Wang's Family (2013)."

  "text" : "Mahienour El-Massry (born 1986) is an Egyptian human rights lawyer and political activist from Alexandria, who has been engaged on the activist scene in the coastal city since the mid 2000s, and is currently serving a prison sentence for her anti-regime activities. She has been organizing peaceful protests and supports activities for political prisoners, using social media to denounce human rights violations. Often dubbed as a voice of the revolution and a champion of women’s rights, her activism covered a wide range of activities, as an Alexandrian scholar and friend notes: \"There was not a single struggle that was off limits for Mahienour: human rights, student rights, women’s rights, labor strikes, legal aid, anti-police brutality, housing for the poor, corruption, anti-military trials, heritage preservation, right to the public space, state-led land reclamation from the poor, climate change, street children’s rights, Syrian refugees; the list goes on...Mahienour was always there, sleeping next to Syrian refugees in police stations to ensure they did not get tortured or deported, advocating for the twenty-one female supporters of the Brotherhood who were sentenced (and later acquitted) to eleven years in jail, and locating missing persons through the security labyrinth. Mahienour would rush to defend the victim’s rights—regardless of affiliation—and attend the funeral of people she had never met. Her very presence sent a message that this issue really mattered and raised protestors’ morale.\"El-Massry was sentenced to two years in prison for violating Egypt’s controversial protest law before having her sentence reduced to six months. The young activist had participated in a protest on December 3, 2013 to call for justice and retribution for Khaled Saeed, the man who was tortured to death in June 2010 and later became one of the symbols of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. She was released in September 2014, only to be sentenced on a different charge, in May 2015, when under the Morsi presidency, El-Massry and a group of lawyers started a sit-in in front of El-Raml police station in Alexandria, demanding an official apology from the Ministry of Interior regarding the injury of their fellow lawyer at the hands of police personnel. The lawyers were then arrested and accused of attempting to break into the police station. An acquittal hearing for El-Massry and her colleagues was made in December 2015 but was unsuccessful. In June 2014, El-Massry was awarded the Ludovic Trarieux International Human Rights Prize, an international honour given annually to a lawyer for contributions to the defence of human rights. She was the second person to be awarded the international award while in prison since Nelson Mandela in 1985."

  "text" : "When Mareshia Rucker was a high school senior in 2013 at Wilcox County High School in Georgia, USA, she led efforts to get her high school to hold a single, racially integrated, senior prom.Previously her high school had only allowed students to attend racially segregated parties. Her struggles brought world-wide attention on her school, and on Rucker, personally.Rucker was interviewed by Amy Goodman on National Public Radio on April 27, 2013.Rucker disputed assertions by local politicians that there was no support for a desegrated party within the student body. Mitch Potter, writing in the Toronto Star, reported that Rucker and her friends encountered considerable local opposition to the idea of an integrated prom.Not only wouldn't the local school board make space available, they wouldn't even sign a general letter of support for the idea of an integrated party.Potter described Mareshia as coming from a strong family, still considered newcomers to rural Rochelle, Georgia, even though her grandmother moved her family there decades ago. Jamie Gumbrecht, of CNN characterized Mareshia as a good student, and reported that she participated in the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, a program the American military has to turn patriotic students into members of its military reservist program. In November, 2014, Rucker was invited to the opening of an exhibit at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, celebrating her efforts.Rucker's prom dress was the center of the exhibit. CBC News reports that a crowdfunding campaign supplied the funds to pay for the trip of Rucker and four of her relatives, who were guests of honour at several events."

  "text" : "Marshall Ho'o (1910 - 1993) was an American practitioner of t'ai chi ch'uan. Ho'o was born in 1910 in Oakland, California, and in his youth campaigned on behalf of trade unions. Having previously studied t'ai chi with Choy Hok Pang, Ho'o rediscovered the art in his 50s whilst on a health retreat in Mexico. After this, he began teaching as an assistant of Wen-Shang Huang, one of his early instructors. The two of them founded the National T'ai Chi Association, a loose affiliation of t'ai chi schools, in 1962. In 1967, Huang left to teach at a university in China, leaving Ho'o in sole charge of the Association. On his return to China, Huang sponsored a teaching visit to America by Dong Huling to provide instruction to his American students. In 1973, Ho'o founded the Aspen Academy of the Martial Arts, a centre for the study of martial arts located in Aspen, Colorado. He held the post of professor of Oriental History at the California Institute of the Arts, and was Chairman of the National T'ai Chi Ch'uan Association. Ho'o was a licensed acupuncturist, and a member of the Black Belt Magazine Hall of Fame. He developed his own form of t'ai chi, extracting movements from a number of different styles. His approach stressed the health benefits of t'ai chi, and focussed on exercises to relax and soften the body. Ho'o died in 1993, survived by his seven children."

She had been beaten in the head and chest with a hammer, ax, and lamp. Pfister has been described as having been a \"small-town socialite\" and was well known in her small community. In October 2014, Trey and Nancy Styler, Pfister's former roommates were charged with the crime. Shortly thereafter, Trey Styler confessed to her murder, and received life imprisonment in exchange for the charges against his wife to be dropped. Styler claimed he killed Pfister as \"punishment\" for adding an interest rate to the couple's rent after they refused to pay for over three months. The Stylers had stopped paying rent after living with Pfister for 2 months, due to minor broken utilities in the home that she refused to fix."

  "text" : "Matthaeus Greuter (1564–1638), known in Italian as Matteo Greuter, was a German etcher and engraver who worked in Rome. He is known for his cartographical prints. Born in Strasbourg, Greuter worked in France, in Avignon and Lyon. Apparently to escape the \"strong intellectual and commercial pressure of Dutch cartographic publishing\", in 1606 he went to Rome where he produced works for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, Pope Paul V, for the Accademia dei Lincei, and Pope Urban VIII. Greuter is best known for his plans and maps. He created architectural prints depicting Villa Mondragone, Villa Parisi and other notable buildings. He also produced a large number of maps, most notably those designed to be used for globes. His first globe map of the world was created in 1632 and was dedicated to Jacobo Boncompagno. It was based on an earlier globe by Willem Blaeu. The inclusion of Hokkaido indicates that he updated the design to take account of new discoveries, as the island was not known to Blaeu, but was documented by another map maker in Rome.\" He made a \"celestial globe\" depicting the constellations in 1635, also based on Blaeu, who had used the data of Tycho Brahe. Again he appears to have updated the globe. He also designed reduced-size globes between 1636 and 1638. Other works were book frontispieces, portraits and allegorical designs. His satirical print of \"Doctor Wurmbrandt\" purging human follies was later adapted by Martin Droeshout."

  "text" : "Mohamed Fadel Fahmy (Arabic: محمد فاضل فهمي‎‎  pronounced [mæˈħæmmæd ˈfɑːdˤel ˈfæhmi]; born April 27, 1974) is an Egyptian-born Canadian award-winning journalist, war correspondent and author. Fahmy has worked extensively in the Middle East, North Africa, for CNN, BBC and Al Jazeera English. He covered the Iraq War in 2003 for the Los Angeles Times and entered Iraq on the first day of the war from Kuwait. Upon completion of his one-year mission, he authored his first book, Baghdad Bound. Most recently, he covered the Arab Spring. In September 2013, he accepted a new post as the Al Jazeera English International Bureau Chief based in Egypt. On 29 December 2013, he and two colleagues Al Jazeera English journalists, Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed, were arrested by Egyptian authorities. On 23 June 2014, Fahmy was found guilty by a Cairo Criminal Court and sentenced to seven years of incarceration at the Tora Prison, a maximum security prison. On 1 January 2015 the Egyptian Court of Appeals announced a retrial for Fahmy, Mohamed and Greste. Release on bail was not allowed. He renounced his Egyptian citizenship on 3 February 2015. to benefit from a presidential executive order allowing the deportation of foreign prisoners. His colleague Peter Greste was deported to Australia. On 12 February 2015 both Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were released on bail and referred to a six-month long retrial. On 29 August 2015, Fahmy, Mohamed and Greste each received three year sentences from the retrial judge. Greste was sentenced in absentia. On 23 September 2015, it was reported that Fahmy was pardoned by the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. In a BBC HARDtalk interview shortly after his release, he criticized Al Jazeera English's decision to take the Egyptian government to court for cancelling its network license. He also confirmed that he is suing Al Jazeera English for \"100 million dollars\" for \"damages.\" The Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi restored his Egyptian citizenship on June 10, 2016. Fahmy started his new job as an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia upon winning his freedom and returning to Vancouver, Canada. He authored a book about his imprisonment in Egypt titled The Marriott Cell: An Epic Journey from Cairo's Scorpion Prison to Freedom The book was adapted into a screenplay written by Michael Bronner."

Schmeitzner was born in the southern part of what was then the German Democratic Republic. His 1968 birth year meant that his university-level education straddled the events that led to German reunification in the second half of 1990. He successfully completed his schooling in Dresden at the \"Friedrich Engels Extended Secondary School (EOS) - Dresden south\" in 1987 and then, in 1987/88, worked for VEB Robotron, a large electronics manufacturing operation. He then returned to academe, studying History, German Language, Culture and Linguistics and Education, initially at Dresden's Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wander Pedagogical Academy and then at the Dresden University of Technology. His work has focused on the History of the \"Weimar Republic\", of the Third Reich, of the Soviet occupation zone (SBZ / Sowjetische Besatzungszone) in what had previously been Germany, and on the formative years of the German Democratic Republic which grew out of it. He has also undertaken extensive historical research into nineteenth and twentieth century Parliamentary structures, Youth movements and left-wing Totalitarianism. He is a member of various academic bodies including the advisory board of the Saxony Memorials Foundation and of the Friedrich Ebert Memorial House. He is also a member of the Editorial board for the quarterly journal: \"Dresdner Hefte. Beiträge zur Kulturgeschichte\"."

The Columbia Journalism Review included her exposes among its business must-reads for 2012. She was on the Media Industry Newsletter’s Person to Watch list in 2012. She joined Bloomberg News in 2013 as an enterprise reporter. Her profiles of business executives Doug Oberhelman of Caterpillar, in a piece titled King Kat, and Sears executive Eddie Lampert, in a piece titled The Sun Tzu at Sears, won her the Front Page Award for business reporting. She was offered a position by ESPN editors after she wrote an essay on Tumblr about a \"bond between herself and her dad and the Seattle Seahawks;\" she is an avid fan of that team. She wrote about young sports superstars such as University of Houston basketball player Devonta Pollard, who got mixed up in a family dispute and, at one point, testified against his own mother. She wrote about football star Ray Rice, \"tattoos and fandom\", the underrepresentation women in executive positions in Major League Baseball, and other subjects. She appeared as a guest on sports-related broadcasts. In 2015, she was hired to write a column for ESPN The Magazine."

After the death of the Fifth President of the Republic of Zambia Mr Michael Chilufya Sata who happens to have been Miles Sampa's Uncle, Miles Sampa was unduly elected as President of the party at a controversial Patriotic Front general conference.His election was later deemed illegal by the courts of law and Edgar Lungu who would later become republican President was declared the rightful PF president.Miles was later appointed as commerce deputy Minister in Edgar Lungu's government though he resigned and left PF shortly before the 2016 general election. Sampa attempted to form Democratic Front but the name already belonged to another party. After deliberating and searching for a party name, his party was registered as United Democratic Front UDF. Sampa went on to enter alliances with Political lightweights such as Elis Chipimo's NAREP and Eric Chanda's 4th Revolution Party before eventually throwing hos weight behind Hakainde Hichilema and UPND. As expected, UPND went on to lose the election and after reflecting on what hunger waited ahead for him, Sampa went back to beg to rejoin PF."

  "text" : "Marjorie Patterson (May 13, 1891 – March 11, 1948) was an American author and actress in the early 20th century. Her works included the novels Fortunata (1911), The Dust of the Road (1913), about her experiences acting in London, and A Woman's Man (1919). Publishers Weekly provided this summary of Fortunata in 1911: \"Fortunata is the granddaughter of an old Roman Princess and lives in a great Roman palace. When about 18 she begins to have her own way. She spends money lavishly, associates with most unhealthy companions for a young girl. Finally she drifts to England and marries a very rich man and is forced to live with his hum-drum mother and daughters. The Italian wife remains erratic and the end is tragedy.\" H.L. Mencken gave the book a positive review. Patterson's theatre roles included playing the title role in Pierrot the Prodigal (which played at the Booth Theatre in New York and was produced by Winthrop Ames and Walter Knight), and in the one-act Pan in Ambush, which she wrote. She also acted for a few years in England. Reporting on her in the 1910s places her birth year around 1891, though it is likely she was a few years older as it was not uncommon for actresses to claim a younger age. Attention to her doings dropped off by about 1922, and there is little subsequent mention of her after that time. Patterson was the only daughter of Wilson Patterson and Margaret Sherwood. Her grandfather was author and critic John Neal, and her great-aunt was Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte, sister-in-law of Napoleon."

Between 1780 and 1784 he served as a seaman and midshipman in the Royal Navy. After leaving the navy he sailed as a seaman on trading voyages to India and China before becoming owner and captain of a ship trading between India and Europe. In 1789 Hogan married Frances Richardson, the illegitimate daughter of William Richardson, a trader that Hogan engaged in business with out of Bombay, and his at least partially ethnically Indian housekeeper, Anna Marie Lacy. Under the command of Hogan, Marquis Cornwallis departed Cork, Ireland on 9 August 1795, carrying 163 male and 70 female convicts. She also carried 36 soldiers of the New South Wales Corps, and their families. About a month into the voyage Hogan had to put down a mutiny, with the result that seven convicts and a sergeant, one of the mutineers, died of their injuries, including flogging. Marquis Cornwallis then stayed for almost a month at the Cape, re-provisioning. She arrived at Port Jackson on 11 February 1796. In all, 11 male convicts died during the course of the voyage. Hogan settled his family in New York in 1802, but continued to trade in various ships with Valparaíso, Chile and other south Pacific ports. From 1815-1817 Hogan was US consul at Cork in Ireland. From 1819-1820 he was US consul at Havana, Cuba. In 1823 he was appointed U.S. Consul and Navy Agent at Valparaíso. He held this position until his death. Hogan was involved in business enterprises in upstate New York, particularly in what became Bombay, New York. However he generally lived in New York City. He seems to have resided in Watertown, New York for some period of time. In New York City Hogan had a 100-acre estate positioned along the Hudson River with 107th Street as its southern edge. He named his house Claremont, and it later became the Claremont Inn. He died in 1833 at Washington, District of Columbia. His son William Hogan was a United States Representative from New York from 1831 to 1833. The Hogan Group of islands in Bass Strait in between the Australian mainland and Tasmania is named after him."

  "text" : "Mihal Turtulli (1847–1935), also known as Michal Tourtoulis or Dr. Turtulli, was an Albanian oculist, politician, member of High Council of State (Jan - Dec 1920), and representative of Albania in the Paris Peace Conference, 1919. M.Turtulli was born in Korçë, Ottoman Empire. His family originated in Vithkuq and had settled in Korçë circa 1823. He was practically raised in El-Fayyūm, Egypt being part of the Albanian colony there. He graduated from the Lycée Al-Horreya of Alexandria. During the period 1876-1885, he studied medicine in Greece and later in France, where he became and oculist. He returned to Egypt in 1885 and worked as a physician in Cairo's hospitals until 1912. Following the Albanian Declaration of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in November 1912, he returned to Albania.Turtulli was a supporter of Prince Wied for the Albanian throne. He was part of the delegation that went to Neuwied, Germany to offer the crown to Wied. He was elected Minister of Health and Education in the provisional government of Turhan Pasha Permeti on May 20, 1914. He spent most of the period until 1918 in Lausanne, Switzerland. During this time, he was active in the Albanian patriotic press where he advocated total unity between social and regional communities of Albania. While in Switzerland, together with Pandeli Cale and Sotir Kolea, he published the periodical L'Albanie, which went out during 1915-1919.On June 3, 1917, with his initiative, Vatra, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America held a fundraising congress in order to support the diplomatic activities of Albania in the processes following WWI. Turtulli was the first to donate, with an amount of $1,000. In his telegram, he urged all members of Albanian-American diaspora to donate $10. This was the first fundraising event of Vatra, for this purpose.In 1918, he was elected Representative of Vatra to establish contacts with the Albanian community of Italy and Italian authorities, in the eve of Congress of Durres. Due to his non pro-Italian stance, he was substituted by Mehmet Konica. Turtulli participated in the Congress of Durres (Dec 25-27, 1918), and was elected Minister without portfolio in the government that came out of it. In 1919, he represented Albania in the Paris Peace Conference. He strongly advocated the unity of Albanian nation against the stance of Alexandros Karapanos who represented the Greeks of Northern Epirus (South Albania) claiming that the region should be ceased to Greece and that was the will of the Orthodox population, by stating: \"I am from Korça. I have worked as a doctor in that town. I say there are no Greeks in Korça, not even in Korça area. Greece stirs things up. They think that the Christians, like me, are Greek. This is not correct. It is pretended that all the Orthodox people are Greek. Why? Russians, Bulgarians, Serbs, even being Orthodox they are not Greek\". M.Turtulli was a delegate at the Congress of Lushnja of 1920, and was elected member of the High Council of State as representative of the Albanian Orthodox population, along with Luigj Bumci for the Catholic, Aqif Pasha Elbasani for the Bektashi, and Abdi Bey Toptani for the Muslim. In April 1921, he stopped participating in the Council's activities, and retired from completely in 1922, following the allegations of Bumci's and Aqif Pasha Elbasani's involvement in a coup d'etat against Ahmet Zogu's government. He left Albania in December 1924 after the suppression of the June Revolution. Though he went back to Egypt, unlike most of the anti-Zogist personalities who fled the country, he affiliated himself with KONARE (The National Revolutionary Committee) foounded by Fan Noli in Vienna. Meanwhile, Zogu's government had him on the black list, and he was sentenced in absentia to 101 years, but he was included in an amnesty of 1927. Turtulli returned shortly to Albania, and then back to Egypt where he lived his final years."

A son of Adele Lessona by an earlier marriage was the painter and malacologist Carlo Pollonera, with whom Mario published a monograph on Italian slugs. Mario also coauthored various scientific works with his brother-in-law, the zoologist and senator Lorenzo Camerano."

  "text" : "Mateni Tapueluelu is a Tongan journalist and politician. He has worked as a correspondent for Radio New Zealand International in Tonga, then became editor of the Keleʻa, the newspaper of the pro-democracy movement and of the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands, led by his father-in-law ʻAkilisi Pohiva. Tapueluelu's wife Laucala, Pohiva's daughter, is the newspaper's publisher. In 2013, he was fined T$ 130,000 for having published in Keleʻa a letter to the editor found to have defamed members of the government. Tapueluelu and his wife published an editorial criticising the ruling, whereupon they were found to be in contempt of court, and subjected to an additional fine of T$2,700. In the build-up to the 2014 general election, the Democratic Party suffered a split, de-selecting several of its own sitting members of the Legislative Assembly. Among those de-selected was Semisi Tapueluelu, MP for Tongatapu 10 and Mateni Tapueluelu's father. Under Mateni Tapueluelu's lead, Keleʻa published allegations of a sex scandal against his father. In the election in November, Semisi Tapueluelu lost his seat to the party's endorsed candidate in his constituency, while Mateni Tapueluelu was elected MP for Tongatapu 4. In so doing, he defeated incumbent MP and long-time key party figure ʻIsileli Pulu, who had also been de-selected and had therefore stood as an independent. In December 2015 Tapueluelu's election was annulled by the Supreme Court on the grounds of unpaid fines owing from the 2013 criminal libel case."

  "text" : "Mehtab (1918–1997) was a popular Indian actress of Hindi/Urdu films who worked from 1928-1969. She was born in Sachin, Gujarat, to a Muslim family and named Najma. Her father, Sedee Abraham Khan, was the Nawab of Sachin, near Surat in the state of Gujarat. Starting her career in the late 1920s with small roles in films like Second Wife (1928), Indira B. A. (1929), and Jayant (1929) she went on to do character roles before acting in the lead opposite Ashraf Khan in Veer Kunal (1932). After almost a decade of doing mainly action-oriented roles, she came into prominence with the Kidar Sharma directed Chitralekha (1941) due to her bathing scene in the film. She married her early co-star Ashraf Khan with whom she had a son. They divorced later and she married Sohrab Modi in 1946. Modi cast her in the historical drama Jhansi Ki Rani (1953), which in spite of having spectacular scenes and lavish sets was a disaster. She stopped acting in films following 1953 except to act in her last role as a character artist in Modi's Samay Bada Balwan (1969). She died in Mumbai on 10 April 1997."

  "text" : "Marigo Posio (1882–1932) was one of the most distinguished Albanian women, an activist of the Albanian National Awakening and Independence Movement, and consolidation of the Albanian women social status. She is mostly remembered for sewing (or embroidering) the flag raised by Ismail Qemali during the Albanian Declaration of Independence in Vlorë on 28 November 1912. Marigo was the daughter of Papa Kosta Poçi and Lenka Ballauri (from Voskopojë). Some official Albanian sources define Hoçisht village near Korçë (back then Vilayet of Monastir in Ottoman Empire) to be her birthplace. Some other and later sources mention Korçë itself. Her sister Urani was married to Albanian politician and playwright Kristo Floqi, while the other sister Angjeliqi was married to Albanian politician and Prime Minister Kostaq Kota. Her two brothers Niko and Kristo were both emigrants to US, the first one settled in Natick, MA, and the other in Salt Lake City. She was a relative of Albanian patriot Spiro Ilo, activist of the Albanian colony of Romania and signatory of the Declaration of Independence Act. Marigo was educated in the First Albanian School of Korçë, being the 27th student enrolled in it. She married Jovan Posio from Hoçisht at a young age. The couple used the last name Posio, although it shows up also as Pozio, Pozjo, or Bozjo. The couple moved to Vlora around 1904, in Muradie neighborhood. Their house served as a center for meetings and activities of Albanian patriotic figures of that time. Marigo was a member of the Labëria Patriotic Club founded in Vlore in 1908. She was one of the initiators of the Albanian School of Vlore of 1909. The Albanian Declaration of Independence took place on 28 November 1912 in Vlora. Marigo is considered the \"mother\" of the Albanian flag which was raised during the Independence Act. The official sources mention her to have embroidered the flag. Lef Nosi, respected Albanian politician present at the event, states that the black eagle was cut from satin and was sewed upon the red base. Ekrem Vlora mentions that the flag was a gift from Aladro Castriota and Marigo was given it to make copies. In all cases, she is involved. She also produced many copies of the flag on her own expenses for various offices of the Vlora Government. Marigo is considered a leader of the first Albanian Women Organization, which aimed at helping wounded soldier which came from the border war with Greece. The organization was founded on 13 May 1914. Other members were wives of prominent Albanian figures of the time, i.e. wives of Syrja Vlora or Mehmet Pasha of Delvina. On 6 February 1921, she started publishing her own paper Shpresa shqiptare (\"The Albanian hope\") which continued with 6 issues. The family suffered from a series of misfortunes, first with their children, and later with Marigo's health due to tuberculosis. Kristo Floqi raised his voice on 9 December 1928 accusing the Albanian authorities of having forgotten Marigo's contribute. Marigo did not receive the \"veteran's status\" like many others did post 1912. She died neglected and forgotten in 1932, and was buried in the Zvërnec Monastery cemetery."

Murphy graduated from DePaul University with a bachelor's degree, from Michigan State University with a master's degree in counseling, and from Chicago Theological Seminary with both a master's degree in divinity and a doctorate of ministry. Ordained by the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1984, Murphy held dual standing with that church and the United Church of Christ. He founded St. Stephen's in 1987 and served there until being called to the People's Congregational United Church of Christ in early 2009 where he was senior minister. Murphy's political involvement began in 1997 when he was elected to the Lansing City Council. He served as president in 1999 and 2000. He chaired the public safety committee, served on the Michigan Municipal League's Legislative and Urban Affairs Committee, and the Mayor's Blue Ribbon Committee on Downtown Revitalization. An active participant in politics even before his election to the House, Murphy was one of 100 ministers to visit the White House in advance of the 2000 election to discuss getting out the vote. Murphy was elected to the House in 2000, succeeding Lynne Martinez, to represent the majority of the City of Lansing. He served until 2006 when term limits precluded him from seeking re-election. Murphy died on December 28, 2014 in Washington, D.C., aged 62."

  "text" : "Monroe Edwards (1808 – January 27, 1847) was an American slave trader, forger and convicted criminal who was the subject of a well-publicized trial and conviction in 1842. Originally from Kentucky, Edwards moved to New Orleans then settled in Texas. He smuggled slaves into Brazil in 1832, and used the proceeds to purchase land in Texas. In 1836 he was again smuggling slaves, this time into Texas. After attempting to swindle his partner out of the profits of the venture, partly with forged documents, Edwards was forced to flee the Republic of Texas to the United States. He then tried to scam money out of various abolitionists in the United States and the United Kingdom, partly with forged letters of introduction. He traveled to the United Kingdom, but his schemes were mainly unsuccessful and he returned to the United States in mid-1841. Edwards' largest swindle involved forged letters from cotton brokers in New Orleans, which he used to secure bank drafts for large sums that he then cashed. His fabrications caught up with him and he was arrested and tried for the forgeries in June 1842. Convicted partly because his distinctive good looks made him memorable and easily recognizable, and partly from making the same spelling errors in his fakes, Edwards was sentenced to 10 years in prison and died in 1847 while incarcerated. Several sensational accounts of his offenses and trial were published after his death, and he was mentioned in Herman Melville's 1853 short story \"Bartleby, the Scrivener\"."

In 1969 Demirdžić starred in Karađoz (Black-eyed), a sketch comedy television show that he co-wrote with Jurislav Korenić (1915–1974). It aired on Televizija Sarajevo until 1971. The twin skyscrapers of the Sarajevo United Investment and Trading Company, built in 1986, were unofficially named after the duo."

In the fall of 2012, he received a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation to introduce online Creole language materials in the teaching of STEM in Haiti. He believes that Haitian children should be taught in their native language at all levels of instruction, contrary to the tradition of teaching them in French.  Degraff believes that instruction in French, a foreign language for most Haitian children, hinders their creativity and their ability to excel."

  "text" : "Morris Burke Belknap (June 7, 1856 – April 13, 1910), also known as Colonel Morris Burke Belknap, was a businessman from Louisville, Kentucky, who was the Republican nominee for Governor of Kentucky in 1903. After earning a degree from the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University, he worked at his father's hardware company. Later, he co-founded an agricultural implement company. In 1883, he married Lily Buckner, with whom he fathered four children. Following the death of his father, Belknap became vice-president of his hardware company, a position which he held for the rest of his life. Lily Buckner Belknap died in 1893, and he married Marion S. Dumont in 1900. In addition to his business career. Belknap served in the Kentucky State Guard, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1898, during the Spanish–American War, he served briefly in Puerto Rico prior to the end of hostilities. He was promoted to colonel before his honorable discharge in 1899. In 1903, Belknap accepted the nomination for state governor after being chosen at the Kentucky Republican convention in that year. He campaigned on his business experience and opposition to policies of the current governor, but he was ultimately defeated by the incumbent J. C. W. Beckham. After his unsuccessful gubernatorial run, he spent his later life involved in a variety of civil and religious organizations. On April 13, 1910, he died of pernicious anemia, a condition which is believed to have been worsened by a mysterious ailment he contracted while in Puerto Rico."

  "text" : "Martin Pistorius is a South African freelance web designer, developer, and author best known for his 2011 book Ghost Boy, in which he describes living with locked-in syndrome and being unable to move for 12 to 14 years. When he was 12, he began losing voluntary motor control and eventually fell into a coma for three years. He began regaining consciousness around age 16 and achieved full consciousness by age 19, although he was still completely paralyzed with the exception of his eyes. He was unable to communicate with other people until his caregiver Virna van der Walt noticed that he could use his eyes to respond to things she said. She sent him to the University of Pretoria for testing, where they confirmed he was conscious and aware of his surroundings. His parents then gave him a speech computer, and he began slowly regaining some upper body functions. In 2008 he met his wife Joanna through his sister Kim and in 2009 the pair was married. He co-wrote his autobiography Ghost Boy with Megan Lloyd Davies, which was published in 2011. As of 2011, Pistorius has regained limited control over his head and arms but still needs his speech computer to communicate with others. He has no relation to Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius."

  "text" : "Mamuka (Georgian: მამუკა მუხრანბატონი; Mamuka Mukhranbatoni; died 1751) was a Georgian prince and the head of the Mukhrani branch of the royal Bagrationi dynasty of Kartli. He was Prince (batoni) of Mukhrani and ex officio commander of the Banner of Shida Kartli from c. 1730 and 1735. Having taken part in a rebellion against Nader Shah's Persia, Mamuka had to take refuge in the Russian Empire, where he pursued a military career. He was known as Mehmed Bek to the Persians and as Mamuka Davydov (Russian: Мамука Давыдов) to the Russians. Mamuka was a son of Erekle II, Prince of Mukhrani. He assumed the headship of the house of Mukhrani in 1730 or 1734, when the Kingdom of Kartli was in a state of turmoil and occupied by the Ottoman army. As the Persians began to gain an upper hand in eastern Caucasia, the Georgian nobility became divided on how to deal with the reemerging regional power. Mamuka joined the dignitaries such as Givi Amilakhvari, Shanshe, Duke of the Ksani, and Vakhushti Abashidze in opposition to the Persian hegemony, but he was taken prisoner and sent to fight in the Persian ranks against the Afghans in 1735. He managed to escape and fled to the Russian Empire, where he adopted the surname Davydov, a reference to his family's claim of Davidic descent. In 1738, Mamuka and his fellow Georgian exiles opted for joining the Russian service and formed a Georgian Hussar Company, which was later reorganized into a regiment. Mamuka was appointed the unit's first commander with the rank of a captain and rewarded with an estate in what is now Ukraine. He took part in the concluding phase of the 1735–39 war with the Ottoman Empire and retired in 1741. Mamuka was married to a daughter of King George VII of Imereti; no children of his are known."

  "text" : "Martha Hatfield (also known as The Wise Virgin) (fl. 1652) was an English Puritan prophet. Hatfield was born in Leighton, North Yorkshire, England in the 17th century. Her parents were Faith Westley and Anthony Hatfield. In April 1652, Hatfield became ill with a type of catalepsy. She became paralyzed, blind, deaf and mute. This lasted for seventeen days. When she recovered she began \"rambling\" about religious subjects and started quoting scriptures. What she said was documented by John and Peter, the songs of Edward Rodes, and another man named John Cromwell. On 8 September 1652 she became mute again. She remained mute until 7 December 1652. However, her second recovery did not have any prophetic moments. In 1653, her uncle, James Fisher, who founded the first Presbyterian church in Sheffield, England, wrote a book about Hatfield and her prophetic dialogue called The Wise Virgin. The book was a best seller and was reprinted multiple times."

  "text" : "Madge Jenison (1874–1960) was an American author, activist, and bookstore owner. She wrote novels, short stories, cultural criticism, and scripts. Her father, Edward Spencer Jenison, was a prominent Chicago architect who helped rebuild the city after The Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Her sister, Nancy Blanche Jenison, was a pioneering woman physician. In the early years of the 20th century Madge Jenison moved from Chicago to New York, where she found success with writing, primarily for magazines. She soon met sculptor John Frederick Mowbray-Clarke, at a dinner given by \"some liberal group\". He was immediately taken with her, later telling his wife, Mary Horgan Mowbray-Clarke, that he had been seated between \"two of the most interesting women in America.\" One was the biographer Katharine Anthony; the other was Madge Jenison. In late 1915, she conceived the idea that \"a bookshop of a different kind must be opened in America.\" Jenison co-founded the Sunwise Turn bookshop with Mary Horgan Mowbray-Clarke in a leased building at 2 E. 31st. Besides offering books which interested them personally they also held readings and sold paintings, prints, sculptures and textiles in the small shop. The Sunwise Turn was one of the first bookstores in the America to be run by women, and Jenison wrote in 1923 that \"In the winter of 1919 - 20 we had eight unpaid apprentices - all women of a great deal of background. They sold thousands of dollars worth of books for us. They filed invoices. They swept floors. They ran on errands.\" One of their unpaid interns was Peggy Guggenheim. Working as an apprentice at the Sunwise Turn, she absorbed much about avant-garde culture, and it was there that she was introduced to the poet Margaret Anderson. Harold Loeb wrote of her at this time \"Coming under Mary Clarke's spell Peggy gradually discarded many traditional taboos and adopted a whole set of new ones. Feeling guilty, no doubt, for having inherited wealth, she came to deny herself some of the luxuries to which she was accustomed In compensation she collected the latest in experimental painting and gave money and meals to poor artists and writers.\" Arthur Davies, a principal organizer of the 1913 Armory Show along with John Frederick Mowbray-Clarke, was the designer of the interior of the shop. He chose a \"burning orange\" color for the walls and worked a prism of colors into the woodwork. Artists and writers featured at the bookshop included Theodore Dreiser, who gave the first reading on April 30. 1916. Robert Frost also gave a reading, as well as a host of others, both well-known and unknown. They showed work by artists such as William Zorach, Martha Ryther, Charles Burchfield, and Herbert E. Crowley. Jenison wrote that \"At the end of four years we had branches in Detroit, in the Neighborhood Playhouse, and the Theatre Guild. We had sold books at garden lectures at the Colony Club, at the Socialist and Civil Liberties Conventions, at the International Conference of Women Physicians.\" The Sunwise Turn also published a \"broadsheet\" which included poetry and art, as well as political and social commentary by various authors and artists. They also published full-length books in small editions, including a 500-copy edition of a study of sculptor Auguste Rodin by Rainer Maria Rilke in 1919. Periodicals to which Jenison contributed short stories and social commentary included Harper's Monthly, and The Atlantic in the early 1900s, as well as in later years. She published several books in her lifetime: Dominance (1928), Invitation to the Dance (1929), Roads (1949), and her account of the early years of the Sunwise Turn, Sunwise Turn: A Human Comedy of Bookselling (1923). Jenison earned recognition in the Woman’s Who’s Who of America, and was captain 25 Assembly District (N.Y. City) Woman Suffrage Party. She marched in an autumn 1917 women's suffrage parade, representing women booksellers, who at the time were occasionally allowed to join the Bookseller's League events, but were prohibited from joining. She organized 16 women to participate in the march, but was dismayed at the lack of organization among them. This led to a November 13, 1917, meeting which marked the beginning of the Women's National Book Association (WNBA.) She was never married."

  "text" : "Merle Feld (born in 1947) is an educator, activist, author, playwright, and poet. Merle Feld was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. In 1968 she graduated from Brooklyn College and moved to Boston, where she became involved with the newly founded Havurat Shalom, the community \"often considered a flagship of the havurah movement.\" She began writing her first play, The Opening, in 1981, and in 1983 began work on her second, The Gates Are Closing. This play is often read in synagogues in preparation for the High Holidays. In 1984 she joined B'not Esh, a Jewish feminist community, and early on, during one of their annual retreats, shared her first poems. In 1989 she went to Israel for a sabbatical, where she facilitated an all-female Israeli-Palestinian dialogue group on the West Bank, and demonstrated with Women in Black. This part of her life was the basis of her third play, Across the Jordan, which was included as part of the first anthology of female Jewish playwrights, Making a Scene (Syracuse University Press, 1997). In 1999 she published a memoir, A Spiritual Life: A Jewish Feminist Journey, which has been translated into Russian and published in the former Soviet Union. A revised edition was published in 2007 as A Spiritual Life: Exploring the Heart and the Jewish Tradition. In 2000 she was named a \"Woman Who Dared\" by the Jewish Women's Archive for her peace activism. In 2005 she became the founding director of the Albin Rabbinic Writing Institute, mentoring rabbinical students and recently ordained rabbis across the denominations. In 2011 she published a collection of poems, Finding Words. She is married to Rabbi Edward Feld, and the two have a daughter, Lisa, and a son, Uri."

As a specialist in speech science and signal processing, Sondhi recognized that the future of satellite communications would require developing a technology to cancel the 600 millisecond signal echo created by the delay of transmission. Sondhi and his collaborators at Bell Labs eventually created the echo canceller that made practical satellite transmissions possible.He received 5 patents. In 1998 he received the IEEE Eric E.

He was promoted in the company, but moved back to Denver after the Galveston flood of 1900. In Denver he entered the stock and bond business, and in 1920 founded the Bankers Building and Loan Association, and served as its first president and treasurer. He was active in many civic and religious organizations. He was director of the Denver Chamber of Commerce, which recognized him as Denver’s “most valuable citizen” in 1925. He was a member of Temple Emanuel, president of the Central Jewish Aid Society, and president of the Denver Lodge of the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith. He was a member of the Masons, the Denver Press Club, the Philosophical Society, and the Colorado Bankers Association. He wrote a weekly syndicated column titled “Things to Think About,” which appeared in the Jewish News in the Rocky Mountain Region, and a number of East Coast newspapers. He was also active in a literary group, discussions of which prompted the inquirys he sent to prominent scientists and men of letters. Schayer was married twice, first to Elsie Reinach, who died in 1919, and then to Jane S. Bear. He had two children, Helen Elsie and Charles Milton. He died in 1935."

  "text" : "Myron Stout (1908–1987) was an American abstract painter whose geometric paintings and drawings bridged the styles of Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism. He was born in Denton, Texas. During his senior year at North Texas State University he decided to become a painter, but his progress was halting. He worked as a teacher, and spent part of his time painting landscapes, none of which are known to survive. After military service in World War II, he resumed painting with renewed commitment. In 1946 he began studies with Hans Hofmann. Stout's works of the period 1947–1952 show the influence of European geometric painting, and typically feature multiple intersecting vertical and horizontal bands of color. After about 1950, single forms rather than patterns dominated some of his paintings. In 1952 Stout relocated to Provincetown. In the autumn of that year his readings of Greek mythology, especially the tragedies of Sophocles and Aeschylus, inspired a new direction in his art. Working in black and white, usually on a small scale, he painted flat monolithic shapes which often resembled forks, shields, or lyres. Stout worked slowly and crafted his images with great care. He had an independent income and was not concerned with selling his work. His mature work has been described by Hilton Kramer as \"a mode of abstraction small in scale, purist in form and intimate in feeling—an art utterly devoid of expressionist bravura and emotional display.\" Although he rarely exhibited, in 1954 he displayed charcoal drawings and paintings at the Stable Gallery in New York, and in 1957 he showed at the Hansa Gallery in New York. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1969. Stout had a retrospective at the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston in 1977, and a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1980. Myron Stout died of lung cancer in Chatham, Massachusetts in 1987. The Museum of Modern Art and the Carnegie Museum of Art are among the public collections holding works by Myron Stout. Selections from the Journals of Myron Stout was published in 2005 by Midmarch Arts Press."

MacKenzie led her class in surgery and graduated from Dalhousie University in 1904 as one of the university's earliest female doctors. After working in Boston to raise tuition money to enable her sister Molly to also complete a medical degree from Dalhousie, MacKenzie left America in September 1904 and traveled to India to work as a medical missionary. In 1909, MacKenzie established the Broadwell Christian Hospital in Fatehpur, where MacKenzie and her sister Mary worked for many years. MacKenzie's tireless efforts helped control the cholera epidemic during the 1917 Kumbh Mela pilgrimage. MacKenzie dedicated over three decades to provide medical services to the poor and sick in India. In 1919, MacKenzie was awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal for Public Service in India and in 1940, Dalhousie University awarded her an honorary LLD degree."
