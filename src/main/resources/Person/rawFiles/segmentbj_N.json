According to the Los Angeles Times, Mariachi los Camperos is \"widely considered one of the top mariachi ensembles in the country.\" in 1990, Cano was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). Natividad Cano was born in the village of Ahuisculco, Jalisco, Mexico, on June 23, 1933. His family members worked as day laborers, but they also played mariachi during their spare time. Cano's grandfather, Catarino Cano, taught him to play the Mexican vihuela, a string instrument played in mariachi. He studied at the Academia de Musica in Guadalajara for six years. Cano visited the northern city of Mexicali in 1950, where he joined a mariachi band as an arranger. His mariachi moved to Los Angeles in the U.S. state of [California]. The then leader of the band was killed in a traffic accident. Cano took over the band as its leader and renamed it Mariachi los Camperos, meaning Countrymen. The band has played across the United States, including such landmarks as Carnegie Hall, Disney Hall, Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center, and the Orange County Performing Arts Center. Under Cano, Mariachi los Camperos performed with singer Linda Ronstadt on her 1987 album, Canciones de Mi Padre, and its sequel, Mas Canciones, released in 1992. Mariachi los Camperos won a Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican Album for their 2008 album, Amor, Dolor y Lagrima. In 1969, Cano opened a restaurant, La Fonda, located on Wilshire Boulevard. He had vowed to one day own his own restaurant after being refused service at an eatery in Texas. La Fonda closed in 2007, but reopened with Los Camperos in March 2016. Cano taught and lectured on ethnomusicology at University of California, Los Angeles. He stepped down as leader of Mariachi los Camperos in the 2000s due to declining health, but continued to perform with the group. Nati Cano died at his home in Fillmore, California, on October 3, 2014, at the age of 81. He was survived by his wife, Andrea, and two daughters, Alejandra and Natalie."

He was appointed as the Maha Mudaliyar (Head Mudaliyar) of Dutch Ceylon, hence he was one of the most powerful personalities in the country. He received Mudaliyar medal from Governor Jan Schreuder in 1768 and later received the Head Mudaliyar Gold medal on 31 May 1785 from Governor Van de Graaf, as a recognition and reward for his fidelity towards the Dutch East India company. A Mala Padakkama is also said to have been conferred on him by the Kandyan King of the era."

Herbert reached the rank of SS-Hauptsturmführer in 1938. After the beginning of World War II, he was first employed as a member of the Waffen-SS in Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in 1940. From September 1943 to July 1944, he was commandant of the Warsaw concentration camp. Herbet was arrested together with the Schutzhaftlagerführer and the Lagerältester of Warsaw concentration camp in the wake of a corruption scandal in this concentration camp in the spring of 1944. They were accused by the prisoners of extortion of valuables. All three defendants were detained in Sachsenhausen concentration camp. But, Herbet was soon able to return to the concentration camp service."

As the last king of the 6th Dynasty, Netjerkare Siptah is considered by some Egyptologists to be the last king of the Old Kingdom period. Netjerkare Siptah enjoyed a short reign in the early 22nd century BC, at a time when the power of the pharaoh was crumbling and that of the local nomarchs was on the rise. Although he was male, Netjerkare Siptah is most likely the same person as the female ruler Nitocris mentioned by Herodotus and Manetho."

  "text" : "Nathaniel Dickinson (3 May 1601 – 16 June 1676) was an early English immigrant to America. Dickinson was born in Billingborough, Lincolnshire. He married widow Anna Gull in the mid-1620s and they had at least twelve children, the first five of whom were born in England. Although he was previously thought to have emigrated to America with the Winthrop Fleet, more recent research shows that he and his family likely emigrated between 1636, at which point they still appear in the parish register at Billingborough, and 1638, when they appear in the records in Wethersfield, Connecticut. The family can be traced as early as 1564 in the Billingborough parish register, with the earliest known ancestor a Waters Dickinson, probably born about 1530. Dickinson held several public offices. In Wethersfield, Connecticut, he served as de facto town clerk before being officially appointed in 1645. He served until 1659. He was a deputy to the Connecticut General Court from 1646 to 1659. Other positions he held included jury member of the Particular Court in 1642, selectman of Wethersfield in 1646, and deacon of the Wethersfield church. In the late 1650s, he and a group of fellow dissenters from the Wethersfield church organized a new settlement in Hadley, Massachusetts. In 1660, Dickinson was once again appointed town clerk, this time of Hadley. Three of Nathaniel's sons, John, Joseph, and Azariah, were killed in King Philip's War in 1675 and 1676. Nathaniel died shortly after them on June 16, 1676 and was buried in Old Hadley Cemetery, where there is a memorial and plaque. He was the first Dickinson in America. Nathaniel's ancestry was featured on season two, episode three of the American version of Genealogy Roadshow."

He still holds the current M55 American record for the 10,000 metres. In 1996 he was elected into the inaugural class of the USATF Masters Hall of Fame, the first long distance runner. For more than a decade, Green was the director of the Hall of Fame. Green began running at Piedmont High School, running a 4:31.6 mile. He was the North Coast Section champion in the mile in 1950 which qualified him for the CIF California State Meet, but he didn't place in the final. He ran for two years at the nearby University of California, Berkeley, improving to 4:24, but he stopped running to concentrate on his studies. He wouldn't run competitively again for almost 30 years. After Baptist Divinity School he found his way to work for American Baptist National Ministries in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. On the road racing circuit, starting in 1981 he found himself far ahead of any other 50-year-olds. He still holds masters records in the M60 8 km, M50, M55 and M60 in the 15 km run, M50 and M60 10 mile run, M50, M55 and M60 20 km and half marathon, M50 25 km and M50 Marathon running sub-2:30 with a 2:29:11 at age 51. Those are just the official records, other marks not so recognized include a 2:25:52 marathon at age 52 and a 2:27:42 marathon at age 55, making him the oldest American to run under 2:30. A bout with prostate cancer in 1995 and injuries kept him out of running for almost 11 years but he returned to the competitive scene at age 74. After retiring as a demographer for the Baptist National Ministries, he worked for his local Association of USATF and led the Hall of Fame Committee. Spending a reported 70 hours a week, he would prepare detailed dossiers of each candidate for the vote by the other members of the Hall of Fame, plus the nationwide administrators who elect members. His dramatic, sermon like speeches announcing each inductee's qualifications were legendary until his sudden retirement in 2011. In addition to the Masters Hall of Fame, he is also a member of the Piedmont High School Hall of Fame."

He played for the team again the following season, but they were eliminated from the play-offs by the Brandon Wheat Kings.

He was a pioneer in research into trachoma, congenital cataracts, modern extracapsular cataract extraction, corneal transplantation and strabismus.

Shortly before his death he was nominated Guest Professor of Ophthalmology, and given a research laboratory, at the Goethe University Frankfurt in West Germany."

At that time, women were not allowed to pursue education beyond the elementary level and so she was mainly educated at home. She studied several languages: German, French, Polish and Russian and read literature from various counties. In 1871, she married Theofil Kobrynsky. He died a few years later and she was forced to return to Bolekhiv to live with her parents. Kobrynska went to Vienna with her father, where she met Ivan Franko; Franko encouraged her to take on the task of improving the status of Ukrainian women and to encourage them to seek equality with men. In 1884, she organized the Tovarystvo Rus'kykh Zhinok (Association of Ukrainian Women) to educate women by exposing them to literature and by promoting discussions on women's rights. In 1890, she was part of a delegation that lobbied the Minister of Education to allow women to attend university. She also advocated universal suffrage, day care and communal kitchens. She wrote her first short story \"Shuminska\" (later known as The Spirit of the Times, in 1883; the following year, she wrote a novella For a Piece of Bread. In 1887, with Olena Pchilka, she edited Pershy vinok (The First Garland), a collection of writing by Ukrainian women. Kobrynska's publishing house Zhinocha Sprava (Women’s Cause) produced three issues of a women's almanac called Nasha dolya (Our Fate). She died in Bolekhiv in 1920. Her work was translated to English for the collections The Spirit of the Times (1998) and Warm the Children, O Sun (1998)."

  "text" : "Nick Jordan is a visual artist and experimental filmmaker based in Manchester, UK. Jordan's work has been exhibited widely, including at Innsbruck International Biennale (Austria); ICA (London); Kunstmuseum (Bonn); Academia de Cine (Madrid); Garage Center for Contemporary Culture (Moscow); Musée du quai Branly (Paris). Nick Jordan also works in a collaborative practice with fellow artist Jacob Cartwright, see Jacob Cartwright and Nick Jordan. The artist's practice is cross-disciplinary, encompassing film, drawing, painting, photography, objects, publications and collaboration, and often explores the relationship between the natural world and cultural history.

His main theoretical works center in economic sociology where he has created a \"political-cultural\" approach to markets in works on corporate control, the \"architecture of markets,\" and \"markets as politics.\" He has used these ideas to study the European Union's attempt to create a single market through cooperative political means. In 2008, he published a book with Doug McAdam entitled \"A Theory of Fields\" that proposes a cohesive view of field theory as an approach to study many of the key features of modern life including politics, the economy, and social movements."
