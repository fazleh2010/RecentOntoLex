His tenure of office corresponded with the first administration of Governor Jimmie Davis and the second and third terms of Earl Kemp Long, with whom King was politically allied. In 1960, King was unseated by his fellow Democrat, J. C. Gilbert, a farmer from Sicily Island in Catahoula Parish, who years later switched his affiliation to Republican. King and his brother, John William King, Jr. (1908-1969), were sons of John King, Sr. (1877-1955), and the former Ada Gregory (1881-1972). Dr. King's son, Ralph E. King, Jr. (1931-2006), was married to the former Mary Christine Sullivan (1932-1993); the couple had two daughters, Debra Ruth King (1953-1981) and Terri King Reboul (1956-2013). The Kings are interred at Myrtle Memorial Cemetery in Winnsboro. In 2008, nearly thirty-four years after his death, Dr. King was posthumously recognized as an honorary pall-bearer at the funeral of his first Senate successor, Billy Boles of Monroe."

  "text" : "Robert Emmett Keane (March 4, 1883 – July 2, 1981) was an American actor of both the stage and screen. He was also known professionally by the names: Emmett Keane, Robert Keane, R. Emmett Keane, and Robert E. Keane. He began on stage in the 1910s, with his first Broadway appearance being in the 1914 production of The Passing Show of 1914. He would continue on the stage through the mid-1930s, appearing in both London and New York theater productions. His film career began in 1930, and over the twenty-five years of that career he would appear in between 170-200 films. At the very tail end of his acting life he would make several appearances on the small screen. Married twice, the first time would be a short-lived union with Muriel Inetta Window, an opera singer, vaudeville actress and 1913 Peacock Girl with the Ziegfeld Follies. They were married in approximately 1916 and divorced in 1920. After his divorce, he would marry the actress Claire Whitney in 1921, and they would remain married until her death in 1969. He retired in 1958, and would die on July 2, 1981 and be buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles, next to his wife, Claire (although her grave is unmarked)."

  "text" : "Ravi Sankaran (October 4, 1963 – January 17, 2009) was an Indian ornithologist whose work concerned the conservation of several threatened birds of India. He was the Director of the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Ravi studied at the Rishi Valley School, Madanapalli, Andhra Pradesh; obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology from Loyola College, Chennai and a doctorate from Bombay Natural History Society Ravi joined the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) in 1985 in the endangered species project on the great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) and florican (Otididae) species and played a role in developing recovery plans for these species. He also established Florican Watch, involving local people. Ravi Sankaran studied several endangered birds of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. His work on the Narcondam hornbill, Nicobar megapode and the edible-nest swiftlets aided the development of conservation management of these species. Ravi was also involved in a project Strengthening community conservation efforts in Nagaland: a programme to impart technical support on biodiversity conservation and livelihood options to communities, a collaborative programme between the Nagaland Empowerment of People through Economic Development, Kohima (NEPED), and SACON, in collaboration with other organisations such as Kalpavriksh, Pune; Ecosystems India, Guwahati; Aranayak, Assam; ATREE, Bangalore; andNature Conservation Foundation, Mysore.funded by Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Mumbai. It had been stated that “Ravi’s life and work were marked by a deep passion for conservation of birds and natural areas, an unbridled exuberance and enthusiasm for his work, and the fire of a pioneer spirit that made him take on the most challenging, difficult and remote assignments. This took him from the deserts of western India and the swamps and grasslands across northern India to the snow-clad mountains of the Himalaya (Nanda Devi Expedition) and the dense forests of both north-east India and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. His well-honed field skills and adventurous exploits, wading into mangroves and walking the beaches, exploring caves and remote forests, enduring heat and cold in the desert, rain and flood in the rainforest, and battling multiple bouts of malaria, made him a legend among field biologists in India.” Ravi died in Coimbatore on January 17, 2009."

  "text" : "Raymond II (died 1183), called Raimundo de Minerva, was a Catalan churchman and the bishop of Palencia in the kingdom of Castile from 1148. King Sancho III of Castile refers to him a his avunculus (uncle), implying that he was a brother of the Empress Berengaria, a fellow Catalan. On the other hand, his surname \"de Minerva\" probably indicates that he came from a noble family of the Minervois, perhaps the same family as Count Ponce de Minerva. Prior to his elevation to the episcopacy, he was a monk at the Abbey of Cluny under Abbot Peter the Venerable. His appointment in 1148 to the see of Palencia was probably made on the urging of Berengaria. The empress was visiting Palenca in 1149 when she died. Following the death of Alfonso VII in 1157, his empire was split between his sons: Sancho III taking Castile and Ferdinand II taking León. This division caused the region around Palencia, the Tierra de Campos, in western Castile to become a disputed zone. Into this context, Pope Alexander III sent a letter Raymond castigating him for \"seeking the company of knights more than was appropriate for a man in such a high post\". Raymond was loyal to Sancho III and, after the latter's death in 1158, to his young son, King Alfonso VIII. In 1177 he went on a mission to England to retrieve Alfonso VIII's bride, Eleanor. Raymond was the last of a series of Catalan bishops going back over a century to the restoration of the diocese of Palencia in 1035, and he continued to favour Catalans for positions. A single document of 1162 shows several clerics with Catalan names: the deacon Bernard Simon, the archdeacons Raymond Arnaldi and Bernard Pessun, Abbot Berengar of Hermidas, the episcopal chaplain Garnerius and the diocesan chancellor Martin Ermengaudi. Raymond did not call any diocesan synods, nor did he travel widely in his diocese or show a great interest in restoring churches, but he developed the system of council and archdeaconries through which the diocese was administered. He also favoured economic development and the settlement of underpopulated areas. The first university-educated masters (magistri) also arrived in Palencia during his term. The cathedral school developed under Raymond—which educated men like Domingo de Caleruega, Pedro González Telmo and perhaps Gonzalo de Berceo—became the basis of the University of Palencia after Raymond's death."

He was from the same clan as Ran Yong and Ran Qiu, two other prominent disciples of Confucius. When Confucius served as the Minister of Justice of Lu, Ran became the magistrate of Zhongdu. He contracted a vile disease, possibly leprosy, and died young. Confucius lamented his early death with great pain. In Confucian temples, Ran Geng's spirit tablet is placed the fourth among the Twelve Wise Ones, on the west. Ran Geng's offspring held the title of Wujing Boshi (五经博士; 五經博士; Wǔjīng Bóshì)."

Stanjek has also been training throughout most of his sporting career for the North German Sailing Regatta (German: Norddeutscher Regatta Verein) in Hamburg under his personal coach Alan Smith. As of November 2014, Stanjek is ranked eighth in the world for the two-person keelboat by the International Sailing Federation, following his first-place effort at the ISAF World Cup Series and Star World Championships in Malcesine, Italy. Stanjek qualified as a skipper for the German squad in the Star class at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London by placing second and receiving a berth from the ISAF World Championships in Perth, Western Australia. Teaming with his partner Frithjof Kleen in the opening series, the German duo recorded a net score of 70 points throughout the entire race, but came up short for the medal podium with a satisfying sixth position against a fleet of sixteen boats."

  "text" : "Roger W. Shuy (born 1931 in Akron, Ohio) is an American linguist best known for his work in sociolinguistics and forensic linguistics. He received his BA from Wheaton College in 1952, his MA at Kent State University in 1954, and his PhD at Case Western Reserve University in 1962, where he studied regional dialectology with Raven I. McDavid, Jr. Shuy took additional linguistic courses at the University of Michigan and Indiana University. After teaching linguistics at Wheaton College (1958-1964) and Michigan State University (1964-1967), Shuy accepted a position at the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington, D.C. as head of its newly created program for studying urban language. In 1968, Shuy moved to Georgetown University, where he founded and directed the Sociolinguistics Program and was full professor of linguistics until he retired from teaching in 1998 as Distinguished Research Professor of Linguistics, Emeritus During his 30 years at Georgetown, Shuy helped create two new organizations, New Ways of Analyzing Variation and the American Association of Applied Linguistics, where he was its second president and was later given the award of Distinguished Scholarship and Service. While at Georgetown, he also began a new phase of work on criminal and civil cases as a consultant and expert witness. After Shuy retired from teaching, he made his home among the mountains and rivers of Montana, where he continues to consult on law cases. Since his retirement, Shuy has published thirteen books relating linguistics to law. In all, Shuy worked on some 500 law cases over the years, testifying at trial in over fifty criminal and civil cases in 26 states, four times before the U.S. Congress, and twice before the International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague. Among his most famous criminal cases were the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Abscam bribery investigation of New Jersey Senator Harrison A. Williams, the narcotics investigation of automobile manufacturer John Z. DeLorean, and many cases involving prominent politicians and businessmen. He has written extensively about many of these cases in his books and journal articles. In 2009, he was elected Fellow of the Linguistics Society of America."

  "text" : "Ronen Shoval (Hebrew: רונן שובל‎‎) is an Israeli writer and Zionist-activist. He is the founder of the extra-parliamentary movement Im Tirtzu, and presided as its first chairman (2007–2013). Ronen is the author of the book Herzl's Vision 2.0, a manifest for the rejuvenating Zionism (Im Tirtzu, Kochav M'Israel). He is a columnist in the Israeli newspaper Maariv and previously wrote in Haaretz and Makor Rishon. He was a lecturer at Bar-Ilan University, at a pre-army mechina (a preparatory program), and at other colleges in Israel. He was also a research associate at the Institute for Zionist Strategies. He was elected a board member of the World Zionist Organization, the Jewish Agency and Keren Hayesod. Ronen was elected one of the top one-hundred influential Jews in the world by the Algemeiner Journal. In January 2015, Shoval, running as a candidate in Habayit Hayehudi's primary, called for an investigation into editors at Haaretz, accusing them of \"defeatist propaganda\" prohibited under Statute 103 of Israel's penal code. In response to Shoval's accusations on Facebook, multiple death threats against Haaretz editors were posted, which Shoval promised to remove. The Haaretz cartoon that sparked the death threats said \"10 journalists killed in attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris, about 13 journalists killed last summer in attack on Gaza\" and \"JeSuisGaza\" below JeSuisCharlie. Ronen holds a B.A in international relations and an M.A in Jewish Philosophy from the Hebrew University. He earned a PhD in Jewish political thought from the Paris West University Nanterre La Défense (graduating summa cum laude, mentored by Prof. Shmuel Trigano). Ronen is married, and has four children."

  "text" : "Robert Kurrle, also known as Robert B. Kurrle was an American cinematographer during the silent and early talking film eras. Prior to entering the film industry, he was already experimenting with aerial photography. Considered a very prominent cinematographer, even his early work received notice and praise from both critics and other industry professionals. The advent of sound film did not abate his continued rise, and he became the top director of photography at Warner Brothers by 1932. He shot 70 films over the sixteen years of his career, working with such prominent directors as William Wellman, Raoul Walsh, Michael Curtiz, Archie Mayo, and William Dieterle. He was a member of the American Society of Cinematographers by 1921, and he was also one of the inaugural members of the International Photographers branch of I.A.T.S.E. (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees). In October 1932, at the height of his career, he suddenly fell ill after wrapping a film. Hospitalized, his condition quickly worsened and within a week he was dead of an infection to the brain."

Gibbs was taken to hospital and told the cancer had spread to her brain and lungs; she died at a hospice in Pembury, Kent. She is survived by her husband, Ashley Pitman, and their daughter, Gigi, born 2008."

  "text" : "Roger Thomas Howe was born in Sacramento, CA in 1957 and is a Professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. He is a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering. He earned a B.S. degree in physics from Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA. He earned a M.S. degree and a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1981 and 1984, respectively. He was a faculty member at Carnegie-Mellon University in 1984-1985, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1985-1987, and at UC Berkeley between 1987-2005. He has been a professor at Stanford University since then. His research interests focuses on micro electromechanical system (MEMS), and nanoscale devices and fabrication technology. He and his Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Richard S. Muller at Berkeley, developed polysilicon surface micromachining technology. Such a process opened the possibilities of micro mechanical elements such as cantilevers, resonators, and gears. He was elected an IEEE Fellow in 1996, for \"seminal contributions to microfabrication technologies, devices, and micro-electromechanical systems\". He received the 1998 IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award. In 2005, he was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Engineering; \"for contributions to the development of microelectromechanical systems in processes, devices and systems\". Since 2011, he has been the Director of the U.S. National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN)."

  "text" : "Rampal is an Indian religious leader of Kabir panth, often described as a self-styled godman. He is the founder of a Satlok Ashram, a socio-spiritual movement popular in Haryana state. His sect prohibits temple visits, idol worship, untouchability, adultery and \"vulgar singing and dancing\", among other things. According to Rampal, the Hindu trinity along with their parents have misled people into illusion instead of the worship of Sat Purush (the ultimate god). He instead recommends worshipping Kabir as the supreme god. He claims that all the major religious scriptures — including Vedas, Gita, Quran, Bible and Guru Granth — name Kabir as the supreme god. He claims to be a spiritual successor of Kabir, and some of his followers consider him an incarnation of Kabir. In 2006, Rampal criticised Arya Samaj. This resulted in violent clashes between the followers of two sects, in which an Arya Samaj follower was killed. Rampal was charged with murder, and arrested. After spending several months in jail, he was released on bail in 2008. In November 2014, after he failed to appear in the court multiple times, the court ordered his arrest. However, the presence of thousands of followers, allegedly confined by his aides, prevented the police from arresting him for a few days. He was finally arrested on 19 November 2014."

  "text" : "Ron Devion is a Canadian television executive who worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. A native of Winnipeg, Devion began his career at the CBC in 1955 in the accounts department. In 1977 he became program director for CBLT in Toronto. Devion then served as head of television sports. In this role he was in charge of the CBC's Olympic broadcasts, the CFL on CBC, and Hockey Night in Canada. In 1980, Devion had a number of guest commentators provide analysis during the intermissions of Hockey Night in Canada. He would go to a bar near the CBC's Toronto studios to see how the patrons reacted to the guest. He noticed that Don Cherry received the most attention from the patrons and decided to hire him full-time for $50 an appearance. In 1982, Devion was named director of television in British Columbia. During his tenure in B.C., Devion used co-funding (working with independent producers, Telefilm Canada, and others to co-produce programs) as a way to minimize the damage of budget cutbacks. CBC British Columbia produced a number of programs that were picked up by the national network, including Good Rockin' Tonite, The Best Years, and The Canadian Gardener. Another program produced by CBC British Columbia, Switchback, was adapted for local broadcast by other affiliates. In April 1988, Devion was appointed to the newly created position of Director of Co-Funding for the English television network. In this role, he was responsible for finding private sector and government financing for television programs (outside of news and documentary programming) and obtaining programs from local affiliates to broadcast nationally. One of the local programs Devion picked up for national broadcast was On the Road Again. In 1990 he was offered the position of deputy national head of entertainment, but instead chose to retire. In 1994, Devion came out of retirement to lead CBC's host broadcaster unit at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia. Under Devion's leadership the CBC, which expected to lose $11 million on the games, made a $5 million profit. Due to the success of the '94 games, Devion was offered positions with Atlanta Olympic Broadcasting '96, the in-house broadcasting unit of the 1996 Summer Olympics, and Radio Televisyen Malaysia, the host broadcaster of the 1998 Commonwealth Games. However, he chose to remain retired. Devion currently resides in Brentwood Bay, British Columbia. He had written and published two books; From Stardust and From Stardust, Book II: Personal Memoir."

Birks was born in Adelaide, South Australia on 12 March 1856 to English-born parents William Kyffin Thomas, proprietor of the Observer and Register newspapers, and his wife Mary Jane Thomas, née Good. Known to her family as Rose, Birks was heavily involved in the Flinders Street Baptist Church in Adelaide that her father helped establish. In 1879 Birks married her sister's widower, wealthy Baptist merchant Charles Napier Birks and became the stepmother to her six nieces and nephews. The Birks family would later establish the Charles Birks and Company Department Store in Rundle Street, Adelaide."

He investigated such high profile cases as the Priyadarshini Mattoo murder case, the 2000 South Africa cricket match fixing, and the 2002 Gujarat riots. Raghavan was assisted by Ashok Malhotra, a former CBI Deputy Inspector General, and SIT lawyer R. S. Jamuwar, both \"outsiders to Gujarat\" in the Gujarat riots case. In April 2014, the Supreme Court praised the investigations done by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Raghavan and declined to re-constitute another. Raghavan was among three police officers indicted by the Verma Commission for security lapses leading to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, but Raghavan claimed that the suicide bomber had gate-crashed after Rajiv's arrival."

  "text" : "Rose Melville (January 30, 1873 - October 8, 1946) born Rose Smock, was an American stage actress famous for playing one character her whole career, Sis Hopkins. Melville got her start in 1889 at Zanesville, Ohio playing a male role in a play called Queen's Evidence. Other known plays she appeared in were Uncle Tom's Cabin, The Two Orphans and Fanchon the Cricket. Mellville had a sister Ida, together they formed a traveling stock company. In 1894 a play called Zeb was produced in which Melville performed the Sis Hopkins character for the first time. The play was so successful that it was brought to New York that same year. The Sis Hopkins character appeared in three more plays Little Christopher, The Prodigal Father;1896–97 and By the Sad Sea Waves; 1898-99. Melville presented Sis Hopkins in Vaudeville in a sketch called Sis Hopkins' Visit. After this sketch she had it rewritten as a longer play called Sis Hopkins. It was this play that garnered her greatest fame and she eventually performed it over 5,000 times. In 1916 the Kalem Company contracted with Rose Melville to make twenty-one short films all with Melville starring in her Sis Hopkins character. She dispensed with the Sis Hopkins character briefly in the 20s to play in two feature films in 1922 and 1923. In 1918 Goldwyn Pictures produced a feature film version of the Sis Hopkins play starring Mabel Normand. The film is now lost."

  "text" : "Remington Schuyler (1884–1955) was an American painter, illustrator and writer during the early to mid twentieth century. He was born in Buffalo, New York and was named after Frederic Remington, a relative of his mother's and an extremely accomplished artist from the period. After graduating from high school Schuyler went on to study at Washington University. He went on to receive scholarships to the National Academy in Rome and the Académie Julian in Paris after which he spent time studying at the Art Students League in New York with the influential draftsman, George Bridgman. In 1906 Schuyler studied with Howard Pyle in Wilmington, Delaware. Thanks to his association with Howard Pyle, Schuyler landed his first published illustration on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post, which he was soon working regularly for along with Pearson's and Munsey's Magazine In 1916 Schuyler moved to 76 Huguenot Street in New Rochelle, New York, a prestigious artist community with neighbors such as J. C. Leyendecker, and Norman Rockwell. New Rochelle was also the home of his recently deceased namesake, Frederic Remington. After the Great war Schuyler worked steadily doing interior illustrations for Life, St. Nicholas and Century magazines. He was also doing many pulp covers for FRONTIER STORIES, WEST, and SHORT STORIES. During the 1920s he sold interior story illustrations to Life, St. Nicholas, and The Century. He also painted cover illustrations for pulp magazines, such as Frontier Stories, Short Stories, and Wild West Weekly. Schuyler did illustrations for Boys' Life and the Boy Scout Handbook as part of his thirty years service as a volunteer for the Boy Scouts. Other books illustrated by Schuyler included Daniel Boone, Wilderness Scout by Stewart Edward White, Indian Hunting Grounds and Great White Buffalo. He also was active as a mural painter and was editor of the Architectural Record for a period. During the Depression years, he painted many covers for pulp magazines and worked as a muralist for the WPA artist's program in Connecticut. After the end of the pulp era, Schuyler moved back to his birth state, Missouri, and taught art at Missouri Valley College. He died in 1955 at the age of 71."

  "text" : "Richard Eve FRGS (6 December 1831–7 July 1900) was a solicitor and notary in Aldershot in Hampshire in the 19th century and a prominent Freemason who was the Grand Treasurer of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1889, and the Chairman of the Royal Masonic School for Boys. He defended Ahmed ‘Urabi (Arabi Pascha) in Cairo when he was tried by the restored Khedivate on 3 December 1882 following the ‘Urabi Revolt which had led to the Anglo-Egyptian War. Eve was born in Bromsgrove Street in Kidderminster, the youngest son of Ann and John Eve, the foreman in a local carpet factory. After leaving school Eve was articled to a solicitors' office in Leamington Spa in 1846; here he was initiated into Guy’s Lodge No. 556 (now No. 395) in 1854, becoming Master of the lodge in 1861. He joined Brecknock Lodge No. 936 (now No. 651) in Brecon in Wales in 1861 during a short period there. He set up his own small solicitor's office in Aldershot at the time the British Army was rapidly expanding its presence in the area. Here he joined Panmure Lodge No 723. Over the next 15 years his Aldershot legal practice expanded greatly and he became a prominent local citizen, entering politics and serving on various local authorities and becoming Lord of the Manor of Farnborough in Hampshire and a County Councillor for Hampshire. He defended Ahmed ‘Urabi (Arabi Pascha) in Cairo when he was tried by the restored Khedivate on 3 December 1882 following the ‘Urabi Revolt which had led to the Anglo-Egyptian War. Eve stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate for Parliament five times, once contesting the Kidderminster constituency. At the same time he further developed his interest in Freemasonry, joining the Grand Master’s Lodge No. 1 in London in 1884. Eve was appointed as Treasurer of Supreme Grand Chapter in 1887 and Grand Treasurer of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1889. Eve was Chairman of the Royal Masonic School for Boys management board from 1891 until his death in 1900. In 1899 a Lodge was formed which was linked to the Boys’ School; it was named Richard Eve Lodge (No. 2772) in his honour. A history of the Lodge states that it “had its origin in the wish of many admirers of Richard Eve to perpetuate his name as a worthy citizen of London and as a sterling worker in the Masonic cause.” Richard Eve was taken ill in London where he had gone for the laying of a foundation stone for the Boys’ School, and died at 11 Nottingham Place in Marylebone of a seizure a few days later on 7 July 1900. He was buried in Aldershot Cemetery where a large granite memorial of the figure of Charity and a child adorns his grave. He never married, and his estate of £34,199 6s 8d was left to fellow solicitors and the local hospital in Aldershot. The Masonic funeral was reported in The Freemason on July 21, 1900. “Bro Eve had found in life manifold points of sympathetic contact with his fellows and on this day his friends rose up from all parts of England to pay a last tribute of respect to his memory... It was a solemn and inspiring sight – this long procession of black-coated men. The great body of Masons marched in twos in front of the carriage. There were about 100 of them, all wearing the customary white gloves and carrying their sprigs of acacia.” A 29 foot tall monumental drinking fountain to Eve's memory was unveiled in Brinton Park in Kidderminster in 1902. This was raised by “Admiring friends to keep his memory green in his native town which he ardently loved.” The monument is faced with glazed Doulton tiles in green, terracotta and bronze and a portrait of Eve in profile."

  "text" : "Ruth Agnes Daly (born 1958) is an American astrophysicist. She obtained a B.A. in Psychology and English from Boston College in 1979 and then switched fields to study Astronomy and Physics at Boston University. She obtained her Masters and Ph.D. in Astronomy and Physics from Boston University in 1984 and 1987, respectively, working with thesis advisers Alan P. Marscher and Sheldon Lee Glashow. She was a NATO-NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge from 1987 to 1988, sponsored by Sir Martin Rees. She joined the Physics Department at Princeton University in 1988, first as a Research Associate (1988 to 1989), then as an Instructor (1989 to 1990), and finally as an Assistant Professor (1990 to 1998). She joined the faculty at Bucknell University in 1998, and the faculty at the Pennsylvania State University at the Berks Campus in 1999. She is currently a Professor of Physics at Penn State University, Berks campus. Daly conducts theoretical, phenomenological, and observational work in astrophysics. Her main areas of study are cosmology and extragalactic astrophysics. She is most well-known for her work on the expansion and acceleration histories of the universe, the use of these histories to determine the contents of the universe, and studies of the properties of supermassive black holes, e.g., as summarized. Non-specialists interested in this work can read about it in the popular literature, such as Sky & Telescope. Some key results, obtained in collaboration with Professor Stanislav George Djorgovski, are that the expansion and acceleration histories of the universe can be determined in a model-independent manner, which does not require that a theory of gravity be specified and does not depend upon the contents of the universe. The results indicate that the universe is accelerating at the present time, and was decelerating in the recent past. Daly has also shown that the properties of outflows from the vicinity of a supermassive black hole can be used to estimate the spin of the black hole. Her ongoing research into the acceleration of the universe and the properties of supermassive black holes is discussed in detail in her publications, linked at her website."

  "text" : "Ram Singh II (27 September 1835 – 17 September 1880), was the Maharaja of Jaipur from 1835 until 1880. He was a son of Jai Singh III, Raja of Jaipur. About Maharaja Ram Singh II: Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh ascended the throne in 1835. A minor at the time, the administration of the State was conducted by the Minority Council however in lieu of his intelligence, arduous application of State affairs and great grasp of details of State administration he was invested with full powers even before attaining majority.The modernization of Jaipur, under the British influence, was first brought about by Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II. After Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, he is considered as the most enlightened of the Jaipur rulers. Called upon to guide the destiny of this State at a very crucial moment in history, when the country stood at the parting of ways. The great Mughal Empire, after running nearly three centuries, was tottering to its fall, while the British statesmen and politicians were engaged in the herculean task of building a new India on the ruins of the old. The East India Company emerged stronger, more stable and had extended its influence throughout the country. A shrewd observer of these new changes and developments, the Maharaja realized the importance and necessity of keeping abreast with the new tendencies and spirit within which this country had begun to pulsate. He therefore took steps to introduce new measures of reform, improvements and developments. Embellishing Jaipur with amenities of modern life and made it not only one of the most picturesque capitals of India but also a progressive and modern State.1860; after establishing peace and tranquility in the State, Maharaja Ram Singh turned his attention towards the improvement of administration and welfare of his people in which he was equally successful. He used to look into the details of every department of State and kept himself fully well informed on what was going on in the different sections of the State administration. His methods of roaming the streets incognito to check on state-officials and the wellbeing of the subjects were very effective. On works of public utility; he built the Jaipur Water Works (1875), Gas Works (1878), the Mayo Hospital, the Ramniwas Gardens with the Museum, School of Arts, Public Library, Ramprakash Theater, Maharaja’s College (1844), Sanskrit School (1865), the Noble’s School (1862), the Girls School (1867. The Public Works Department was established in 1860. Roads and highways between Jaipur, Ajmer and Agra were constructed during his reign. Besides these dams for irrigation purposes, public buildings, and offices were also built. He was also a reformist and it was in his reign that slavery, child infanticide, and the cruel custom of sati were officially abolished in the State of Jaipur.In the Literary field, Maharaja Ram Singh ji’s major contribution was a lithographic press that added many valuable books to the Pothikhana. Besides being an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva the Maharaja also pursued modern activities such as ballroom dancing, billiards, polo, badminton, kite flying etc. He was the first Photographer Prince of India and the only one to start a formal course in Photography in an institution other than a photography studio. His personal studio or photukhana was filled the latest and best equipments of the time. A member of the Bengal photographic society and hired a Calcutta based English photographer, together, they recorded the building activities in Jaipur, the people, their costumes and culture. Maharaja Ram Singh was the most enlightened and progressive ruler of his time. The British Government recognized his outstanding merits by nominating him twice a Member of the newly formed Viceroy’s Legislative Council, and by adding four guns to his salute. The title of G.C.S.I was also conferred upon him."

  "text" : "Robert Darwin of Elston (12 August 1682 — 20 November 1754) was the father of Erasmus Darwin, an English physician and an ancestor of the famous English naturalist and geologist, best known for his contributions to evolution, Charles Robert Darwin. It is with Robert Darwin of Elston that many biographies of his great-grandson begin. In 1718 Darwin discovered the first remains of a Jurassic reptile to be found; a partly fossilised plesiosaur, about 3 m long. The stone plate came from a quarry at Fulbeck and had been used, with the fossil at its underside, to reinforce the slope of a watering-hole in Elston. After the strange bones it contained had been discovered, it was displayed in the local vicarage as the remains of a sinner drowned in the Great Flood. by William Stukeley described in a paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, calling the fossil \"a rarity, the like whereof has not been observed before in this Island\". Stukely affirmed its \"diluvial\" nature but understood it represented some sea creature, perhaps a crocodile or dolphin. The specimen is today preserved in the Natural History Museum, its inventory number being BMNH R.1330. It is the earliest discovered more or less complete fossil reptile skeleton in a museum collection. It can perhaps be referred to Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus. Darwin married Elizabeth Hill (1702-1797) on 1 January 1724 at Balderton, Nottinghamshire. They had four sons and three daughters: \n*  Robert Waring Darwin of Elston (1724-1816) \n*  William Alvey Darwin (1726-1783) \n*  Anne Darwin (12 November 1727 – 3 August 1813) \n*  Susannah Darwin (10 April 1729 – 29 September 1789) \n*  John Darwin (1730 – 1805), rector of Elston \n*  Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802), the poet, philosopher, physician, etc."

She grew up in a Jewish family, and recognized at an early age that she was a lesbian, yet in her upbringing she was too afraid to tell anybody. Sanlo went on with her life and decided to get married to a man she dated in college and later they had two children. At the age of 31, Ronni came out to friends and family, but one year after that because of laws created in Florida she lost custody of her children. The unfair treatment towards the LBGT community and her rights as a mother are what gave Sanlo the drive to get involved in activism and LGBT politics."

He received a BSc degree from the University of Otago in 1956, and two years later an MSc for his work on mycorrhizae morphology in native New Zealand plants. In 1961, having been awarded a National Research Fellowship the year before, McNabb left New Zealand for the UK to study with Cecil Terence Ingold at Birkbeck College. McNabb earned a PhD in 1963; his thesis was titled \"Taxonomic studies in the Dacrymycetaceae\". He was jointly awarded the Hamilton Memorial Prize in 1966 from The Royal Society of New Zealand, the same year he was appointed to the editorial board of the New Zealand Journal of Botany. Most of McNabb's later publications, largely published in this journal, were about fungal taxonomy. Fungus species named in honor of McNabb include Paxillus mcnabbii (now Austropaxillus mcnabbii), and Entoloma mcnabbianum."

  "text" : "Dr. Ruth V. Hemenway (1894–9 July 1974) was an American Christian medical missionary known for her work in China from 1924 to 1941. Despite the limited opportunities available to women in this time period, Hemenway attended medical school and interned at Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania. Her own experiences and firm belief in Christianity inspired her to improve the health care for women in Fukien, a province of China. In the midst of political unrest, Hemenway established several clinics and medical facilities in rural China, vastly improving the prenatal care in the area. As Hemenway spent more time in China, observing traditional village life in the decisive years before the Communist Revolution, she began to feel more isolated from the Christian faith. She spent the remainder of her time advocating the implementation of modern knowledge in order to improve Chinese society."

  "text" : "Renee Richetts (November 5, 1954) is an American artist best known for her hinged metal books, created from re-purposed materials. Her genre of work is mixed-media sculpture in the category of artist books. Examples of her work are represented in public collections at the University of California in San Diego, the Girl Scout Museum in New York, and at the San Diego Discovery Children’s Museum in Escondido, California. Her work is widely collected in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.In 2005, Richetts' solo show, \"Towers and SPAM\" was presented in The Joan Irving Gallery. The series was an oft-times comedic pun between the precooked meat product Spam, (which is a staple in her kitchen), and the junk mail bane of internet users. In 2010, Richetts' Gallery space in Southern California began showing her art work and curator skills full-time, through installations and exhibits of her work and that of other artists, including painters Lisa Bebi, and Victoria Huckins, photographers Colene Nguyen and Brooke Binkowski, and glass artists Kellene Richetts-Nguyen and Cherrie La Porte.Richetts is also known for her eco-friendly garments and accessories, designed with recycled materials. She is an annual participant in the Escondido Arts Partnership/Municipal Gallery Recycled Materials Runway Event."

Dr. Huffman was also the principal investigator for the Auroral Ionospheric Mapper (AIM) on the HILAT Spacecraft and the Auroral/Ionospheric Remote Sensor (AIRS) on the Polar BEAR Spacecraft. In 1983 the Auroral Ionospheric Mapper produced the first pictures of Aurora Borealis made under full daylight conditions. Although the aurora cannot be seen in the visible spectrum during daylight hours, Dr. Huffman's instrument was able to capture an image in the ultraviolet spectrum. In the early 1970s Dr. Huffman was Program Manager for Project Chaser, a series of launches of Aerobee 170 sounding rockets from Vandenberg AFB Probe Launch Complex C. The purpose of Project Chaser was to measure exhaust plumes from anti-ballistic missile systems launched simultaneously with Project Chaser. His memoir \"Adventures of a Star Warrior: Cold War Rocket Science on the Space Frontier\" was published posthumously."

DeWitt, Jr. of south Rapides Parish was elected to the post. DeWitt was years later the House Speaker. Munson and his wife, the former Kathryn Fluke, later Kathrym Dammon (born 1922), had three children, Pamela M.

  "text" : "Robert O'Hearn (July 19, 1921 – May 26, 2016) was an American set designer. Though known for his productions of theatre and ballet, he was particularly associated with opera. He designed productions for the Metropolitan Opera from 1960 through 1985. Robert O'Hearn was born in Elkhart, Indiana. He attended Indiana University where he received his Bachelor of Arts in 1943. From 1948 through 1952 he worked at the Brattle Theatre at Harvard University, designing numerous productions. (His work is now part of the Harvard University Theatre Collection.) Having made his Broadway theatre debut in 1950 doing the set and costume design for The Releapse by John Vanbrugh, O'Hearn began working regularly on Broadway in 1953 beginning with a production of Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost. O'Hearn made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1960 with a production of Gaetano Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, notable for the unique conceit of having Dr. Dulcamara enter by a descending balloon. O'Hearn designed 13 productions for the Met, usually working in conjunction with stage director Nathaniel Merrill. In addition to working on Broadway and at the Met, O'Hearn designed productions for The New York City Opera, New York Shakespeare Festival, New York City Center Theater, American Ballet Theater, New York City Ballet, Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Boston Opera Company, Chicago Lyric Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Ballet West, Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, and the San Francisco Ballet. He designed a production of Der Rosenkavalier for the Canadian Opera Company. In Europe O'Hearn designed productions for the Vienna Volksoper, Bregenzer Festspiele, Hamburg State Opera, as well as productions in Strasbourg, and Karlsruhe. From 1968 through 1988 O'Hearn was a professor at the New York Studio and Forum of Stage Design. Beginning in 1988 until his retirement in 2008, O'Hearn focused exclusively on teaching at the Jacobs School of Music at his alma mater, Indiana University. He died in Bloomington, Indiana on May 26, 2016."

R & A Garrett opened in mid 1875, in a flat behind Baker Street station, moving to 2 Gower Street in c.1884. Together they wrote and published Suggestions for House Decoration in 1876, part of the 'Art at Home' series of interior decoration and household taste manuals published by Macmillan under the general editorship of W. J. Loftie. It was illustrated with engravings of furniture and rooms, probably of their own home at Gower Street,which was also their business premises. Examples of furniture designed by the Garretts are at Standen House, including a daybed and footstools, with characteristic wedge-shaped legs. Some of these items of furniture are illustrated in Suggestions for House Decoration. R & A Garrett also decorated the home of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Rhoda's cousin, at 4 Upper Berkeley Street in London, to which she and her husband Skelton had moved in June 1874."

He won two further medals at the 1915 Games and also represented his country in baseball at three editions of the tournament. He was a founder of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the Philippines in 1924. A doctor of medicine and surgeon by training, in 1930 he became the first Filipino to gain a physical education degree from the United States. At age 30 he was appointed head of physical education at the University of the Philippines – the country's first and most prestigious university. He later served as national sports director and was a long-standing secretary-treasurer for the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (a forerunner to the national Olympic committee). He coached David Nepomuceno—the country's first Olympian in 1928—and was the Filipino head of delegation for the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Ylanan helped develop sports in the Philippines, with a focus on Western sports such as baseball, basketball and track and field. He developed a national sports programme, assisted in the building of the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex and wrote several works on sport, including a book which was posthumously published."

On the opening of the London University in 1828, later University College, London, he was chosen by Edward Turner, the Professor of Chemistry, as his assistant along with William Gregory. In 1831 he was appointed chemist to the London brewers Truman, Hanbury & Buxton, becoming the first qualified chemist to work for a British brewery. From 1842 (upon Hennell's death) until shortly before his death he was the chemical operator at the Society of Apothecaries. On 3 August 1836 at Christ Church, Spitalfields he married Elizabeth Jackson (1816-1909), daughter of Dr George Jackson MRCP, inventor of improvements to the microscope and they had four children, their eldest son being Robert Warington FRS, the father of Katherine Warington.

As a campaigner, she has spoken publicly about her experiences as a survivor of domestic violence in order to raise public awareness and advocate for changes in police responses, the delivery of support services and government engagement. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said of domestic violence in Australia that it \"requires a great advocate and Rosie has been able to do that in a way that I think nobody has done before.\" Batty is considered to have had a significant influence on national public attitudes, donations and allocations of funding, government initiatives, and police and legal procedures related to domestic violence in Australia."

  "text" : "Rob Shepardson is a political consultant and marketing strategist, who in April 2014 was named by Barack Obama to the President’s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition (PCFSN). He had become known for his work on the Barack Obama presidential campaigns of 2008 and 2012, as a member of the paid media team. Shepardson's marketing communications firm, SS+K was tasked with registering and winning the support of millennials (18- to 34-year-olds). In 2008, 66% of those under 30 voted for Barack Obama. In 2012, 1.25 million more millennials voted for Obama than in 2008, tipping swing states such as Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio in his favor. Shepardson is a co-founder and partner of SS+K, a New York-based advertising agency. In addition to political work, the firm also has non-profit clients that include the LIVESTRONG Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Bono’s ONE Campaign, as well as numerous corporate clients that include HBO, Starbucks, Wells Fargo and The New Yorker."

  "text" : "Ray Alden Kunze (March 7, 1928 – May 21, 2014) was an American mathematician who chaired the mathematics departments at the University of California, Irvine and the University of Georgia. His mathematical research concerned the representation theory of groups and noncommutative harmonic analysis. Kunze was born in Des Moines, Iowa and grew up near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He began his undergraduate studies at Denison University but transferred to the University of Chicago after two years, and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics. After working as a military mathematical analyst, he returned to the University of Chicago, and earned his Ph.D. in 1957 with a dissertation on Fourier transformations supervised by Irving Segal. As well as his positions at UCI and Georgia, he also worked at the Institute for Advanced Study, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brandeis University, and Washington University in St. Louis. He has over 50 academic descendants, many of them through his students Paul Sally at Brandeis and Edward N. Wilson at Washington University. With his advisor Irving Segal, Kunze was the author of the textbook Integrals and Operators (McGraw-Hill, 1968; 2nd ed., Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften 228, Springer, 1978). With Kenneth M. Hoffman he was the author of Linear Algebra (Prentice-Hall, 1961; 2nd ed., Pearson, 1971). In 1994, a special session on representation theory and harmonic analysis was held in honor of Kunze as part of the 889th meeting of the American Mathematical Society, and the papers from the session were published as a festschrift.In 2012, Kunze was recognized as one of the inaugural fellows of the American Mathematical Society."

  "text" : "Rory Mallinson (October 27, 1913 – March 26, 1976) was an American actor of film and television. Born on October 27, 1913 in Atlanta, Georgia, Mallinson would begin his acting career after signing a contract with Warner Brothers in 1945. That year he would have a small role in the film, Pride of the Marines, starring John Garfield and Eleanor Powell. Mallinson would continue making films through the 1940s, and throughout the 1950s, appearing in over 90 films during this period. Notable films in which he would perform include: a featured role in the 1947 film noir Dark Passage, starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall; Mighty Joe Young (1949); the Abbott and Costello vehicle, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951); the 1952 western, Springfield Rifle, starring Gary Cooper; and Howard Hawks' 1952 film, The Big Sky, which stars Kirk Douglas, Dewey Martin, and Elizabeth Threatt. In the early 1950s, he also had a featured role in the film serial, Blackhawk. His final performance in the film industry would be in the western, Westbound (1959), starring Randolph Scott and Virginia Mayo.  During the 1960s, his career diminished, and he would only make a handful of guest appearances on several television series during the decade, including performances on Cheyenne and Mannix. Mallinson died on March 26, 1976 in Los Angeles, California."

  "text" : "Roland Bocquet (3 June 1878-16 October 1956) was a British composer, pianist and teacher who for most of his career was based in the city of Dresden, and is chiefly associated with the composition of German Lieder. For the most part his work was rarely heard in Britain and he is now relatively unknown. In Germany, however, he had a limited but devoted following during his lifetime, and his music is still performed."

  "text" : "Robert Fredrick (\"Ric\") Stowe (born 1944) is a businessman who was once prominent in Western Australia. Stowe acquired Griffin Coal in 1979 and later acquired SkyWest and East-West Airlines during the 1980s. In 1984, Stowe joined the John Curtin Foundation along with Alan Bond, Ernest Henry Lee-Steere and Laurie Connell to raise funds for the then premier of Western Australia, Brian Burke. The reclusive millionaire moved to Monaco in 1986, mooring his 60-metre (200 ft) yacht Capella at the tax haven. Since then he has split his time between his new home and Western Australia. Stowe separated from his partner, Jemma Lee-Steere (Ernest Lee-Steere's daughter), in 1990. The subsequent court battle was subjected to media scrutiny. The couple had three daughters and had been together for ten years. Though they never married, she changed her surname to Stowe by deed poll at his insistence. In 1994 she sued Stowe for A$250 million and, by 2000, a settlement was reached. In 2003, Stowe married Anne-Margaret MacDermott of Perth, his fourth wife. In 2010 administrators were called in when Griffin Coal failed to pay a US$25-million instalment on US$475 million worth of bonds. Griffin had also failed to pay the Australian Taxation Office a A$5-million instalment of a A$65-million debt. The company collapsed shortly afterward, leaving an estimated A$2 billion debt on coal and associated energy assets. Soon after, properties from another Stowe company, WR Carpenter Agriculture Pty Ltd, which controlled a herd of 50,000 cattle, were being sold off; these included Minilya and Joanna Plains Stations. A fire sale of Stowe assets followed, with his estate, Devereaux Farm, near Bullsbrook selling in 2013. The 2,700-hectare (6,672-acre) property—with a 20-room, 8-bathroom mansion, two swimming pools, two helipads and a polo field—for which the asking price was A$70 million, sold for A$21.35 million in 2013."

Owen’s 1945 findings were published in the journal Science. This observation demonstrated that self was “learned” by the immune system during development and paved the way for research involving induction of immune tolerance and early tissue grafting.  When Frank Macfarlane Burnet and Sir Peter Brian Medawar were awarded their 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of acquired immunological tolerance, Owen was not mentioned in the prize. However, in a letter to Owen, Medawar stated that he believed Owen should have also been included in the prize. Owen also led the successful effort to admit women as California Institute of Technology (or Caltech) undergraduates."
