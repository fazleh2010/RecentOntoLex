  "text" : "Stefan Nilsson is a former Landskrona BoIS footballer, who represented the club from 1971 until 1984 (1971-1980 in Sweden's finest assembly, Allsvenskan) and played 436 games for the club. He mostly played in the defence, but on occasions also in the midfield. He became a hero at 15. May 1974. After local rivals Malmö FF's Bo Larsson had equalized an early BoIS lead, in the 77. minute most of the 24.746 in the crowd anticipated also a winning goal for Malmö FF. But instead Stefan Nilsson scored the match winning 2-1 goal in the 85. minute on a long hard shot. This was the first time ever, which his club had won at Malmö Stadion (build for the FIFA World Cup 1958 in Sweden). After Landskrona BoIS' relegation to second tier football in 1980, Nilsson continued for another four seasons. But after the 1984 relegation to the third tier, he ended his career as a footballer. However he wasn't quite finished with this club. In 1985 Stefan Nilsson became Chairman of Landskrona BoIS. Perhaps surprisingly, he let manager Claes Cronqvist finish the last of his three-year contract, despite the relegation. However everything eventually turned out well in the 1985 season. And after an exciting qualifying double meeting against Linköpings FF, decided by a penalty shootout in front of more than 6000 attenders at Landskrona IP, his club was back at a decent level at least. In 1986 Stefan Nilsson brought Danish manager Kurt Stendahl to the club. And two Danish players as well, Bo With and Jan Nielsen. And as newcomers at the second tier, the 1986 season appeared to work out rather well, yet he decided not to continue as chairman. He declared \"I have had lots of joy as active for the club, and during the two latest years I've learned much as well\". New chairman became Krister Clerselius."

Naqvi is significant for his unique style of preaching of Islam-e-Naab, The pure Islam, stepping away from the traditional practice among Shia Muslims ulema of confronting Sunni Muslims beliefs and delivering dialogue-filled sermons derived from unreliable sources. He focuses more on implementing Islam in today's world, rather than living in the past. Naqvi is also the founder of the monthly magazine Masharab-e-Naab. His lectures and speeches  make him unique from other Muslim Urdu scholars. He stresses over Islamic Revolution of Iran and wants to establish Wilayat System."

Chief Dr. Ortom was admitted into Idah Secondary Commercial College, Idah, in Kogi State in 1976. He did two years in the school before his father's retirement in 1979 brought an abrupt end to his dream of completing formal secondary school education on account of inability to pay school fees. Shortly before this happened, he had given his life to Jesus Christ. However, instead of idling away at home to mourn his fate he girded his loins and got into the Gboko motor park as a tout. It was in the park that a Good Samaritan taught him how to drive because of his honesty and dedication to duty. Another helped him to obtain a driver's license, and soon after he became employed as a professional driver. On recommendation he became the driver and confidant of a prominent Gboko-based Christian leader and politician, Pa Samu Ihugh."

  "text" : "Sorana Gurian (born Sara Gurfinchel, October 18, 1913– June 10, 1956) was a writer, journalist, and translator who wrote both in Romanian and in French. Born in the Russian Empire, in Comrat, Bessarabia, she lost both of her parents while still young. After that, she and her two younger sisters, Lia and Isabela, were taken care of by their stepmother. She went to high school in Bender, passing her Baccalauréat exam in 1931, and then studied at the Letters Department of Chernivtsi University and Iași University without graduating. She became a member of Eugen Lovinescu's Sburătorul literary circle in 1937, after returning from Berck, France, where she had gone for balneotherapeutical treatment of her extrapulmonary tuberculosis. While in France, it seems, she also studied at the Sorbonne. When she returned to Romania, she started publishing articles, first in the \"Lumea\" magazine in Iași, which were clearly democratic, antinationalist, antifascist and antirevisionist in style. Feeling the effect of the antisemitic laws, she joined the underground opposition, which the Communists were also a part of. The Gestapo began to take an interest in her in 1942, and she hid for two years in a building basement, surviving with the help of the priest of the French legation and the head of a Catholic girls' boarding school in Bucharest. Under the influence of Vladimir Ghika, she had by then converted from Judaism to Catholicism. After Romania changed sides on August 23, 1944, thanks to the fact that she knew Communists from her time in the underground opposition, she was named director of Universul. In the first three years after the war, she collaborated with many leftist publications, wrote propagandistic texts and, as she knew Russian, worked as an interpreter for the Allied Commission. But after a while, she was suspected by the Communist authorities of being a French spy, and realizing that the new regime imposed one restriction after another beginning a reign of terror, in 1949, she managed to escape from Romania by entering into a marriage of convenience with an Italian citizen helped by the Italian ambassador. After divorcing her husband, she went to Palestine, where she stayed until 1950, and then emigrated to France, settling down in Paris. She died of cancer in Paris in 1956."

The allegations were later dismissed. On 15 February 2016, he was dismissed from his position as Vice-Chancellor of Visva-Bharati University by the President of India.

  "text" : "Surjo Raphael Soekadar (born July 4th, 1977 in Wiesbaden, Germany) is a German physician, neuroscientist and development aid worker. He studied medicine in Mainz, Heidelberg and Baltimore and graduated under Herta Flor, ZI Mannheim, with a doctorate in clinical neuropsychology. Since 2005 he works at the University of Tübingen. Surjo Soekadar has been involved for many years in the field of development cooperation dealing with establishing youth health centers in Africa, South America and Asia. In 2001 he co-founded the Global Contract Foundation, Hamburg, and served as board member of various non-governmental organizations, e.g. \"Options For Life International\" and the Global Contract Foundation. In 2004 he became the youngest creative member of the Club of Budapest after having drafted the first outline of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative. Scientifically, he examines the adaptation of the brain to changing environmental conditions (neural plasticity). He is particularly working on the development and testing of clinical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) and their combination with non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). As part of a research fellowship at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), he and his colleagues were the first to record neuromagnetic brain activity in the millisecond range while the brain of a human subject underwent transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). It is expected that this new method will greatly contribute to a better understanding of electrical brain stimulation’s clinical success and to solving various fundamental research questions in neuroscience. In 2012 he received the International Annual BCI Research Award (together with Niels Birbaumer)."

He taught kenjutsu and acted as a spiritual mentor to Katsu Kaishū. Shimada was a skilled swordsman in his youth, and in 1837 he travelled to Edo to partake in challenge matches. His ferocity and ability with the sword brought him considerable success, and he finally issued a challenge to Otani Nobutomu, who was at the time the most highly regarded swordsman in the city. During the duel, Otani allowed Shimada to win, in order to gauge the young man's response to an easy victory. Toranosuke subsequently requested instruction from Inoue Gensai, but Inoue recommended that he visit Otani again and become his student. Sceptical of studying under a man he had previously defeated, Shimada challenged Otani to a rematch - this time, Otani defeated him utterly. After this, Otani accepted Shimada as his student."

Senitam is first mentioned 605/6 as being appointed as the leader of the Sasanian invasion of Armenia, thus succeeding the previous Sasanian commander of Armenia, Datoyean. Senitam shortly outflanked the troops of the Byzantine commander at Anglon, Theodosius Khorkhoruni. The Byzantines then asked for an allowance to withdraw from the city, but were defeated and routed during a surprise attack by Senitam, who captured Theodosius. Senitam then defeated another army in Basean, while various fortresses fell under Sasanian control. Later in 606/7, Senitam was succeeded by Ashtat Yeztayar."

  "text" : "Stefano Pesori (fl.1648 in Mantua – 1675) was a 17th-century Italian 5-course Baroque guitarist, composer, and teacher. Pesori was a renowned guitarist in his time, and had upwards of 140 students, including high-ranking nobility. He is not well known today. He worked as a composer, teacher, and performer in the 17th century, using both written notation and Alfabeto – the precursor to modern “lead-sheet”systems – that associated letters with certain harmonies. Stefano Pesori published five books in his lifetime. Graham Wade remarks that they, “employ[ed] both strummed and plucked styles, including battute accompaniments to songs and dances” . Many of these books heavily borrow material from one another, as shown by evidence that he used identical engraving plates for multiple sections of many of his works. The books contain lists of his students, often arranged according to their social status. His prototypical student would have been novices – as evidenced by the book's largely simplistic music. These encompass music in lower positions of the instrument that avoided complex textures, rhythms, and techniques. Some of his more famous contemporaries – such as Giovanni Paolo Foscarini (fl. 1600–1647) and Francesco Corbetta (c. 1615 – 1681), paved the way for the Guitar's popular emergence in the coming centuries."

The story, titled \"A Rape on Campus\", was later found to be unsupported by any evidence. The magazine retracted the article following a Columbia University School of Journalism review which concluded that Erdely and Rolling Stone failed to engage in \"basic, even routine journalistic practice\". As a result, Erdely has been named in three lawsuits with demands of more than $32 million combined for damages resulting from the publication of the story. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Erdely has written about rape and bullying. Prior to the Rolling Stone article, her work appeared in GQ, Self, The New Yorker, Mother Jones, Glamour, Men's Health and Philadelphia. Erdely's Rolling Stone story \"A Rape on Campus\" was named by Columbia Journalism Review as \"the Worst Journalism of 2014\" and as \"Error of the Year\" by the Poynter Institute."

Hammer was a trained engineer and helped his father with the expansion of the Gällö sawmill. He moved to Norway in 1899, where he worked as a Swedish Consul and as the French General Agent for the Narvik Iron Ore Line. In 1896, he married Hilma Lindh (b. 20 March 1864) from Mora, Sweden. After the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian union in 1905, Hammer moved to Tromsø, and later to Christiania around 1911. His marriage remained without child and the couple was divorced in 1914. The same year, Hammer married Benedicte Jabobsen, who was born in 1891 in Tysfjord, Norway. They had three sons, Frits Annar Bent (born in 1914), Sigurd Otto Henry (born in 1915), and Benny Thor (born in 1920 in Denmark). In 1928 Sigurd Hammer completed a book about his father O.C Hammer with his brother Regnar. Hammer moved to Stockholm in 1917 and lived there until his death on 4/1 1945."

The most notable member of the family was Sir Jenico d'Artois the elder (died 1426) who was a trusted military commander in three successive reigns. That Sampson was a close relative, possibly a brother, of Jenico is confirmed by Jenico's will, in which he appointed his widow Elizabeth and Sampson as his co-executors. An order of the Privy Council of 1426 released them from any debts incurred as executors. Sampson was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland in 1424; he appointed James Blakeney as his deputy. Blakeney became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1431, when Sampson presumably either died or retired."

A momentous event in her career was on 8 March 2011, on the International Women's Day, when she became Asia's first woman train driver to drive the Deccan Queen from Pune to CST, through difficult but scenic topography, where she was greeted by the then Mayor of Mumbai Shraddha Jadhav, at CST, the headquarter of Central Railway zone. It was Surekha's dream-come-true as she drove one of the prestigious trains of the Central Railway, which carries the female of name; the Mumbai-Pune Railway Pravasi Sangh (association) strongly supported her to run this train. However, a commonly heard comment on her driving is that \"Women don't drive railway engines'\"."

  "text" : "Sam Charles (1887-1949) was an American artist, pianist and professor. He was born in Agawam, Massachusetts, and was a life-long New Englander, living primarily in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He served on the music faculty of Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts and at Groton School. He admired and performed the music of modern (to his time) French composers, particularly Claude Debussy. He was a well-known New England artist, painting primarily landscapes in watercolor, with a unique, free-flowing style, making skilled use of unpainted space. He was also a very talented artist in oil, and painted at least two portraits - one of Rosalia B. Parker (Mrs. Maurice W. Parker, Sr.) and one of her father, Louis Besserer.Charles was a dear friend of the Parker family, and visited their home in Cohasset, Massachusetts often, which had the advantage of having no close neighbors, so he could play piano as loud and long as he wanted without disturbing anyone. In describing Charles' painting technique, Boston Globe writer A. J. Philpott credited Charles with having “a style all his own” and being one who is “is impressionistic and gets his effects with a rare economy of line and color.” His works were described by fellow Globe writer Edgar J. Driscoll, Jr. as follows: “Simplicity is the key to most of his works, for the artist describes with spare brush work the out-of-doors scenes which catch his eye. The results have a great deal of quiet charm.” Charles visited Europe on multiple occasions, performed piano there and painted a number of “bright, fresh, clear and happy recordings of sleeping European villages” in addition to the numerous New England scenes he painted."

  "text" : "Steve Mizerany (died April 15, 2011) was an American business owner and media personality. Mizerany was known in St. Louis, Missouri for the outsized personality he displayed as the star of his own advertisements. Mizerany grew up in the LaSalle Park neighborhood of St. Louis and was graduated from McKinley High School. He was the youngest of seven children; his parents were Lebanese Maronite immigrants. His father taught English to other Lebanese immigrants at St. Raymond’s Maronite Church. In 1946 Steve’s two oldest brothers opened the Mizerany Brothers appliance store on Broadway. Steve Mizerany went to work for his brothers and handled the store's television advertisements. All television was live at that time, and Mizerany ad-libbed the commercials as the cameras were rolling. Here he developed his zany persona which attracted attention and some complaints. In 1972, Mizerany opened the Mizerany-Farhatt New Deal Appliance Company next to Bevo Mill on Gravois Road in St. Louis with his childhood friend Joe Farhatt. Here he perfected his advertising style, an admixture of his distinct voice, enthusiastic persona, outlandish attire, slapstick humor, and stunts such as roller-skating in the store's aisles (he also sometimes skated during regular business, rolling up to customers and introducing himself). Taglines included the assertion that the store was home of the \"decent boys\". Mizerany also guest-starred in other ads for other businesses. After his death, Mizerany was honored by the St. Louis Board of Aldermen for his charitable activities which included organizing the annual St. Louis police relief celebrity ballgame. Mizerany married Sue Grant in 1947; they were divorced in 1973. They had five children: Catherine Mizerany, Stephanie Dorris, Veronica Miller, Steve Mizerany, Jr. and Vincent Mizerany."

  "text" : "Stella Adams was a prolific actress of the silent and early sound film eras. Her forte was in \"shorts\": films considered too short to be classified as featured films (although there is no standard definition as to what constitutes \"too short\"). Although she appeared in only twelve feature films, she acted in almost 150 shorts during the silent era, mostly in starring or featured roles. Her first acting credit was one of those feature films, 1909's In the Sultan's Power, in which she had a starring role. The film was remarkable because it was the first film shot entirely on the west coast of the United States. At this point in the film industry, most films were still shot in New Jersey and New York. Twenty years passed before Adams made another feature film, when she appeared in a featured role in the silent/sound film, Me, Gangster, directed by Raoul Walsh. Over the next eight years, Adams made another ten films, although in smaller and smaller roles, retiring in 1936. Adams died in Woodland Hills, California on September 17, 1961, and was interred in Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles."

Appointed in February 2014, it followed a period as Deputy Editor in chief of the only two English publications in the Kingdom and more than ten years of “hands on” experience at all levels in the industry. It was an appointment made on the basis of her experience and formidable organisational skills; perceptive and intelligent reporting; not a little courage and a great deal of hard work. Her previous responsibilities as Executive Editor, Managing Editor and Deputy Editor in chief were all first-time positions for a Saudi woman where Kingdom newspapers are concerned. An author of hundreds of articles, and doughty promoter of women’s issues, Somayya has reported on a spectrum of subjects from women’s issues through a sometimes socially challenging opinion column to the stepping down of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Never one to sidestep personal risk if it gained a story, she was the only Saudi reporter on the ground in the midst of the revolution in Tahrir Square. The job of Editor in Chief should never be awarded as a sinecure, and in Somayya’s case, it was given on merit. “It was not a question of gender but of merit that decided and earned her this opportunity,” the outgoing editor-in-chief Khaled Almaeena wrote in a farewell letter posted on the newspaper’s website in February 2014. Selected as one of the BBC 100 Women List in 2015, Jabarti was listed as one of Arabian Business Top 100 Most Powerful Arab Women in 2014 and 2015 and among Alarabiya's Top 10 Muslim women that made headlines in 2014."

By 1922, he had moved to New York City, where he briefly worked for photographer Nickolas Muray before enrolling at the Art Students League, alongside classmate Alexander Calder, under the primary tutelage of Ashcan painter John Sloan (after whom he would later name his son). For nearly forty years (from 1930 until 1968) he was the official staff photographer at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, a position that helped him avoid internment during World War II. His influential friends and admirers included artist Natalie Hays Hammond and MoMA founder Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. He became an American citizen on August 5, 1957, and died on November 12, 1971. Several members of his family followed him into the arts, including son John Sunami (a public artist, and pioneer in the field of digital art), son-in-law Robert Kopelson (pianist), granddaughter Julia Kopelson (photographer), granddaughter Jennifer Sunami (graphic design), grandson Christopher Sunami (organizer of the Columbus Invitational Arts Competition), and granddaughter-in-law April Sunami (painter)."

  "text" : "Stefan Simchowitz (born in Johannesburg, South Africa on October 8, 1970) is the Los Angeles-based art collector, art curator, and art advisor. He is a vocal proponent of social media as a legitimate vector for discovering, distributing, and popularizing the fine arts, primarily using Facebook and Instagram as platforms for self-promotion, discovering new artists, and endorsing those he already manages. Simchowitz believes that conversations on social media hold a degree of influence over the artworld comparable to other canonical forums for artistic discussion and legitimization, including art reviews written by critics for key publications. Supporters see his method as concerned with diversifying the number of systems which recognize and produce credible artists. A number of them, including, but not limited to Sterling Ruby, Oscar Murillo, Lucien Smith, Petra Cortright, Zachary Armstrong, Kour Pour, Jon Rafman, and Marc Horowitz have all been advised by Stefan Simchowitz. In November 2015, he was ranked #95 in Art Review Magazine's POWER 100, a list of 2015's \"most influential people in the contemporary artworld.\""

He was the son of general Shi Lang. In the 19th century, fictionalized gong'an (crime fiction) stories featuring him as a central character appeared in the novel The Cases of Lord Shi (施公案). Subsequently, many operas also featured him as a central character. Fictional television series featuring him as the central protagonist include: \n*  The Great Arbitrator (大執法), a 1983 Taiwanese TV series starring Tsui Hao-jan as Shi. \n*  The Strange Cases of Lord Shih (施公奇案), a 1997 Taiwanese TV series starring Liao Chun as Shi. \n*  A Pillow Case of Mystery (施公奇案), a 2006 Hong Kong TV series starring Bobby Au-yeung as Shi. \n*  A Pillow Case of Mystery II (施公奇案II), a 2010 Hong Kong TV series again starring Au-yeung. \n*  Chinese Sherlock Shi (新施公案), a 2013 Chinese TV series starring Fan Ming as Shi. In addition, the 1987 Chinese martial arts film Golden Dart Hero (金鏢黃天霸) is also based on some stories from The Cases of Lord Shi, although the film portrays Shi Shilun in a negative light."

Born in Los Angeles, Knezev grew up in San Pedro, Los Angeles, a tough blue-collar town within Los Angeles County where many emigrants from the former Yugoslavia settled. Though San Pedro is mostly Croatian, at the time of Knezev's upbringing his generation simply referred to themselves as \"Yugoslavs\". The Port of Los Angeles served as a setting for many of Knezev's character while a young writer. Knezev attended the School of Cinematic Arts with a BA and MA in Critical Studies, with an emphasis in Eastern European Cinema and American Modernity films of the 1970s."

Following his nomination he co-authored a law which allowed the government to block websites that it sees harmful for children. He also co-authored a law which would force internationally funded non-profit organizations to register as \"foreign agants\". In 2013 he spoke to RIA Novosti about prohibition of pedophilia in theatres after seeing a Golden Mask winner play called A Midsummer Night's Dream. In May of the same year Zheleznyak suggest the Duma to pass a bill that would make criticism of the World War II coalition member states' illegal and will be punished by imprisonment for up to 3 years. In June 2013 he told Economics and Life online journal that The US, which presents itself as a bastion of democracy, has in fact been carrying out minute-by-minute surveillance of tens of millions of citizens of Russia and other countries. Following this remark which was in reference to Edward Snowden's leak, he referred to anti-gay law in Russia that it is an American reproach of sticking their noses into the personal correspondence of tens of millions of Russian citizens.

  "text" : "Stanislas Hernisz (Polish: Stanisław Hernisz) (1805 in Warsaw – 20 April 1866 in London) was a Polish freedom-fighter, journalist, physician, employee of the United States Department of State and sinologist of Jewish descent. He was born as a son of the Warsaw merchant Gustaw Hernisz and his wife Karolina. He was a pupil of the Warsaw Rabbinical School. After the outbreak of the November Uprising in 1830-1831 against Russians, despite the objection of the conservative Jewish community, together with Józef Berkowicz, son of the Jewish colonel of the Polish Army during the Kościuszko Uprising, Berek Joselewicz, he applied for establishing of a volunteer Jewish battalion. To encourage the Jewish youth to the participation in the uprising, he wrote the text of the \"Patriotic Song” to the music of Frédéric Chopin song “Hulanka” (“Revel” Op. 74 No. 4, 1830), transposed from C major to E major. He was fighting in the November Uprising with the rank of lieutenant of the First Masur regiment. After the defeat of the uprising he emigrated to France and was engaged mainly in journalism. Together with Jakub Malinowski and Napoleon Kraczak he published 1833 a volume of translations from the Polish language L'exilé de la Pologne (Polish émigrés). In the Paris monthly “Północ” No. 9 from 15 May 1835 he published the article Polacy wyznania mojżeszowego (Poles of mosaic faith). During his stay in France he joined the Paris staff of the United States Department of State, and emigrated later to the United States. During his service he studied medicine and obtained the Medicine Doctor degree. He was sent as Attaché to the U. S. Chinese Mission, where he was also employed as physician. Hernisz became the member of the American Oriental Society. He published 1846 in the Bulletin of the Proceedings of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science a treatise “On the Chinese language”. In 1854, he published “A Guide to Conversation in the English and Chinese Languages for the Use of Americans and Chinese in California and Elsewhere” in Boston, Massachusetts. This book was used to communicate with Chinese workers during the California Gold Rush (1848-1855). After the home-coming to Boston, Hernisz practicised medicine, emphasizing his knowledge of English, French, Spanish, Italian and German languages. He died in London during his next journey to China."

Franse was born in Istria and grew up in Roxbury, Massachusetts, before moving to New York in 1934, settling in the East Harlem section of Manhattan. When Genovese fled to Italy in 1937 to escape a murder indictment, he left Franse to watch his business interests. Franse was a partner with Genovese in some nightclubs in the Greenwich Village section of Manhattan. In addition, Genovese asked Franse to watch over his wife, Anna. Franse eventually became partners with Anna in some legitimate business interests. In 1952, Anna sued for divorce. In court, she embarrassed Genovese by revealing information about his legal and illegal business interests. A furious Genovese blamed Franse for his wife’s defection. Genovese tasked one of his lieutenants, Anthony Strollo, to set up the murder. In turn, Bender ordered future mob witness Joseph Valachi to run the hit. Bender told Valachi that Franse had become an informer (which was not true). On June 18, 1953, Valachi lured Franse to Valachi's restaurant in the Bronx. Franse was strangled to death by Pasquale Pagano and his nephew Fiore Siano."

  "text" : "Stanton P. Sender was born November 11, 1932 in Seattle, Washington. He was an honor graduate of Harvard College and received a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1956. He then returned to Washington State, where he served as Assistant Attorney General from 1956 to 1961. In 1961 he served as a trial attorney for the United States Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in Washington, D.C. The position at the ICC introduced him to the issue that would dominate his life: transportation. The United States methods of transporting goods and materials was evolving, from domination by railroads to a diversified system incorporating air transport and trucking. Sender became a convert to the idea of deregulation of transportation and worked to forward that goal. From 1963 to 1969, Sender served as transportation counsel for the United States Senate Commerce Committee. He left government service in 1969 to join Sears, Roebuck and Company as Assistant General Counsel for Transportation and Telecommunications. This position was created by Sears to work with Congress, lobbying on behalf of the company on transportation issues. Sender was an integral part of the Sears management team, and would often steer the company around troublesome transportation issues that were subject to ongoing legislation. He was with Sears for 20 years, during which time much important transportation legislation and legal precedents emerged. Upon leaving Sears in 1989, Sender joined the Washington, D.C. law firm of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, where he continued to specialize in transportation law and lobbying. He was treasurer of the National Industrial Transportation League and belonged to many transportation-related organizations. He was chosen Man of the Year by Chilton's Distribution in 1986. Stanton P. Sender died November 7, 1995, several days after suffering a massive heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Michelle Sender, and two sons, Jason and Todd."

  "text" : "Shirley McLoughlin (born 1930) is a former Canadian politician, who was the leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party from 1981 to 1983. She was the first woman ever to lead a political party in the province. Prior to assuming the leadership, McLoughlin worked as a teacher, and served as the party's president. She ran as the Liberal Party of Canada's candidate in Comox—Powell River in the 1980 federal election, losing to Ray Skelly. She was elected leader of the BC Liberals at their leadership convention on May 25, 1981, over lawyer Tom Finkelstein and farmer Roland Bouwman. McLoughlin took over the leadership at a time when the party was in unprecedented crisis; under her predecessor Jev Tothill, the party had run just five candidates provincewide in the 1979 election, and had failed to win a single seat in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for the first time in its history. She led the party to a modest resurgence, running 52 candidates in the 1983 provincial election and increasing the party's popular vote total by over 600 per cent compared to 1979, but again failed to win a seat. She was defeated in her own dual-member district of Vancouver Centre by New Democrats Emery Barnes and Gary Lauk. She announced her resignation as party leader in August 1983. She was succeeded by Art Lee at the party's 1984 leadership convention. She later served two terms on the municipal council of Comox."
