  "text" : "Thomas Theodore Fields, Jr., known as T. T. Fields (October 12, 1912 – January 17, 1994), was a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from his native Farmerville in Union Parish in north Louisiana. He served from 1952 to 1964 and again from a combined Union and Morehouse parish district from 1968 to 1972. His service extended under Governors Robert F. Kennon, Earl Kemp Long, Jimmie Davis, and the second administration of John McKeithen. Fields's namesake grandfather, Theodore Thomas Fields, I (1846-1921), was a newspaper editor in Avoyelles Parish in South Louisiana and a native of Danville in Boyle County, Kentucky. Fields' father, Harvey Fields, a Marksville native, was a state senator for Union and Morehouse parishes from 1916 to 1920, a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission from 1927 to 1936, and briefly a law partner of Huey Pierce Long, Jr. Along with Fred Preaus, a Farmerville businessman who ran for governor in 1956, and State Senator B. R. Patton, Fields worked to make Lake D'Arbonne in Farmerville a reality. Popular with fisherman and boaters, the large man-made lake opened in 1963. Both Patton and Fields were unseated in the 1963-64 election cycle after Lake D'Arbonne had already opened. After three terms in the state House, Fields four years later won a comeback bid in the general election held on February 6, 1968. He and former intraparty rival, James Peyton Smith, defeated the lone Republican candidate, Edwards Barham of Oak Ridge in Morehouse Parish, who polled 44 percent of the vote in a three-candidate field in which two were elected. In 1975, Barham became the first Republican since Reconstruction to be elected to the Louisiana Senate. He served only one term until his defeat in 1979 by the Democrat David 'Bo' Ginn of Bastrop in Morehouse Parish. Fields was married to Ruth Atcheson \"Katie\" Fields (1914-1993), whom he outlived by eight months. The couple and other family members are interred at Farmerville Cemetery in Farmerville."

  "text" : "Thomas Billon (fl. 1617–1647) was a celebrated French anagrammatist. In 17th-century Europe, anagrams were a literary passion. In France, the Bourbon king Louis XIII appointed Billon, a Provençal, to the position of Royal Anagrammatist. His responsibilities at court were the composition of anagrammatic prophecies, and of amusing or mystical anagrams of people's names. These included numerous anagrams in French and Latin on Louis's royal style (\"Louys tresiesme de bourbon roy de France et de Navarre\") and various other anagrams and poems glorifying Louis and Anne of Austria, past kings of France, popes, emperors, and nearly all the Christian saints. Billon served as Royal Anagrammatist from 1624 to 1631, and again from 1640 to 1647, and received a pension of 1200 livres."

At the start of the 1906-07 season, the Celtic goalkeeper Davey Adams cut his hand during a benefit match at Ibrox Stadium . The injury was caused by a nail which had been inserted through a goal-post for a five-a-side tournament. As a gesture of goodwill, Sinclair was loaned to Celtic whilst Adams recovered from injury, and this is the first known transfer between the two Old Firm clubs. Sinclair played six league games and three Glasgow Cup ties for Celtic; keeping clean sheets in every match bar his final game, where Celtic won 3-2 in the Glasgow Cup final. He joined Newcastle United in 1907. Again, he was used mainly as a reserve and made only eight first-team appearances in five years on Tyneside. In these games he kept three clean sheets, conceded three goals and lost only one match."

  "text" : "Tanya-Gee Blake (born January 16, 1971 in London, England, United Kingdom) is a retired British-born Maltese middle-distance runner, who specialized in the 800 metres. Holding a dual citizenship to compete internationally, Blake set a historic milestone as the first Maltese athlete to break a two-minute barrier and a national record in the 800 metres at the 2003 Prefontaine Classic Grand Prix in Eugene, Oregon, United States, that guaranteed her a spot on her adopted nation's team for the 2004 Summer Olympics. During her athletic career, Blake trained for the Zurrieq Wolves track and field team. Blake qualified for the Maltese squad in the women's 800 metres at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by registering her career best and an A-standard entry time of 1:59.56 from the Prefontaine Classic. Unable to flaunt her stellar race from the Grand Prix a year earlier, Blake posted outside her national record of 2:19.34, but failed to advance further into the semifinals, as she was the last runner to cross the finish line in heat six."

In 1939 Joseph Goebbels recommended Propaganda Ministry staff to study Wolff's contributions in back numbers of the newspaper that he had edited. According to Goebels, despite his being Jewish, the quality of Wolff's writing was matched by only very few in Germany."

  "text" : "Shamoon joined Intertrust Technologies as a researcher in July 1997 where he worked with Robert Tarjan. Since then, he has held a number of executive positions at Intertrust, including executive vice president for business development and marketing, and head of Intertrust's initiatives in the entertainment and media sectors. He became CEO in 2003 when Sony and Philips acquired Intertrust and took it private. During his tenure, Intertrust has grown into a research and development lab as well as a billion dollar technology licensing business. Shamoon has also overseen the spin out of several new companies from Intertrust. These new companies are focusing on providing trust, privacy, and security for digital media publishing, online advertising, big data, IoT (Internet of Things), and enterprise collaboration. In addition, Shamoon has been active in founding Internet companies and startups. In 2006, he was the founding investor in Seacert, a company providing custom managed PKI (public key infrastructure) services for use with Marlin (DRM) and IoT devices. In 2010, he helped create Personagraph, a startup developing a customer understanding platform for mobile devices. Other companies Shamoon has helped to build are Kabuto (secure peer-to-peer enterprise collaboration), ExpressPlay (cloud-based service for digital media protection), and Genecloud (cloud-based genetic analytics platform emphasizing privacy and security). Under his leadership, Intertrust has also invested in startups and was an early investor in Nest Labs (bought by Google in 2014), whiteCryption, Planet OS, Kiora, and SyncTV. Shamoon also worked at NEC Research Institute Princeton from 1994 to 1997 doing research in the fields of signal processing and computer science."

Ashken attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, where she was awarded a diploma in silversmithing in 1960, and also studied sculpture at the Atelier de Del Debbio in Paris the following year. She began making jewellery in semi-precious materials in 1962. She does not draw a distinction between her jewellery and her sculpture: “her jewellery is small sculpture that can be worn.” Ashken married New Zealand artist John Drawbridge (1930–2005) in 1960 and emigrated to New Zealand in 1963. In 1966 her work was included in Recent New Zealand Sculpture at the Auckland City Art Gallery. In 1967 Ashken was the second artist to be awarded the Frances Hodgkins Fellowship, an opportunity for her to spend a year in Dunedin developing ideas for large sculptures. After this Ashken attracted a number of major commissions, including Seabird V (1974) for the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra and her best-known work, the water sculpture Albatross (1986) in Frank Kitts Park, Wellington. This was a first commission for the Wellington Sculpture Trust. Hone Tuwhare wrote a poem to mark the occasion. Art historian Anne Kirker describes Ashken's sculpture as “graceful organic forms articulated by the play of natural light”, and notes the evocation of “weathered stone or the graceful movements of seabirds – familiar components of her Island Bay home in Wellington“."

Currently an associate professor of history at Rutgers University, his general field of research concerns questions of energy and the history of science & technology in the modern middle east. He advises on modern Middle East history, history of technology, environmental history, and global history. Though specialized in middle eastern history evidenced by his first book publication, Desert Kingdom: How Oil and Water forged Modern Saudi Arabia, and noted as a political specialist on the Persian Gulf monarchies, Jones has increasingly shifted focus to questions covering environmental issues and the consequences such questions place on the processes of state formation and negotiation.

  "text" : "Thomas Townley Macan (12 September 1910 – 12 January 1985; known to many as \"Kit\", \"Kitten\" or \"T.T.M.\") was a British freshwater zoologist (limnologist), field studies director and author. He had a particular interest in freshwater invertebrates. He was brought up in southwest England, and educated at Wellington College, Berkshire and Christ's College, Cambridge. Although best known for his work in freshwater biology, his first job (1933–34) was on a scientific expedition to the Indian Ocean. The resulting volume on starfish (Asteroidea) became part of his PhD thesis. He was awarded his doctorate in 1940. In 1935, he joined the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA). He worked there until his retirement in 1976, broken only by military service during World War II. In 1941, he was commissioned as Lieutenant into the Royal Army Medical Corps,; he subsequently rose to the rank of Major; he addressed problems relating to malaria in Iraq, Iran, India and Burma. In 1946, he returned to the FBA as Deputy Director. His earliest work at the FBA was concerned with Corixidae (water boatmen) and gastropods. He then concentrated on a detailed taxonomic study of the British Ephemeroptera (mayflies), culminating in the publication in 1961 of the first complete guide to their nymphs (most recent edition 1979). During this work, he accumulated much information on the ecology of the various species, especially their habitats and life cycles. His principal locations of study were in Ford Wood Beck, a small stony stream near his home in Outgate near Hawkshead, Cumbria; and in Hodson's Tarn, a moorland lake close to the Windermere Laboratory of the FBA. After his retirement, he continued his studies in the River Lune, which runs through Cumbria and Lancashire. He was a prolific author of scientific papers and books; his Life in Lakes and Rivers (co-authored with E. B. Worthington) was at one time a set text in the Open University. In addition to the teaching he did at the LBA, he was visiting lecturer at Lancaster University (1966–76) and the University of Toulouse (1968), and visiting professor at Idaho State University (1972) and Ohio University (1976–77). He was the founding editor (1971–73) of the journal Freshwater Biology. He was closely associated with the International Association of Theoretical and Applied Limnology, in which he served as General Secretary and Treasurer (1953–68), Editor (1953–62) and Vice-President (1968–72). Among his outside interests, he was a keen sailor."

  "text" : "Theophilus Swift (1746–1815) was an Irish writer and poet. He was born the son of Deane Swift of Dublin, (who was a cousin of Dr. Jonathan Swift) and educated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1767. He studied law at the Middle Temple and was called to the bar in 1774. After practising law for a few years, he moved to live in Dublin after inheriting some property in Limerick after the death of his father in 1783. In 1789 he was wounded in a duel in London with Colonel Charles Lennox (afterwards fourth Duke of Richmond and Lennox) following deprecatory remarks he made in a pamphlet. In another pamphlet entitled Animadversions on the Fellows of Trinity College, Dublin he accused some of the fellows at Trinity with having broken the rule which prohibited them from marrying, earning him a twelve months' prison sentence in the Marshalsea prison for libel. In 1800 he was awarded the Cunningham Medal by the Royal Irish Academy for his essay on The origin and progress of rhyme. He died in 1815 in Dublin."

However, the video did not reach its peak in popularity until late 2014. An online article by BBC News included The Wealdstone Raider in the 'top memes and viral videos' of December 2014. The nickname \"Wealdstone Raider\" came from the title of the original video uploaded by YouTube user dazman21. Coincidentally, Hill claims his brother also had the nickname of \"Raider\" for the past 10 years."

  "text" : "Sir Thomas Ramsey (1510/11–1590) was a merchant, and an Alderman of London from 1566 to 1590. He was knighted, served as Sheriff in 1567–68 and Lord Mayor in 1577–78. Thomas Ramsey was born in Eaton Bridge, Kent (now Edenbridge) in 1510 or 1511, though details of his home have not been found. He was the second son of John Ramsey, with an elder brother William Ramsey, and three sisters, Tyrell, Hebbarde and Elizabeth. Little has survived of Ramsey's life and career, and a primary source, is F.W. Fairholt's study of Ramsey's wills and possessions in which he states that \"the incidents of Sir Thomas Ramsey's career have not descended to our time\"  Thomas's second wife, Lady Mary Ramsey, unlike her husband, has an entry in the Dictionary of National Biography, and this gives some additional information. After being apprenticed in London, he became free of the Worshipful Company of Grocers between 1537 and 1539, and married Alice (1492/93–1578), daughter of Bevis Lea of Enfield in Staffordshire in 1540. As a successful merchant, in 1566 he purchased a house \"with a very fair forefront\" in Lombard Street, formerly the home of Sir Martin Bowes, which was also his place of business Sir Thomas refers to \"my mansion house\" in his will, and apparently it was a large important building, having a garden to the rear and a lodge at the entry to a courtyard. A well was in the yard, and the existence of a 'spice house' is recorded. He was elected Alderman in December 1566, serving for Cheap ward, was Lord Mayor in 1577-78, was knighted in May 1578, then served for Cornhill ward from 1588. He maintained an excellent attendance record as an Alderman, and became one of the richest men in London. The Ramseys had no children and Alice died on 15 January 1577. The following year Thomas married Mary, eldest daughter of William Dale, a Bristol merchant. She had formerly been married to Thomas Avery of Berden, Essex, who had been associated with Thomas Cromwell. They had no children and Thomas Avery died in 1576. Sir Thomas, known as \"Rich Ramsey\" was active in charitable work, and was Governor of St Bartholomew's Hospital from 1559-60 until 1560-61. He was also an auditor for St. Barts in 1560-61 and was the president of Christ's Hospital from 1582-83 until his death in 1590. Sir Thomas made two wills, one concerning personal possessions, signed on 20 September 1585, and the second, concerning property signed on 9 July 1586. Money was left to relatives, acquaintances, servants and to the poor, including \"to the poore inhabitauntes of Eaton Bridge in the countie of Kent tenne poundes\". Prisons, hospitals and the Grocers' Company are remembered. After legacies and bequests, half of the residue was to go to Lady Mary, with the other half to be shared by named relatives. On Lady Mary's death, the estate was to go to named relatives. \"The Trewe Inventorye of all the moveable goodes, househoulde stuffe and plate, which were latelie the goodes and chattels of Sir Thomas Ramsey…\" dated 1590, lists in detail and room by room, the furnishings and contents of the house, with the estimated value of each item or set of items, in pounds, shillings and pence. An indication of Ramsey's importance and influence is revealed in his will, where his executors are reminded that a loan of £550 to Robert, Earl of Leicester (Queen Elizabeth's favourite), was due in January 1587. A further indication is the inclusion of the Ramseys in the play by Thomas Heywood (registered and printed 1605-06) \"If you know not me, you know nobody; or, The troubles of Queene Elizabeth\". They appear as a wealthy man with his wife as peacemaker, and Alexander Nowell, the Dean of St. Paul's as arbitrator in the dispute and seven-year-long lawsuit between Sir Thomas and the more famous Sir Thomas Gresham, the founder of the Royal Exchange. There were no children from the marriage, and after Thomas' death on 15 May 1590 Lady Mary carried on his charitable work and was a benefactress to Christ's Hospital and to Queen Elizabeth's Hospital, Bristol. Sir Thomas was buried in his parish church St. Mary Woolnoth (on the south side of Lombard Street), with a monument at the east end of the chancel. His first wife, Dame Alice, was also buried there, and the monument, which was erected in 1596, also mentioned his second wife, Dame Mary. The church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and although it was reinstated, together with the tomb, it was demolished in 1716 and a replacement church was built. Lady Mary died in November 1601."

  "text" : "Thomas Tosswill Norwood Perkins (19 December 1870 – 26 July 1946) was an English schoolmaster, a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and Kent, and a footballer who captained the university side at Cambridge. He was born at Strood, Kent and died at Tonbridge, also in Kent. Perkins was the son of the Rev Thomas Norwood Perkins, the curate of Strood in 1870, and his wife, the former Emily Louisa Tosswill; he was educated at St John's School, Leatherhead and Jesus College, Cambridge. Before going to Cambridge University in 1891, he was an assistant schoolmaster at Oxford and Great Yarmouth; he was almost 21 when he started at Cambridge. Perkins won a Blue for association football in all three years at Cambridge, but did not appear in the cricket team until his second year, when he established himself as a right-handed lower- or middle-order batsman. In his second first-class match, a 12-a-side game against the Gentlemen of England team, he batted at No 9 and top-scored with an unbeaten 57 in the first Cambridge innings. The 1893 University match against Oxford University was won easily by Cambridge, and Perkins, batting at No 8, scored 18 and 37. After the university term was over, Perkins played for Kent, and in the game against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge he scored 109, which was his only first-class century. In 1894, Perkins played in most of the university team's first-class games and scored 23 and 24 in the University match, which was a decisive win for Oxford. From this game, he went on to the Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval, appearing for the Gentlemen side which was captained by W. G. Grace. He played a few more matches for Kent in the second half of the 1894 season and rounded the year off by appearing in the Gentlemen of the South against the Players of the South game at Lord's in mid-September, though in a very strong batting side he came in at No 10. From 1895, Perkins became a schoolmaster, although he does not appear to have graduated finally from Cambridge University until 1896. He was an assistant master at St Michael's School in Westgate-on-Sea, Kent in 1895, at Felsted School in Essex from 1897 to 1900, and at Rossall School in Lancashire from 1900 to 1903. He returned to first-class with Kent in a few games at the end of the 1899 season and more regularly in school holidays in 1900: he scored 88 in the match against Lancashire in 1900 and put on 221 for the fifth wicket with Cuthbert Burnup, who made 200. He did not appear in first-class cricket after the 1900 season. Perkins was joint headmaster of two preparatory schools in the Bath area from 1904 to 1912 and played in Minor Counties cricket for Wiltshire in that period. He was then headmaster of Larchfield School at Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, Scotland from 1915 to 1932 when he retired to Kent; among his teachers at Larchfield were the poets Cecil Day-Lewis and W. H. Auden."

Browne graduated from high school in Brooklyn, NY, attended Hastings College in Nebraska, and San Francisco College. He lived in Savannah, Georgia, New York City, NY, Lake George, New York and Cleveland, Ohio; he served in the US Navy. Browne appeared on The Tonight Show starring Jack Paar and the The Mike Douglas Show. On January 20, 1965 he sang at President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Inaugural Ball. He was married to Inez Browne and had three children. In 1968 Browne was shot and killed while stopped at a traffic light while returning from a gig at the Cabaret Lounge; Billboard attributed his killing to earlier rioting in Cleveland that week. According to the book Cleveland Heights: Making of an Urban Suburb, \"The shooting of black folk singer Tedd Browne in July 1968 at the intersection of Cedar and South Overlook Roads was also racially inspired; his convicted killer had carved an \"N\" on his bullet for \"the first n----- to come up Cedar Hill.\" (page 126)"

He is best known for introducing the gypsy moth parasite to the United States, for helping establish the Washington state oyster industry, and as the driving force behind the creation of the Friday Harbor Laboratories. Kincaid is responsible for the identification and naming of hundreds of species; at least 47 plant and animal species were, in turn, named after him. In 1938 he was designated Alumnus Summa Laude Dignatus of the University of Washington, that school's highest honor for its alumni."

However, in 2014, he released his book, Going Gay My Journey from Evangelical Christian Minister to Self-Acceptance, Love, Life, and Meaning, for which Smid wrote the forward. Rymel was previously married to a woman and has two children from that marriage. In July, 2014, he signed a statement condemning reparative therapy for minors, along with eight other former prominent leaders and founders of ex-gay ministry. The statement was released through the National Center for Lesbian Rights as part of the #BornPerfect Campaign. Rymel is an LGBT advocate, speaker, author, and a weekly contributor for The Good Men Project, where he continues to publicly denounce the ex-gay movement, and call for an end to reparative therapy. He is also the author of the business book Everything I Learned About Management I Learned from Having a Kindergartner, and he lives with his male fiancé and daughters in Northern California."

He was the son of a London haberdasher, also named Thomas Blanke, and the brother-in-law of John Altham, one of the Sheriffs of London in 1557. Like his father, Thomas Blanke followed the trade of a haberdasher. He became an alderman in 1572 and served as one of the Sheriffs of London in 1574. He was elected Lord Mayor of London in 1582. He had the misfortune to be elected during a severe outbreak of the plague; due to the pestilence, there was no pageant celebrating his election, and he was not presented to the queen until the next May. Much of his mayoralty was spent dealing with the effects of the plague, and his efforts earned him the appellation of \"The Good Knight\". He died in 1588, at the age of 74, and was buried at St Mary-at-Hill; his wife lived until 1596, being buried in the same tomb. As he had died without issue, his estate at Abbott's Inn passed into the Altham family, who retained it until it was destroyed in the Great Fire of London."

He imprisoned in Bergen Belsen in 1944, at the age of 9 years. He has received many awards for his work and tireless efforts to promote tolerance and to educate young people about the importance of remembrance and reconciliation has made him one of the most inspirational figures in modern Ireland. He was conferred an honorary doctorate by Dublin City University in March 2016, citing his recent advocacy: “In the past number of years Tomi Reichental has proven to be one of the most inspirational figures in modern Ireland. His effort to ensure that the important themes of remembrance, forgiveness, conflict resolution and reconciliation remain to the forefront of modern Irish thought is truly important. In an age where we see horrific pictures of refugees attempting to flee appalling regimes to find sanctuary in the West, Tomi Reichental is a vivid example of the positive impact refugees make to modern Irish society. Honouring Tomi Reichental with the highest honour that Dublin City University can bestow is a fitting tribute to Tomi and his work.

He was an English professor at Dartmouth College and later dean at Dartmouth. From 1969 to 1978 he was president of Wabash College, and from 1978 to 1990 he was president of Rollins College. Dr. John Phillips, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities praised Seymour's work at Rollins. According to Keith Henderson of The Christian Science Monitor What Seymour has accomplished in his eight years here is \"pretty remarkable,\" according to John Phillips, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. \"He's gone against the trends.\" When others have been willing to say, \"whatever people want, let's provide it,\" Seymour has never veered from his purpose -- the establishment, as Dr. Phillips puts it, of \"a high-quality liberal arts institution in a place that's associated in the public's mind with Disney World and fun in the sun.\""
