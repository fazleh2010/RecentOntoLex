  "text" : "Urbain J. Ledoux (August 13, 1874 – April 8, 1941), later known as \"Mr. Zero\", referring to his not wanting his own name to be prominent, was motivated early in his quest of service to humanity. He sought to become a Catholic priest at 15 but witnessed a case of priest abuse and soon quit the priesthood about the age of 17. He began to work for law and business interests as a means of progress for humanity. He then sought to serve in diplomatic service for the United States with this approach and earned a few promotions. His approach of advocating for business development as a means to promote the interests of humanity was challenged, that it would be fruitless for higher aims unless personal transformation were brought to bear. He quit the diplomatic service and sought to work with non-governmental organizations for both business and peace interests. Soon he was working with the Bahá'ís and present during the conflict over the status of Sarah Farmer. He led the efforts to free her from involuntary confinement in an insane asylum, ultimately gathering a chief of police and a judge to accompany a court order to effect her freedom. He then began to found institutions seeking to aide humanity, making news first with the unemployment after the First World War among workers and veterans with a breadline in 1919. He advocated for the Bahá'í Faith albeit with a limited understanding of the principles of the religion and proceeded to set up events aimed at raising awareness of the suffering of the unemployed in New York and Boston. His efforts were seen as too confrontational and his events were repeatedly shut down even when he sought to be less confrontational and have discussions with leaders. The work was renewed with greater intensity during the Great Depression but he was in his 60s already and died soon after. Some of his work and antics were recorded in pictures and newsreels."
