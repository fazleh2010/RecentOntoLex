Son of William Zeckendorf, Sr., he was the second of three generations of one of New York’s great real estate dynasties. While keeping a lower profile than his famously flamboyant father, Zeckendorf Jr. was highly successful in his own right. Like his father, he became known for large-scale projects that transformed neighborhoods. The New York Times called Zeckendorf Jr. Manhattan’s “most active real estate developer” in 1986. At the time he was a partner in 20 projects worth well over $1bn."

He expanded the business and became the largest producer of sugar and coffee in Liberia. Entering politics with the True Whig Party Anderson was selected to be speaker of the House of Representatives. He undertook an expedition to drive a road from Monrovia to Moussodougou in what is now Burkina Faso but he was forced to abandon the attempt. Returning to Monrovia, Anderson successfully negotiated a $500,000 for the government from British financiers. However he received criticism for the terms of the loan and was arrested. He was assassinated on 27 September 1872."

  "text" : "Wilhelm Martin (20 June 1876 - 10 March 1954) was a German-Dutch art historian. Wilhelm Martin was born in 1876 in Quakenbrück, Germany as the son of Karl Martin, a geologist, and Ana Fittica. When his father became a professor at the University of Leiden in 1877, the family moved to the Netherlands. Wilhelm's two yonger brothers, Herman Martin (1881-1968, director of the Fries Museum) and Hans Martin (1886-1964, a writer) were both born in the Netherlands. Wilhelm Martin successfully studied Arts at the University of Leiden between 1894 and 1899, and became a Ph.D. in 1901 with his study Het leven en de werken van Gerrit Dou beschouwd in verband met het schildersleven van zijn tijd, the first purely art historical doctorate in the Netherlands. Also in 1901, Martin became vice-director of the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague under Abraham Bredius. Martin specialized in Dutch Golden Age painting, i.e. 17th-century Dutch painting. In 1904 he started giving private lessons at the University of Leiden. On 9 August 1906, he married Maria Cornelia Visser. They had three daughters and one son. In 1907, Martin became extraordinary professor of art history at the University of Leiden. In 1909, Martin succeeded Bredius as the director of the Mauritshuis, which he remained for 36 years. He published a second book on Gerrit Dou in 1912, together with E. W. Moes two parts of Oude Schilderkunst in Nederland (Ancient painting in the Netherlands) in 1912 and 1914, and scientific catalogues of the Mauritshuis collection in 1914 and 1915. In 1918, Martin published Alt-holländische Bilder (Old Netherlandic Images), with a revised reprint in 1921. It was aimed at collectors and contained advice on conservation and restoration. Meanwhile, he also published some sorks on 19th-century Dutch painters, including the 1915 Albert Neuhuys, zijn leven en zijn kunst, in 1917 together with G. H. Marius Johannes Bosboom, 1817-1891, and in 1921 Thérèse van Duyl-Schwartze. 1851-1918. Gedenkboek. He wrote studies on Jan Steen in 1924, 1926 and 1954. His major work, De Hollandsche schilderkunst in de zeventiende eeuw (Dutch painting in the seventeenth century), appeared in two parts in 1935-1936. In 1934, he also became the director of the Museum Mesdag, which he remained until his death in 1954. In 1935, he became director of the Prentenkabinet (Print cabinet) of the University of Leiden. In 1942, during the German occupation of the Netherlands, he gave his resignation from the University: it was accepted in 1943, although he stayed as director of the Prentenkabinet. He retired as director of the Mauritshuis in 1945, only to return for one year in 1946-1947 when his successor suddenly left. He published a few more works, including a 1947 work on The Night Watch and a 1950 picture book on Dutch painting of the second half of the seventeenth century. Inbetween his career as an academic, director and writer of art historical books, he contributed to the organisation of exhibitions, was a member of different committess on Dutch Museums and Dutch Heritage, and wrote articles for many magazines, including The Burlington Magazine and Elsevier."

  "text" : "William Adams Brodribb (27 May 1809 – 31 May 1886) was an Australian pastoralist and politician. He was born in London on 27 May 1809. His father, also William Adams Brodribb, was an attorney who was convicted of administering unlawful oaths in 1816 and transported for seven years. He arrived at Sydney in the Sir William Bensley in March 1817, and sent to Hobart. In February 1818 his wife and children arrived at Hobart in the Duke of Wellington. They settled on a farm near New Norfolk and three more sons were born. In April 1835 William junior moved to New South Wales and became a partner in a cattle station. In 1836 he overlanded the second draft of cattle to Melbourne. On returning from Port Phillip Brodribb relocated to what later became the site of Gundagai. In August Brodribb petitioned for a punt over the Murrumbidgee near his Gundagai hut and in January 1838 Deputy Surveyor General Samuel Perry reported that 'a better site could not have been chosen for a Town of the first class' in reference to Gundagai. In 1841, following Strzelecki, he formed an expedition to Gippsland which named Port Albert, the Latrobe River, the Albert River and explored inland. In 1843 he became manager of the Monaro runs of William Bradley. For the next twelve years he lived on Coolringdon station near Cooma. In 1855 he settled on the Wanganella run, near Deniliquin. He owned a series of properties in western New South Wales until retiring to Sydney in 1879. In July 1861 Brodribb won the seat of Brighton in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. In November 1880 he won the seat of Wentworth in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. In December 1881 he accepted of a seat in the Legislative Council and retained it until his death. Brodribb published an autobiography in 1883. He died in Sydney on 31 May 1886 and was buried with his family in St Andrew's Graveyard, Brighton, Victoria."

  "text" : "Walt Walkinshaw was an American attorney who “epitomized the Northwest character, old school. He was an outdoorsman, a lawyer with a strong conscience, and a passionate advocate of progressive causes,” according to David Brewster in Crosscut. Walkinshaw was born in 1917 in Seattle into a pioneering family – a peak in the Olympic Mountains is named after his father Robert B. Walkinshaw, an author and lawyer. After graduating cum laude from the University of Washington in 1939, he was chosen as one of 40 young Rockefeller Foundation interns in the federal government in Washington, D.C. He worked in various departments and ended up as a staff member in the executive office of President Franklin D. Roosevelt where he wrote reports on the various new agencies of the New Deal. Walkinshaw’s career was interrupted by World War II. He served in the Navy for five years of continuous duty in war zones at sea. He started in the North Atlantic as a deck officer on a cargo ship dodging German submarines. His Asiatic-Pacific Theater ribbon contains three stars – one for Saipan, another for Iwo Jima, and the third for Okinawa. He also received a “special commendation for performance duty in operations” against Iwo Jima. When he was navigator of aircraft carrier USS Windham Bay, his ship was in the first bloody assault of that island. American journalist Ernie Pyle was at one time aboard the USS Windham Bay, and wrote about the importance of jeep carriers in naval battles. Walt retired in 1946 as a commander. He then became a program analyst and foreign affairs specialist with the U.S. government’s Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific and Cultural Cooperation. In this job, he worked with a little-known program of technical aid and exchange of scientific know-how with South America. He worked with a staff of three to get their idea of technical assistance to expand from South America to the rest of the world. In the Mundt bill (P.L. 402), the program was passed by Congress to go worldwide, but no funding was provided. It was not until a friend of Walkinshaw’s, Benjamin Hardy, wrote the idea into the inaugural speech of President Harry S. Truman and the president announced this bold new program of aid for the underdeveloped world that it was funded and went worldwide. It was Truman’s fourth point in his speech and thus named the Point Four Program. Point Four was the first time in history that a powerful nation – in this case the industrial giant of the world – was committing itself to assist in the building up of other countries, not in order to gain dominion over them or to profit by their exploitation, but as a means of contributing to the establishment of a world order distinguished by personal freedom and social justice. Helping the world’s sick, hungry, uneducated and discouraged to help themselves became a national policy. In 1950, Walkinshaw was a representative of the United States Department of State on the Griffin Mission that went to Southeast Asia to establish Point Four. The idea of using younger people for overseas technical work was suggested in his final report for the Griffin Mission, and furthered by Lloyd Andrews who became head of Point Four. Andrews later had direct input when President John F. Kennedy founded the Peace Corps. Point Four also laid the foundation for what would later become USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development. Walkinshaw left Point Four in 1951 for several reasons. During the early 1950s, McCarthyism was at its height and Walkinshaw’s boss was accused, and then cleared, as one of ten top subversive members of the State Department. He found that many of the colleagues he respected were being driven out of the State Department. Further, an idea he promoted in Point Four of appropriate technology and small improvements decided upon by the people involved was often being replaced by Marshall Plan types of big industrial projects. He also found that most budget requests had to be tied to the military. Walkinshaw was deeply tied to the Northwest and wanted to get back to his roots in Seattle. He had earned his law degree from George Washington University while working full-time in the State Department, so he started his new law practice in Seattle and was a lone practitioner for 21 years before joining Riddell Williams law firm. Not long after moving back to Seattle, he met his future wife Jean Strong at a Quaker meeting. Jean was a graduate of Stanford University and had just returned from Hiroshima, where she worked to build houses of good will. They soon married and had three children: Charlie, Rob and Meg. Walkinshaw's wife Jean Walkinshaw also had deep ties to the Northwest. Her father was an early civil engineer who built roads including the North Cascades Highway to Marblemount and a portion of the road around the Olympic Peninsula. Mount Henderson in the Olympic Mountains is named after her grandfather. Jean became an award-winning documentary producer and produced for The History Channel; KING-TV, NBC affiliate in Seattle; and KCTS, the public television station in Seattle. She produced more than 50 documentaries. In 1992 she was inducted into the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Silver Circle for 25 years of significant contribution to the television industry and community. As a lawyer, Walkinshaw drafted many state laws that established the direction of health care, including patient bill of rights, right to die, and licensure of health care professionals. He was also the attorney for the architects who designed SeaTac and the Washington State Convention Center. Walkinshaw is listed in Men of Achievement (1973), and in several editions of Who's Who in the West. Walkinshaw served as founding secretary for ACT Theater, and remained its secretary, attorney and advisor for 35 years. He helped start the Seattle chapter of Amigos de las Americas, an organization that sends teenagers as volunteers to Latin America. He served on many others boards including Northwest Kidney Centers, Municipal League, United Nations Association and City Club. As an avid fly fisherman, he crusaded to preserve and maintain habitat and recreational areas. As attorney for the owners of the Nisqually Delta wetlands near Olympia, Washington, he steered his clients to sell their land to the government, which resulted in the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge on the delta. He was an officer and director of the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Coalition. He was a member of the Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee, of the U.S. Department of Commerce from 1980 to 1983. And he was an officer and director of the Washington Fly Fishing Club. His law partner Stimson Bullitt, remembering their long-time friendship, wrote of Walkinshaw, \"You are the only person I have known for whom I thought ethical decisions were not hard – that on coming to a moral fork in the road, you would take the right one without breaking stride.” Walkinshaw died in Seattle on April 16, 2010, at age 93. In a tribute to Walt, national correspondent Joel Connelly of the Seattle P-I wrote that Walt “became one of the self-effacing, credit sharing ‘Greatest Generation’ activists who shaped the postwar city and region.”"

Norris was a regular cricket player as a middle-order batsman in the first team at Eton, appearing in the Eton v Harrow match in both 1848 and 1849. At Cambridge, he had only one match for the first eleven, but that was the University Match of 1851 against Oxford University, when he batted at No 10 and scored 12 runs in his only innings. After this match, he played only in minor cricket. Norris graduated from Cambridge in 1854 and was ordained as a Church of England priest. He served as curate at Langley, then in Worcestershire, at Aberford in Yorkshire and at Felixkirk, also in Yorkshire. From 1860 to 1875 he was rector of Oaksey, Wiltshire, and from 1875 to his death he was vicar of Flore, Northamptonshire."

  "text" : "The poet William Livingston (1808–1870) is also known by his family’s original Gaelic language surname as Uilleam Macdhunleibhe. Born to his family’s lore in Islay in the Scottish Highlands, Livingston was a hyper patriotic Gaelic author of epic poetry. An autodidact, he was a tailor by trade, yet he taught himself the Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French and Welsh languages and during his travels through the Scottish lowlands, collected an extensive knowledge of the Scottish nation’s topography, place-names and folklore, eventually, settling in the west central lowlands' Glasgow. It is also said by Koch that William Livingston presented in his poetry “a stark view of an Islay in which the human world has been all but banished from the natural landscape.” Examples of William Livingston’s work may be viewed in the Golden Treasury of Scottish Poetry."

Ferguson in Marion, Indiana. Moore represented a constituency where three-quarters of voters were white. He is also known for helping to upgrade and change the name of Lincoln Institute to Lincoln University, a school founded in 1866 by veterans of the United States Colored Troops. Moore was a delegate to Republican National Convention from Missouri in 1928. Until Missouri's capital Jefferson City passed a public accommodations law in the late 1960s, African-American legislators were forced to stay either in private homes or in a dormitory at Lincoln University."

  "text" : "William Thomas Goodge (28 September 1862 – 28 November 1909) was an English writer and journalist, who arrived in Australia in 1882, after jumping ship in Sydney. He worked in various jobs in New South Wales, including as a coal-miner, until he was engaged to write for \"The Tribune\" in North Sydney, a small weekly associated with the \"Daily Telegraph\". From there he was chosen by Harry Newman (Member of Parliament and newspaper proprietor) to edit \"The Leader\" newspaper in Orange, NSW. Goodge remained in Orange, becoming part-owner of \"The Leader\" at some point, until in the early 1900s he returned to Sydney and began writing for that city's newspapers, especially \"The Sunday Times\". Goodge was first married on 21 January 1892. His wife died 3 January 1895 of typhoid, leaving behind two children. Sometime later he remarried and had another child. Goodge died on 28 November 1909 in North Sydney. During his writing career, Goodge wrote mainly light-verse poems and short stories. Although he did have one novel, The Fortunes of Fenchurch, serialised in the pages of The Sunday Times, the book was never published separately. His best known works were \"The Great Australian Adjective\", and \"The Oozlum Bird\". Norman Lindsay, who illustrated the reprint volume of Goodge's only poetry collection, considered the poet better than C. J. Dennis. \"Goodge, with his Hits! Skits! and Jingles!, is a much better light-verse writer than Dennis, and his book should be reprinted.\""

  "text" : "William McDaniels was one of the original pioneers of Breckinridge County, and where the town of McDaniels got its name. McDaniels was with Captain William Hardin, John Jolly, Christopher Bush and Sinclair when they came to Breckinridge County in 1779. When John Bruner and William McDaniels first came to Hardin's Fort, they brought their wives, an African-American slave, and a baby, and their possessions down the Ohio River by flatboat to settle in Breckinridge County. The Bruner and McDaniels flatboat was tied up just below the Falls of Sinking Creek. John and William went to Hardin's Fort to get some assistance, and as soon as they were out of sight, a small band of Shawnee warriors attacked the Bruner and McDaniels flatboat at the Falls of Sinking Creek. As the Shawnee warriors came towards the flatboat, Mrs. McDaniels jumped into the Sinking Creek in an attempt to escape, but she drowned instead. The Shawnee captured Mrs. Bruner, her baby, and the Black slave. Along the trek towards the Shawnee village near Fort Vincennes (Indiana), the Shawnee killed the Black slave. Because Mrs. Jolly wasn't traveling fast enough, the Shawnee warriors \"took it from her, split the overhanging branch of a tree, thrust the child's hands through the crevice, and leaving it dangle, made sport of shooting it to death before its mother's anguished eyes\". Other reports say that the Shawnee warriors stabbed her in the thigh with a knife, and scalped her, the same time they killed her baby. After several months of living in captivity in the Shawnee village, the soldiers of Fort Vincennes managed to rescue Mrs. Bruner, and aided her return to her husband in present-day Breckinridge County."

  "text" : "Waldemar Gurian (February 13, 1902 – May 26, 1954) was a Russian-born German-American political scientist, author, and professor at the University of Notre Dame. He is regarded particularly as a theorist of totalitarianism as well as political Catholicism. In 1939 after escaping Nazi Germany and taking a professorship at Notre Dame, Gurian founded The Review of Politics. The quarterly scholarly journal was modeled after German Catholic journals. It quickly emerged as part of an international Catholic intellectual revival, offering an alternative vision to positivist philosophy. For 44 years, the Review was edited by Gurian, Matthew Fitzsimons, Frederick Crosson, and Thomas Stritch. Intellectual leaders included Gurian, Jacques Maritain, Frank O'Malley, Leo Richard Ward, F. A. Hermens, and John U. Nef. It became a major forum for political ideas and modern political concerns, especially from a Catholic and scholastic tradition."

He graduated from the Department of Foreign Languages at Nankai University in 1954 and taught at Tianjin #28 Middle School from 1954-1960. In 1960, he joined the English Department (later Foreign Languages College) of Tianjin Normal University. In earlier 1980s, when in his fifties, Wang started his interest in theoretical linguistics and particularly generative phonology. In the following 20 years, he devoted himself to the introduction of phonological theories in Mainland China. He served as the editor of many major linguistics journals in Mainland China and he co-edited with Norval Smith the book Studies in Chinese Phonology (Mouton de Gruyter 1997). Wang's research applied phonological theories to the analysis of Chinese phonological phenomena. His main research was in phonology with a special focus on \"neutral tone\", i.e. syllables without or losing lexical tone. At the time of his death, he was near the completion of his project on the analysis of neutral tones across Chinese dialects (National Social Science Foundation of China)."

  "text" : "William J. Bate (April 10, 1934 – January 29, 2011) was an American Democratic Party politician who served as a state senator, assemblyman, and judge. Bate was born April 10, 1934, in Passaic, New Jersey, the son of William Warren Bate and Winifred Irene King Bate. He graduated from Public School No. 1 in Clifton, St. Peter's Prep in Jersey City in 1951, St. Peter's College in Jersey City in 1955, and Georgetown University Law School in 1958. (Bate later enrolled and earned a Master's Degree in American Political Systems from Rutgers University while serving in the legislature.) He spent six years as a legislative assistant to Congressman Charles Samuel Joelson, a Democrat from New Jersey. He was elected to the Clifton City Council in 1966, and won election to the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 1968. He served as Freeholder Director in 1971. In 1971, Bate was elected to the New Jersey State Senate. Passaic County had three Senate seats, all elected at-large, and none of the three Fourteenth District incumbent Republicans sought re-election. Bate finished third, defeating Republican Assemblyman Alfred Fontanella by nearly 8,000 votes. Redistricting for the 1973 elections created single-member Senate districts and put Bate in the same district as another Democratic state senator, Joseph Hirkala. Rather than challenge Hirkala in a primary, Bate instead chose to run for the New Jersey General Assembly and was elected to represent the 34th district. He was re-elected in 1975, 1977 and 1979. Following the 1981 redistricting, Bate was placed in the newly-drawn 34th district, which included parts of Passaic and Essex counties. (Hirkala ran in the Passaic-Bergen 36th district.) He was unopposed for the Democratic nomination, but lost the general election to Passaic County Republican Chairman Joseph Bubba by a 53%-47% margin. Bate was elected Passaic County Surrogate (Probate Court Judge) in 1982, and was re-elected in 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007. He died in office in 2011. A resident of Clifton, New Jersey, he was married for 48 years to Clara Estrella Bate, a native of the Dominican Republic, and had two sons, William E. Bate and Robert E. Bate."

  "text" : "William B. Atkins, Sr. (born June 20, 1947), is a businessman from Jonesville in Catahoula Parish in northeastern Louisiana, who served for single terms, consecutively, in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1980 to 1984 and the Louisiana State Senate from 1984 to 1988. A Democrat, Atkins succeeded District 21 Representative Dan Richey, then of Ferriday in Concordia Parish, who left the House after one term to run successfully for the District 32 seat in the state Senate. Then in the 1983 primary election Atkins unseated Richey after one term in the Senate by a huge margin, 28,724 (64.6 percent) to 15,776 (35.5 percent). This was the same election in which former Governor Edwin Edwards staged his comeback against Republican David C. Treen. Four years later, Steve D. Thompson, a real estate agent from Winnsboro in Franklin Parish then unseated Atkins after a single Senate term in the 1987 primary. Thompson received 21,576 votes (50.27 percent) in a four-candidate field. Atkins trailed with 15,988 (37.3 percent), nearly the same total that Richey had polled in 1983. No runoff election was required because Thompson received an outright majority of the votes cast. Atkins attended Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana.He formerly owned the Miss-Lou Truck Stop, Inc., in Vidalia in Concordia Parish, which was incorporated in 1994 but is inactive. He owns the Miss Lou Internet Service at 521 Main Street in Natchez, Mississippi. Since leaving the legislature, Atkins has contributed to a former House colleague, Francis C. Thompson, now a state senator, who ran unsuccessfully in 1996 against Republican John Cooksey for Louisiana's 5th congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives."

In 1850 in Washington, DC, Chaplin aided two of the slaves of then congressman Robert Toombs in an attempted escape. The slaves were Lousia and, possibly, Garland H. White. During the pursuit of the escapees, Toombs said that he was more concerned about Lousia than White, as he did not care for White. Both were caught when a posse of six slave catchers chased Chaplin's carriage out of Washington. During the chase, the posse shot into the carriage, wounding the occupants. When they were caught, Chaplin was beaten and held in D.C. for six weeks. Chaplin was bailed by prominent abolitionist Gerrit Smith and others. The money was forfeited, as Chaplin skipped bail and returned to New York."

  "text" : "Ternaux was indeed one of the great ‘lanceurs d’affaires’ of the early Industrial Revolution in France. During 1781-1789 he very capably expanded the family woolens business at Sedan from 8 to 150 looms, giving work to over 3,000 men, women and children. The politics of the Revolution interrupted his achievement and led to his exile from France during 1792-98, but he used these years to advantage by studying the woolens industry in England, Germany and Switzerland. He formulated an ambitious business plan for when he would return to France. By the time of the \"Exposition of the Products of French Industry\" in Paris in 1823, when he composed his daring challenge cited above, he had created and was orchestrating a giant mechanized woolens industry employing overall some 20,000 people. Every requirement, from the raising of sheep to the marketing of finished products, was provided for and integrated. His main factories (usines de fabrication) at Sedan, Reims, Louviers and Verviers (Belgium) employed a total of about 800 looms. He had experimental model factories for new fabrics (ateliers d’essais) at his summer estate at Saint-Ouen, near Paris. In Paris, there were workshops on the rue Mouffetard for constructing and testing new textiles machines and a chain of ten retail shops for displaying his wares, the most important of which was the Cachemire Français at No.3 Place des Victoires. His main offices and private bank were at the same address. He built a dyeworks at Ternes and a Spanish-style wool washing plant at Auteuil. He had commerce houses in cities throughout Europe as well as in New York, Mexico, Valparaiso and Calcutta. His ship, named 'Ternaux’, carried his goods to ports around the world. Ternaux contributed significantly to the introduction and perfection of merino sheep from Spain and, most famously, in 1818-19 he brought Tibetan cashmere goats to France and experimented with their fine down for his famous luxury shawls (cachemires, also named 'Ternauxs'). His private herd of about 150 goats at Saint-Ouen supplied the fine wool for his factories at Reims that specialized in high quality fabrics -- \"étoffes de goût et de fantasie en laine.\" In private societies and the councils of Napoleon, as well as in the legislative assemblies of the Restoration, Ternaux was a key spokesman for economic and educational policies for the advancement of French industry. He was a principal founder of the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry (1801) and the first manufacturer appointed to the Ministry of Interior’s advisory Conseil Général des Fabriques et Manufactures (1810). He was a respected member of the important Chamber of Commerce of Paris. In the Chamber of Deputies of the Restoration (1818-1824, 1827-1831), Ternaux spoke out in favor of “liberal” measures for the freedom of commerce and industry. He advocated government support for expanding French overseas markets, especially in South America. He opposed strongly the policies of the Comte de Saint-Cricq (Director General of Customs) establishing high tariffs for the protection of French industry and agriculture. Ternaux's speech (\"In the name of industry. . .\") in the Chamber of Deputies at the time of the 1829 depression in France was a biting, summary attack on Restoration economic policies.  Ternaux was a close friend of Jean Baptiste Say, the French proponent of laissez faire economics, and he supported Henri Saint-Simon’s concept of an industrial-scientific society headed by the captains of industry. Ternaux’s contributions over 50 years to the advancement of the woolens industry in France were truly remarkable. By the late 1820s, however, he was in trouble financially and forced to withdraw gradually from the field. He found it increasingly difficult to compete with less expensive English woolens, and there was growing consumer demand by then for cheaper machine-made cotton goods. In addition, he was having growing problems acquiring fine wools for the production of his luxury goods.  His efforts to increase and improve French sheep herds had only limited success, and agricultural interests in France had succeeded in having a high tariff placed on imports of foreign wools. Ternaux decided to shift his energies and available investment capital to the manufacture of linens and canvas. He researched the cultivation of flax in France and experimented at Saint-Ouen with machines for the manufacture of linens. Finally, in 1829, he organized a joint stock company for the construction of a large, up-to-date linens and canvas factory at the small village of Boubers-sur-Canche, near Arras (Department of Pas-de-Calais). Unfortunately, just as the Boubers factory was about to begin production, the Revolution of July 1830 in France scared off his investors. The fate of the Boubers venture was still in question when Ternaux died accidentally (2 April 1833) at his home in Saint-Ouen. William Ternaux’s impressive woolens empire did not endure after his sudden and tragic death. His only brother, Etienne-Nicolas, who contributed importantly to the success of ‘Ternaux frères’ from 1795 to 1816, died in 1830. Etienne had liquidated his business relationship with his brother earlier in 1816. Ternaux's two sons, Charles-Louis (1791-1835) and Édouard-Louis (1792-1836), were unwilling to carry on the family enterprise. They refused their inheritance which was encumbered with their father's debts. Charles, in 1826, was a partner in a commercial bank in Paris, named Charles Ternaux ,J. Gandolphe & Company, No.2 rue des Fossés-Montmartre. Édouard had been a partner with his father's associates at Reims, Jobert-Lucas & Company. This company was dissolved in 1829. Ternaux was unmarried in 1833. He divorced his first wife, Françoise Lecomte, in 1795; a second marriage in 1800, to Sabine de Gonzenbach, was annuled in 1811."

  "text" : "William Richardson Belknap (March 28, 1849 – June 2, 1914), was the son of William Burke Belknap the elder and Mary Richardson. In 1880, following the death of his father, founder of the Belknap company, he became president for 28 years of the Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company. After his retirement as president of Belknap Hardware, he became the company's Chairman of the Board. He was the brother of Morris B. Belknap and father of William Burke Belknap the younger and Eleanor Silliman Belknap Humphrey. William R. Belknap was born in Louisville, Kentucky and died in Jefferson County, Kentucky. He graduated from Yale's Sheffield Scientific School in 1869, and in 1873 he spent a year traveling in Europe with his younger brother Morris Burke Belknap. In 1911 he built his home, Lincliff, hiring two architects of McDonald Brothers, Kenneth McDonald and William J. Dodd, to carry out its design. The Olmsted Brothers were hired by Belknap to create plans for the estate grounds. Lincliff was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Lincliff is currently owned by mystery writer Sue Grafton and her husband, who have worked on restoration of the building and grounds. Belknap was a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers. The William R. Belknap School in the Belknap neighorhood of Louisville was named for him. He was a charter member of the Salmagundi Club and served for three years as its secretary. He was a trustee of Berea College, and he was the founder of the William R. Belknap Prizes awarded for excellence in the fields of geology and biology in Yale's Sheffield Scientific School. In 1898 Belknap lived at 406 Ormsby Avenue, Louisville. At his death in 1914 after building Lincliff in 1911, his estate was estimated at $3,000,000 to $5,000,000. He is buried in the Belknap family plot at Cave Hill Cemetery, Louisville."

Although, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and MI5 were not able to provide any conclusive evidence of this, for fear of tipping off the Soviets that their cable traffic was being deciphered and read by Western intelligence agencies. Clayton migrated from New Zealand to Australia in 1930 and joined the Communist Party of Australia in 1933. He quickly moved up the ranks within the CPA, becoming responsible for the organisation and operation of the undercover and clandestine apparatus for the CPA while the party was outlawed. Clayton spent most of the 1940s and 1950s underground, playing a game of cat and mouse with the police and officers of the Australia's newly formed security service (ASIO)."

He was then arrested by Soviet occupation troops and sentenced a few days later to spend 25 years in a Labor camp. In the event he received an official pardon in 1961 and was subsequently released. More than three decades later, in 1993, he was formally rehabilitated when the Russian Attorney general nullified the original court decision under which Scheler had been detained. After reunification in 1990 Scheler contributed significantly to the rediscovery by researchers of what had actually happened in East Germany back in June 1953, throwing light on events which at the time had not been extensively reported or discussed in public even within the German Democratic Republic itself."

He was denied legal aid and in 2014, the Ministry of Justice turned down his claim for compensation and demanded he pay £2,500 costs claiming the DNA analysis ‘did not show beyond reasonable doubt that the claimant did not commit the offence’. The Criminal Cases Review Commission commented that they should have investigated the case more thoroughly and commission chairman Richard Foster said “I regret the fact in this particular case we missed something and I apologise to all concerned for the fact we did so.”"

He was born at Stapleford, Cambridgeshire and died at East Molesey, Surrey. Prest was educated at Eton College and for a year only at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge; he did not remain at Cambridge University and did not take a degree. As a cricketer, he played in the Eton v Harrow match in both 1849 and 1850 and made his first-class debut for a Gentlemen of England team in August 1850, taking four wickets in the game. At Cambridge University in 1851 he had limited success as a bowler and as a batsman, and he was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University. He reappeared for the Gentlemen of England in a single match in 1852, but then disappeared from major cricket for five years. In 1852, having left Cambridge, Prest bought himself into the army, joining the 6th Regiment of Foot as an ensign and being promoted the following year to lieutenant. He left the army in 1857 and returned to Cambridge where he played cricket irregularly up to 1862 for the Cambridge Town Club and for the Cambridgeshire team which was at that stage one of the leading county sides. Prest's brother Edward also played first-class cricket and appeared for Cambridge University in 1850, the year before William did."

A vassal of Roger of Montgomery, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Pantulf was accused of murdering Roger's wife but proved his innocence of the charge by a trial by ordeal. When Roger's son Robert of Belleme rebelled against King Henry I of England, Pantulf did not take part and sided with the king. Upon his death, which most likely occurred in 1112, William's eldest son Philip inherited his Norman lands, and his second son Robert received the English lands."

  "text" : "William Sidney \"Will\" Stanton (September 18, 1885 – December 18, 1969) was an American character actor, whose career spanned the first twenty-five years of the sound film era. Born in London, England, Stanton broke into the film industry at the very tail end of the silent film era in 1927, appearing in several film shorts for Hal Roach Studios. He would debut in a feature film with a small role in Raoul Walsh's 1928 silent film, Sadie Thompson, starring Gloria Swanson, Lionel Barrymore, and Walsh. During the following 20 years he would appear in another 70 films, mostly in small and supporting roles. Notable films in which he appeared include: the 1933 version of Alice in Wonderland, whose ensemble cast included Cary Grant, W.C. Fields, Gary Cooper and Edward Everett Horton; the classic Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), starring Charles Laughton and Clark Gable; the 1936 film adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's classic, Last of the Mohicans, directed by George B. Seitz, and starring Randolph Scott; The Prince and the Pauper (1937), starring Errol Flynn and Claude Rains; Howard Hawks' 1941 classic, Sergeant York, with Gary Cooper; and The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and starring Gene Tierney, Rex Harrison, and George Sanders. His final big screen appearance would be as a cab driver in the Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn romantic comedy, Adam's Rib, directed by George Cukor. Stanton would make one last acting performance, appearing on an episode of television's Schlitz Playhouse in 1954. Stanton died on December 18, 1969 in Los Angeles, California, and was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale."

From 1891 to 1895 he played occasional minor cricket for Monmouthshire as a lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. But his only appearance in first-class cricket at Cambridge was in a 12-a-side match against the Gentlemen of England; he batted at No 12 in his only innings and failed to score, and he bowled 10 overs and failed to take a wicket. Prosser graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1893. He became a schoolmaster and was headmaster of Snettisham Grange Preparatory School in Norfolk."
